good,"Very clean and safe place to work. My co-workers were very intelligent and everyone worked together as a team. Supervisors, management and field workers communicated very well with each other and all departments worked got along, as co-workers and friends."
bad,"Unless your a lead or a supervisor here, your voice has no weight. If you try to stop them from potentially making a mistake they will overlook your concerns. I felt unappreciated and devalued working there. I have more than 13 years of industrial experience and working at the facility made me cringe at the decision making from management. If your looking for a good place to work, look elsewhere.  This place will only aggrevate you!!!!"
bad,worked night
bad,"CIO and management have different stories when they do communicate. Definitely do not follow the following quote:"
bad,"Vcm unit is a labor camp. Vcm has a high turnover rate. Operators quit every few months.  There is no line between management and operators. Nothing is confidential with management. The Vcm unit is very unsafe, something bad will happen."
bad,"Most departments are good, Ethylene is the absolute worst place to be assigned. The Operations Superintendent has a reputation of being a first class tyrant and he takes pride in that. There is a lot of politics and back stabbing that goes on here. People stay because of the money, lots of overtime and you better work it or else! Besides the money it is miserable. If they got rid of some management it would be much more productive. Safety is a joke and they really could care less as lkng as it doesn’t affect their bonus."
bad,"Some management people were great, but those few that were bad made it difficult. Advancement was usually determined on how well you were liked and not on experience or qualifications"
bad,"Westlake is a good place to work. The fellow operators were all great to work with, good working environment, If you can go to work and not have any medical setbacks you will be fine."
bad,Provide oversight to multiple work areas. Audit on going safety programs and work activities for compliance. provide training and new hire orientations.
bad,If you value happiness avoid this place at all costs. Pay and benifits are average but you will work long hours 6 days a week to compensate for extreme mismanagement. The place is a disorganized mess and safety is just about chcking off boxes on an insurance form somewhere.
bad,"I would say that if your want to work at Westlake you will need to put in a LOT of extra hours!  It is definitely NOT an 8-5 company"
bad,"As I said, this is a very fast moving, fast paced job. I love working with the SAP software, and love learning new things. I had been in purchasing for many years, over to payroll, then back to purchasing. There were a few changes in the area of purchasing, but picked back up pretty fast."
bad,"You start out through a Temp service and no one at the plant has the authority to hire you. Some temps have been there months up to over a year waiting to get hired on full-time. If you work hard and prove yourself as capable you still have to wait for unknown reasons to get on full time. Bottom line; you do the same work as full time employees for way less pay. The company doesn't have a training program so its learn what you can on the run. No set breaks or lunch so if you get a chance to eat its a bonus, the supervisors or leads will not fill in for you to catch a beak."
bad,"The company is growing very rapidly but the personnel are sometime more concerned about your everyday life rather than  the job. That create a bad working environment and pretty unhealthy. Management is alright, but needs a lot of improvement. They really are starting to care more, but the overall culture need to be improved. It is not a very motivated place to work. The company is not bad thought. Their are bonus and competitive pay which is better than more, but sometime they can squeeze a little tight on budgets."
bad,"Do not get into the HR field here! You will be very disappointed! This department has been having problems for a while, high turnover rate, negativity, and toxic work environment. Most of these problems are due to the HR Manager, who you can't trust. This person will go out of their way to make your life miserable, very passive aggressive, mean-spirited, and talks down to you. This manager tries to get  information from you about other employees in the department, there is no trust, and overall a very TOXIC work environment in that department."
bad,"This review is based on the westlake location and in regards to the management staff and their attitude towards their employees which is sad, it would be nice to be acknowledged by a Hello, How are you Doing, Is their anything we need to be made aware of regarding working conditions. Regional Manager to supervisor and lead positions."
bad,"Management is cut throat! They will work your fingers to the bone! Definitely ""production"" over ""safety"""
bad,"The top heavy management at Westlake results in a waste of human resource.  If they spent more time concentrating on real training instead of kissing up, it would be a better environment for morale overall."
bad,"low pay and safety is lacking"
good,Poor leadership in my area of work. I think it's a dead in job and I'm won't get to move up like I had planned when moving to this company. I came from supervision and just thought I would be there faster.
good,"Very clean and safe place to work. My co-workers were very intelligent and everyone worked together as a team. Supervisors, management and field workers communicated very well with each other and all departments worked got along, as co-workers and friends."
good,"The management is not the best. To much favoritism, and unfair treatment. To many supervisors and made up positions for supervisors that dont warrant the scope of the job."
good,"No I do not want to add to this field. If I had good things to say, I would not be looking for a new career. The favoritism and imbalance of workload has driven me away."
good,I experienced multiple safety violations that put myself and my crew in danger multiple times. all violations we ordered by supervision. we had 3 fires in a 5 year span and I was ordered multiple times to go inside a cloud to perform duties  that would be detrimental to my health.
good,"it is hot 12 hour days, but you only work 15 days a month. It is really hot on the production floor. Rotating shifts, 4 months on days 4 months on nights."
good,"good benefits.  good flex hours good location."
good,"Especially good for people with more work time than family time..."
good,Very demanding and poor management.  The cutlure is not collaborative and team oriented.  They will overwork you if you let them.l
good,"If you dont look a certain way or know the right people you have no chance here. Only ""certain"" type of people actually get a real chance to advance. Once upper management has it out for you you're done and there is nothing you can do about it!! All of the workers talk about each other behind each others back than smile in their face. So many different attitudes, mood swings and acting. Most workers pretend to like others because they have to. Everyone blames problems on others. No one is EVER wrong! I can do this all day!"
good,"Did corporate work, followed rules and regs, not much else to say right now.  Under some managers had a lot of opportunities and learned great deal not so much with others."
good,Worked on projects throughout the plant both alone and in groups. Gained experience as an engineer but ultimately did not enjoy working there and left
good,its okay that I work here . I juste wish the the employees weren't so messy and all about themselves. a lot of potential to make money with all the excess overtime.
good,"Work at site. improvements in progress.  QC Manager clueless of labs, just wants a title. Suggest hire qualified manager.  Only care about overworking people, & doesn't listen to employees or supervisors. Changes daily, w/ workload. Micromanaged! Manager not liked by many! Can't wait to leave this micro-managed place. high turnover, stay away! They will learn, one day to listen to their EMPLOYEES!"
good,"Typical corporate environment. I know they have been working hard to modernize after I have left, assume it is better now.  Was not bad, just not what was expected for me personally.  Solid compensation."
good,This was a good place to do a CO-OP. I learned first hand how engineering from a classroom and from a book is different than working in the plants as an engineer.
good,"- Prevenative Maintenance on 3 units (PVC, VCM, and CL2)"
good,"hands on learning. honest days work for an honest days pay. some days you might not have a chance to sit down, and somedays you get slack time and to use it to your benifit by traceing lines, reading up on associated equipment, asking questions, for the more you know, is only makeing your team members more relient and you become more efficient for the plant."
good,I was a maintenance Supervisor for Westlake Chemical I originally started when Axiall Chemical bought PPG. I was very happy with my job until they changed me to the Turnaround group it wasn't a proper fit for me.
good,I wanted the opportunity to be involved with a new project was the only reason I left Westlake Petrochem. My job with Westlake was stable but I wanted to try a new adventure.
good,"Very clean and safe place to work. My co-workers were very intelligent and everyone worked together as a team. Supervisors, management and field workers communicated very well with each other and all departments worked got along, as co-workers and friends."
good,"Westlake Chemical is okay. They are not the best but when you dont have a job its a job and it pays the bills, They pay pretty well theyre work place is not the best but it is a job and they are pretty fair."
good,"They are a good company to work for.  Have been with them for over 10 years.  Good money, benefits, and enjoy participating on emergency response teams."
good,I have to maintain the machinery so is produces products on spec. Some times this is very difficult. It is a fast paced job and they expect large quantities of correctly made product
good,Westlake is a company predicated on the idea that long term benefits can be easily enjoyed via precise application of short term expense. Major maintenance items are being addressed immediately. Major expansion items are being planned and funded. An atmosphere of confidence and security is being created.
good,Enjoyed the experience and learned a lot. I think everyone there has a problem with the management but I wasn’t really associated with them much. I reported to my Forman.
good,lower management is terrible want stand up for you what so ever want train or show you any thing at all.  its suppose to be lead by example not just go do it and we will see if its right. every thing i've learned is from somebody else on another shift smh very poor supervisory skills its just to much to list.
good,"The company was a good place to work, it was clean and the co-workers were excellent people. The training was adequate and the benefits and pay was fair. Management was fair but partial but I leaned good communication skills from them. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers. They were all good people but the hardest thing was keeping up with the workload. There was too much work load for too few people."
good,Flexible work hours depending on job. Okay work environment. Upper management tends to play favorites. Steady work. Compensation and benefits worth the job
good,Stable company to work for due to ethylene and polymer unit expansions.  Even though the company is growing there are no opportunities to move into management.
good,"Westlake has been an absolutely fresh breath of air until recently. Decent benefits and pay is a little under average for this area, but overall still a good company to work for. Really like a family business."
good,I enjoyed working in a professional atmosphere. I was well treated and received good bonuses for excellent work.  My managers were very knowledgeable and easy to work with
good,My review of Westlake was I loved the culture of the company.  There was never a lack of work.  there was always something new to learn.  So many different hats to wear but thourougly enjoyed learning all of the facets of the company.
good,"Crazy days balanced out by good days."
good,"This is a great place to work if you want to learn.  It is fast-paced and they have a large range of expectations.  You will wear many hats at Westlake.  My problem is, employees are not rewarded for excellent work but instead get punished with more work.  But the people are friendly."
good,I have worked for the company now for two years and it has been a good experience. I have been learning a great deal outside and now I am a board man.
good,"Flexible hours - One day work from home option"
good,"Growth opportunity "
good,"this is a great company. it values employee's opinions. it values company's public image. besides, the benefit here is very great. it has the yearly bonus and quarterly bonus depends on the earnings."
good,"Very clean and safe place to work. My co-workers were very intelligent and everyone worked together as a team. Supervisors, management and field workers communicated very well with each other and all departments worked got along, as co-workers and friends."
good,Productive and Conservative Environment; Friendly co-workers; high turnover of contract staff depending on department.  Comfortable work environment.  9/80 and Flex Time work schedules available for permanent staff only.
good,"Responsible for developing detailed job plans including labor, materials, tools, and work procedures.

good,Life as an operator has its ups and downs long days nights away from family but you are paid well it is what you make it there are all types of people you work with some good some bad you have to navigate where you want to go
good,"Its a small plant that wants to be bigger."

good,Westlake provides excellent pay and benefits and treats their employees with respect. Low turnover rate and many employees continue working well past retirement age.

good,Really cares about employees. High paying. Sold company that is going to be around
good,Overall this is a good company to work for. I have some of the best co-workers and they have taught me about the tasks at hand.
good,"This is in regards to the abbotsford bc pipe plant that went from a professionally run production plant with record pounds of product and profit  with happy experienced employees to a back yard pipe plant with a plant manager that has no pipe experience and is a foul mouthed bully that has sent us into chaos.We are only as good as our leader."
good,Wonderful opportunity if its available. They should start giving more opportunities to people with experience but at times will not even look your way.
good,"Tight deadlines and a heavy workload. Enjoyed the challenge and the job. Co-workers were very helpful. Teams worked together well, as a rule. Worked around meetings and required activities to ensure success of project."
good,"We work 4 12 hour days 7 to 7 and 3 10's 7 to 5, During school I have just been working 2 12's on saturday and sunday. First thing every morning I conduct a safety talk to the 70 employee crew I oversee on the job. Being at Westlake I have learned a lot about communication and where it can get you if done efficiently. The hardest part of the job is enduring the cold temperatures for 12 hours a day to make sure my crew is following all safety regulations. i enjoy my time with the guys, they have have taught me a lot."
good,Worked on updating operational manuals for the boiler house. The management was some of the nicest people I've ever met. It was a long walk from my car to the office trailer in the back of the facility but that was necessary due to the tight security.
good,"Shift work is not for everyone, but it works for me.  If you can get hired here, it's the best job in a 75 mile radius.  It's a very secure place to work."
good,"Days can get pretty intense, but at night it is layed back. most of the work over in the 1st couple hours. This gives you plenty of time to train for you next area job or learn your present on better. The people who work there are among the best group of guys I've ever work with. Almost like family members."
good,Management is great and very helpful. Always willing to answer questions. Very good about leaving you to do your work on your own but willing to assist you if you run into problems.

good,Westlake Chemicals is really good place to work like any other plant job they focus on safety there are a lot of harmful chemicals there so they make sure that you have the right training you need for everyone to come home to there loved ones the same way they left

good,"I really enjoyed working for Westlake Chemical. They provide a fun environment to learn and develop skills. I never felt out of place and they made sure to keep lines of communication open, for example, I never felt uncomfortable asking questions about the process."
good,A typical day at work was fairly easy. A employee would learn everything from safety to how to operate machines. Working along side the management was one of the easiest jobs thus far. The workplace culture was a diversity of people easy to get along with and work for. I'd say the hardest part of the job was wanting to help out with something but wasn't qualified for the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comradely.

good,I worked at Westlake for 18 years in the IT department. The work environment is positive and encouraging. It is a learning environment with lots of opportunities to work on fun projects. There are some exceptional managers at Westlake. One of the best features of Westlake is that you are allowed to make mistakes and not thrown under the bus if you do make a mistake.
good,"Westlake Chemical is a great company that recently obtained a not so great company. The not-so-great companies old mentality persists to this day. Even after meeting all of the criteria to advance, they keep giving me the run-around. They will miss me when i'm gone too."
