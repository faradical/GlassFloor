bad,Did not like my experience working for this company. To much bias and management wasn't helpful. They didn't have balance work culture. Was glad to move on. Would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"it is hard do do your your job the they want everything done now but won't go get parts,or buy any thing unless you fight for it. i have never work like this they want thing done for free."
bad,"The Carlyle Group is a brand name that attracts highly-motivated and ambitious people. Your fellow workers are the best part of working at The Carlyle Group. It is important to understand that there are two silos at Carlyle, the Investment teams, and Investment Services. The Investment Professionals working across Carlyle's private equity funds are some of the best in the business and can expect a dynamic and rewarding career. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the Investment Services side of the business. While the Carlyle brand continues to bring in high-quality personnel, this side of the business has been neglected for far too long. The technical systems are woefully out of date and are in a constant state of change as the company frantically tries to cut down on manual processes that its peers have been doing automatically for the best part of a decade. There is next to no potential for advancement or mobility in the company with many mid-level employees holding the same roles for many years at a time. This frustrates the best and brightest who inevitably leave. The mid-level managers that are left behind are overtaxed and under qualified. The workplace culture discourages asking questions and the workflow seems to be one fire drill after another. I would suggest this to people looking for the first job where the expectation is that you work here for 2-years, get the prestigious name on your resume and then leave. If you are looking for a long-term career option, I would look elsewhere."
good,"Friendly environment, not very diverse, long hours, I had only a temporary job not really familiar with the career growth prospects"
good,"Good comp., solid benefits, opportunity to work with intelligent professionals. Located in a prime area of of D.C. and a role within this company gives you access to top private equity insight and a diverse network."
good,"The Carlyle Group is a very fast-paced, competitive environment. Each day was a different experience. You had to be an excellent self-starter and have the ability to multi-task and be flexible."
good,"Great pay & bonuses, offers pretty standard benefits, nothing exciting.  Siloed depending on which group you work in.  Not a very social atmosphere. Not much flexibility."
good,Small office offers quiet work environment. Coworkers are easy to get along with. Pay is on the low side and benefits weren't great. Office is in a great area of West Hollywood.
good,"The company overall is great company to work for if you are a recent graduate and love working in a fast pace accounting department. However, work long office hours often there until 12am or later during month closing and audit season. Co-workers are pleasant but not welcoming to new employees. Promotions can be awarded within the first year of working for company. But on the downside turnover with employees are high, most leaving within a 2 year time span."
good,"Interesting workplace culture. Diverse and friendly. High pressure environment, deadline oriented. Working overtime is a must. Salary and benefits are great for the most part."
good,Ok place to work. Maybe too many hours weekly. Turnover is fairly high causing the additional hours weekly. As management hires more employees the hours should return to normal.
good,Gave me great insight into a feild that I didn't know much about but sparked an interest after being there a few months. Very team oriented environment and was able to make many great connections. Enjoyed coming into work everyday.
good,A typical day at work definetely very busy and fast pace. It has a competition driven culture which makes your day always challenging and stresfull. It has a strong management and corporate structures.
good,"The job has the potential to be the best thing possible, but depending on which team you are on and report to this can completely change. it is 100% dependent on the people you have to work with unfortunately because they control your advancement, your opportunities and your bonus."
good,"Everyone is great to work with on the staff/senior/manager level; not so much above. The accountants in Partnership Accounting do the majority of the work, with no overtime, lower salaries and lower bonuses."
good,"I was hired at Carlyle on a temporary assignment. The work was interesting and the people are nice. I had a good experience there, but did not get the opportunity to stay on a permanent basis"
good,Carlyle work place is very diverse and is always busy. There is never a time when you will be at your desk for too long working at the service desk .  So if you don't like a fast pace environment this job is not for you.
good,"Free coffee for all employees."
good,"Enjoyed daily interaction with residents, police department, magistrate, tax & court personnel. The welcome challenge was the varied workday as it was never the same day twice."
good,High performing environment. Tons of smart people willing to help you succeed. Not a place that everything can be mastered. The work is rigorous and if you excel the company promotes from within.
good,"awesome location had a lot to do in one day it was fuuun , the location was near all the shops and the location was easy to get to. I had a great lunch everyday"
good,"A typical day there for me would be different every day, it was never the same. I have gained a lot of troubleshooting skills and able to identify things I couldn't do at first. Management is the best I ever had so far. My co-workers are some of the most helpful and friendly people to work with, we  got the job done. The hardest thing for me was balancing my down time more effectively. The most enjoyable part of the job was to put a smile on a customer face and my team mates."
good,"Regular day is hectic.... and they keep you busy, no growth at all..."
good,I was honored to have this experience. I loved the tenants and new costumers. It was a family environment.
good,"Good experience, great team, fanstic chance to get a foot in the door. I learned to multitask, manage stress and be the point of primary contact at almost all times."
good,"The Carlyle Group is a very good group company to work for overall.  However, IT absolutely is horrible.  A lot of backstabbing and the management is horrible.  Follow-up on issues is virtually non-existent.    Management degrades their employees right in front of others and more."
good,I worked for 5 months at Carlyle Group's offices on Pennsylvania Avenue.
good,"Good Work Culture. Good learning in different modules. Got opportunity to work on core financial modules."
good,"Teamwork and communication were strong, and office dynamic was impeccable. Working here gave me so much experience that I am grateful for having learned. Allowing me to take these skills to a higher position in the future."
good,"Relaxed work environment."
good,"Management is very good."
good,I've had a great time at TCG in NYC. The culture is great and I could never complain about my benefits or pay because they were fantastic from the start. TCG is professional but not Ridge company where you feel like you can't grow as an employee or person.
good,The Carlyle group was a great company to work for. I gain most of my experience with outlook at this position. The Carlyle Group gave me the chance to build in my hardware issue. Here i was able to leave my desk and assist the user desk side.
good,"Carlyle is a fantastic place to work with many great benefits and wonderful people.  I have been here for almost 11 years and can say I have learned a great deal from all the employee training they provide.  This is a very employee friendly company and although I love it here, I feel I need more of a challenge in my career."
good,"I am a intern here, it has been great working here. The environment is one where you are encouraged to grow and improve. I am reminded everyday what I could be doing and should be doing to advance in my career. I love how I am given freedom to explore my options where I could go in the future."
good,"Working for the Carlyle was a wonderful experience. I learned a lot and I learned it very quickly. I was constantly on my feet assisting the office. A typical day consisted of me executing my daily tasks such as managing office supplies, greeting esteemed guests, managing travel calendars, booking conference rooms, managing mail, managing food and office supply websites based on demand in the office and more. On top of my daily requirements I was constantly assisting the teams on highly important projects through which I learned about each every facet of the office. The management was very helpful but also very demanding needing consistent and reliable assistance. My co-workers are wonderful and nice people."
good,"Great organization and corporate culture. Everyone is intelligent, friendly, and interesting. You can learn and share a lot from your fellow employees. Work every day like it's your last."
good,"Trouble shooting, running cables, imaging configuration, as well as setting up work stations for new hires and desk moves for current employees as you will see from the attached resume. I’ve built my career in a variety of roles and industries. Recently, I had the chance to take on the task of organizing and scheduling over 14 desk set ups in two days at my internship The Carlyle Group. I used my analyzing, Microsoft office and time management skills to get them all completed. Additionally, I used Outlook for emailing and to coordinate my projects, using the calendar and task functions to organize and complete my work on time. I use excel to keep record of all equipment in an inventory spread sheet I update daily. Keeping track of the highest volume of information, people, events, tasks and preferences without dropping ball."
good,The Carlyle Group employs hard working but fun individuals. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful to one another. They expect a lot out of you and pay/benefits are commiserate with their expectations.
good,Everyone was pretty nice for the most part. There were some people with terrible attitudes but it wasn’t that many. The work was pretty simple too. Management was a cool too.
good,Working at the Carlyle Group has been a truly enjoyable experience. The work environment is very supportive and positive. Working at the Carlyle Group has taught me that combined effort from a team seeking the same goal is an extremely powerful force.
good,The Carlyle Group is definitely a place I would recommend working at. The opportunity to grow and be recognized for your work is there. A lot of experience can be gained by working there.
good,"Exceptional company, wonderful people, 10/10 recommend - beautiful office space in the heart of DC. Although business professional everyone is very down to earth and great co-workers from the analyst to C-Suite level."
good,A typical day is never dull. Management has an open door policy. The schedule is flexible outside of tax season.
