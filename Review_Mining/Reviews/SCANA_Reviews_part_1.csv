bad,A great place to work and the pay is wonderful. Management and other upper individuals were okay but the company was not too good in whole. Can definitely build while working there though
bad,"Call centers are not for everyone, I enjoyed making new friends but the job was just not for me."
bad,"This is by far the most stressful job I have ever had. You will never have a permanent shift. New shifts are bid on every 6 months and you get to pick your shift in order of which employees have the most points. Points are awarded for seniority and can be awarded or taken away for accuracy of calls, being on time, using ""personal time"" (yes, going to the restroom hurts you) and so much more. This is micromanagement to the fullest. Every second of your work shift is monitored, being available for calls, being on the phone, not on the phone but working on an account, lunch, breaks, ""personal time"" (hope you don't have a calling from nature when its not a break or it counts against your valuable points), meetings, training and even more. You do not get separate sick time and are only allowed two emergency call out days each year. If you become seriously ill, need short or long term disability or have a child you will not earn any precious points for the time you are out which means you will be at the bottom of the barrel when it comes time to bid on a new shift. The health insurance, pay and benefits that are available are pretty good but not good enough to be berated constantly by customers who do not have their service on because they neglected to pay their bills for multiple months and it is always your fault. The best part of this job was that it provided me with the ability to pay my bills, though I did have to be on medication to work it as long as I did."
bad,Management will tell you that they have an open door policy but when you take advantage of the open door that puts a target on your back. They would hire a call of 13-15 people then by then by the end of training there would be 6-8 people. They have mangers that would say they made a mistake with hiring all type A personalities and they will not hire like that again. They say they want change but when they feel like change is about to happen they will find anything to fire you. I would not recommend them unless you like to be worried about getting fired for the most minute things.
bad,Scana is not a bad company to work for per say but management is horrible.  However i loved working for the company its just some of the management team that makes it very hard to have a positive workplace.
bad,Average customer service job. Was grateful to have the experience. Was a contract positon. Was offered the opportunity at second job to advance and decided to take on the position.
bad,"Having over 160 years of business, it was sad to see this company go. The company was strong and covered 3 states for utilities. But we will all were blindsided by the sell of the company to Dominion."
bad,"No thank you , I worked for this company through a temp agency . I did not like working through the temp agency. My manager attitude  was nasty. This made me dislike working for the company."
bad,"If you like sitting in a cube for 8 hours without talking to anyone, this is the place for you. Slow-paced, boring, and no sense of accomplishment or direction."
good,"they are strick on adherence"
good,"dispatched orders to guys in the field. process and post work orders. "
good,A typical day includes processing payments and service orders for customers. My coworkers are a good group of people who are overworked and underpaid. There is little room for growth and lots of people have been stuck in the position for decades.
good,"Company is great, but the department and leadership where this position resides is a challenge. Favoritism abounds, no room for growth, and leadership that is punitive and not strategic are hallmarks here. Turnover outpaces the rest of the company by far, especially in public relations and web development area."
good,No room for growth. You would have to relocate to advance. I was not willing to move to Columbia.  I would recommend this job for college students or part time workers
good,"Working for SCANA was extremely stressful. Customers are never happy, you just had to prepare yourself every time you answered the phone because you never know what type of customer would be on the other end. Supervisors for the most part were very helpful, but there’s always the select few who could use additional leadership training."
good,Work to Life balance  is something hard since our department runs lean.  Enjoy the coworkers and management of the company. Company overall is an enjoyable place to work.
good,"I worked for the company for over 6 years and loved every minute there. My Co workers became my family and the culture there is simple, do the right thing for the right reasons the first time. However, when upper management was replaced the environment shifted and was virtually impossible to stay positive and do a good job. The poor choice in management asside, this a company full of excellent,  dedicated people and working with them was wonderful."
good,SCANA has gone through changes since I left them. They removed the mainframe from their IT department. They are now in the process of being acquired by another company.
good,"The typical day was making calls to SCANA clients to collect payment for services and also place work orders in system"
good,"The culture fosters a desire for self-improvement. Management oftentimes micro-manages employees, which prevents employees from learning on their own and truly self-improving."
good,Work schedule is decent. Sometimes unpredictable must be flexible. Great place to work as a start. Compensation could be better and management could follow through on promises.
good,"I came to SCANA for job security and better work/life balance. i got the better work life balance, but after 8 month 6000 people were laid off. Compensation and benefits at SCANA were nice, but without a job what really matters. "
good,Management at times was difficult to deal with.  At times favoritism was displayed outwardly.  The company has since changed over to Dominion Energy.  I have not work for them.
good,This was a great job but the project has been cancelled.  Work load was not heavy.  Management was excellent. Co workers were willing to help.  Excellent pay and benefits.
good,"The working environment is great. Sometimes it is very fast paced with multiple calls in que and other times it can be very slow, with 20-30 minutes between phone calls. You do get optional time off (without pay) or optional overtime during busy times."
good,This was a great opportunity to expand my automation skills.Exeperiencing job placement strategies was a great way to learn communicationa and some coping with difficult customers.
good,I enjoyed the one on one interaction with the patients. There was alot of charting envolved
good,"Depends on who you are whether you'll like it or not."
good,"I've enjoyed my eleven years with the company and saddened that my time has come to an end. I've learned a lot of useful, insightful and reliable information."
good,Scana use to be a great place to work. Recent things have cause the company to really cut back on expenses effecting employees. Many employees were laid off due to company not willing to finish projects.
good,"I enjoyed my time at SCANA, however, I feel that this type of job is not for everyone. I learned a lot about customer service while working there and the hardest part about the job would be dealing with difficult customers but you learn how to deal with it in time."
good,"Start at 6am and work until the all internal and external customer's needs are satisfied, which sometimes means working well beyond the normal 8 hour work day.  When working for a utility that provides energy to so many customers, you're virtually always ""on call"" and required to assist in keeping the ""lights on""."
good,The people and the work environment are good.  Overall I looked forward to going to work each day.  The recent abandonment of a nuclear construction project has created concerns that the company may be bought out and employees may face downsizing.
good,"Overall I have enjoyed my time working for SCEG.  Unfortunately, my employment has been terminated due to the abandonment of the new nuclear construction. The benefits are outstanding especially if you have young children."
good,Overall good company.. Has changed drastically over the years.. Really depends on the area and management. ................................. .    No other comments.
good,A good place to work. Emphasis on a good safety conscious work environment. Good management. Had a weight room and would allow us to perform exercises to remain healthy. A good health plan. Training was top notch.
good,"-Analyze the work load and determine priorities for the day"
good,The people were great however mismanagement of the project was a bad experience.  The failure to build two additional nuclear power plants led to layoffs and Dominion's takeover.
good,This was a fast paced call center. Great for people that want to keep very busy. Excellent training. You will be tied to the phone your entire shift and if the numbers are bad you might even be timed for bathroom breaks.
good,"A typical day at my job consort of providing technical computer support for Electric Operations dealing with smart meters data and analysis of databases that store meter data info for our industrial and large commercial customers. We assist field personnel in troubleshooting and replacing and testing meter equipment in the field. Complete service orders using our Customer Information System. The hardest part of my job is having to sit at a desk for long hours everyday, because my job centers around using a desktop with multiple screens. Our management is very supportive and are very knowledgeable of the business. I’ve learned a lot since working in Electric Operations and I continue to learn daily. Previously I worked 11.5 years in the IT area of the company proving infrastructure support. I still collaborate with areas of IT on projects so this knowledge comes in handy. The most enjoyable part of my job is troubleshooting problems and working with other engineers and technical people who are very knowledgeable of the Electric/Utility business."
good,"Productive but have to know someone to move up, and at times I had to go 2 years without a raise. Overall company culture was decent. Some people are cut throat."
good,Loved working here but they did not complete the plant and are laying everyone off. I would make a career of it here but unfortunately cannot. Some great people here too
good,Always building new lines or performing maintenance on old lines. The coworkers are the best and management is normally awesome because they were lineman before.
good,Company had great benefits and a good work life balance. Not very fast paced or a lot of room to move upwards within the company.
good,"As someone told me when I first started, I agree with ""I really think this is one of the companies where the cream rises to the top""."
good,"I would handle a finite number of task to be completed by the end of my shift. I learned how to be more efficient in fixing issues with customers' bills. Management was very supportive and kind. My co-workers in and out of my department were very friendly. Systems were having concerns proved to be the only difficult part of the job; having to play catch up, although management understood systematic issues having absolute control over productivity. The overall morale was high and maintained; it was a great experience."
good,I really enjoy working at SCANA and cherished the workplace environment. I valued the opportunity to gain knowledge in different departments of the company.
good,"This company is very family oriented, It has a private club house on the lake for employees and one on the coast of South Carolina. SCANA is principally engaged, through subsidiaries, in regulated electric and natural gas utility operations and other non-regulated energy-related businesses and very visible in this state."
good,Working for SCANA was a pleasure. I enjoyed the customer service that I provided. The most important thing about working in a call center is attendance
good,Good place to work.  Very family company and very understanding company.  Always willing to work with employees with schedules and accommodate schedules.
good,Handled in bound calls for natural gas. Scheduled turn on & turn offs
good,This is a great company.  Working in customer service is a good way to get your foot in the door.
good,Completed customer serivice training to learn ways to enhance customer service.
good,My typical day starts out with me checking my emails to see if I had missed anything the day before. Then I proceed to process the employees coverage.
good,"Scana Energy provided a great place to work that was casual and sensitive to the otherwise stressful work environment. They had an onsite gym, quiet room to relax, plus an area for air hockey, ping pong, and Foosball. The supervisors were encouraging, and engaging in a very hands on approach to any problems or complaints in the work place."
good,SCANA is a solid company with many good perks and benefits.  This is a great place to start and build a career with many learning opportunities and different paths to grow.
good,"A typical day at work involves meetings, chatting with coworkers, and getting work done.  While it is stressed that you make progress with your work and do your best to make deadlines, you are not micromanaged.  You are allowed to work, for the most part, how you want to work.  The hardest part of the job is that nothing moves fast.  You have to wait on several levels of management and several departments, such as security and DBAs, to get much done.  However, if you can get in, it is good place to work."
good,"It is a great company to work in SC. Excellent benefits and friendly work environment.  I have enjoyed working at SCANA and hoping SCNAN, now is DOMINION ENERGY,  will restart the AP1000 construction."
good,"I currently work for  a utility company that  provides gas and  electric  service. I work in  a call center with  about  60 other  representatives. I handle  inbound  calls . Customers  call to request  payments  arrangments or  stop, start or  transfer of  service. I enjoy the  peoople  I work with"
good,"I liked that I typically new what I was going to be working on while the project was on going.  The only issue with that was that once we wrapped things up, I began to not have a that clear site of what to do.  It was a very positive place to work, and I have even reapplied at a later date when I more position became available."
good,"A typical day at SCANA begins at 8 and ends at 5:00 with an hour for lunch.  However, these hours are flexible.  The culture at SCANA is very respectful of each other.  People are willing to help you with questions about your jobs.  The management is very approachable.  Code of conduct class is a requirement of employment every year.  Management expects people to follow this code of conduct.  I enjoyed my role as a business analyst.  I had the opportunity to interact with many people at the company based on my job duties and requirements."
good,"First real job out of college. The culture here is great they really train you well and encourage you to be learn everything you possible can. Everyone is always willing to help, no matter what they are tied up in."
good,"Management is extremely approachable and very transparent. They make it a point to ensure all employee are abreast to the changes in the company. Take take pride in getting to know employees. "
good,"I remember being miserable at Wells Fargo with the racisim , teller politics (laughable) , sales and horrible boss that made me feel horrible each day. While some days can be overwhelming with call volume. I know that the calls mean job security. I basically work independently and as long as i come in on time and do my job i know that i will have A JOB. I love it here ."
good,"This was a great place to work.  Plenty of sick days!!!  Brand new facility, totally state of the art.  The people there were really great.  I am still reallt good friends with many still there."
good,"SCANA is an excellent company to work for. In my nearly 20 years of experience, I have had the opportunity to work in several departments and develop my knowledge of the utility industry."
good,"Extensive Customer Service, placing order for future service and credit counseling and being apart of a team that requires a lot of teamwork"
good,I truly enjoyed my time spent with this company. The environment is super friendly. The work is difficult but the training is consistent with the job and the training never stops.  There is room for error.  If you don't understand something you can get the assistance you need without feeling bad for it.  Management was friendly and understanding.
good,This is an excellent place to work. They care about you and they will promote withing whenever they can. You will have to be on call sometimes but its ok because you are paid well.
good,SCANA Energy's training department prepared me to excel in my job as a Lead Customer Service Associate.  SCANA Energy is a family oriented company.
good,Every day you work with a great group of people who is just like your family.
good,"I highly recommend SCANA as an awesome place to work.  I have nothing bad to say about this company.  I worked there for over 20 years, and would gladly work there again."
good,"I proofread direct mail letters, postcards, emails and online ads that were mostly quick turnaround projects. I occasionally got to be involved in the design/concept of direct mail pieces. It was fun helping with the design and getting them in the mail a week later."
good,"Excellent place to work, weekly safety meetings.  Cooperation among the employees was great.  Cross training between trades and positions was great.  Hardest part of the job for me was learning my way around their area.  Most enjoyable part was the confidence they had in my abilities to do my work."
good,SCANA has been a great place to work!  The people are friendly and I have been enjoying my time over the past 2 months there.  I would recommend this.
good,I  really enjoy working at SCANA and cherished the workplace environment. I enjoy the work experience and gain of knowledge in accounts payable department of the company.
good,SCANA was a very good place to work with involved management and great collaboration from a diverse team of engineers. I left to pursue an extremely higher paying position.
good,I liked the stead pace and kept me active during my hours of work there. I felt like I got paid for the work I performed for the company. I also liked my spacious space for work.
good,Working here is a great experience. Your day consist of a 12 hour shift. Depending on the day the work load very from a light day to an extremely heavy day. All in all the best job I ever have.

good,This is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. It is a growing company with eyes on the future as they are expanding with 2 new nuclear plants.
good,Was a great place to work where team work and rewarding the employee was pushed heavily.   Your work was valued and celebrated among your peer and management.
good,"For the most part I can say that SCANA Energy as whole is fair and treats their employees with respect. SCANA Energy definitely goes above and beyond for their customers. That is rare in Corporate America. I love that the company  has gotten more involved with employees health and wellness. SCANA Energy offers breaks just so that you can exercise and I think that is awesome because most of us don't have time to exercise between work, children, running a home and life demands."
good,"A typical work day for me is going in and taking care of my daily duties. Providing service to my internal and external customers."
good,"SCANA is principally engaged, through subsidiaries, in regulated electric and natural gas utility operations and other non-regulated energy-related businesses in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia."
good,"I really loved this job and cried when I had to leave with my husband for another state. The co-workers I had were great, they offer many shifts (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). My supervisor was great, he provided feedback on areas to improve in and really worked with me to help hone my skills in customer service. The hardest part of the job is knowing the stories of people that need help and you can not help them with their situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is the events they offer especially during customer service week. A typical day at work would be answering questions related to utilities. "
good,"Assisted customers in all aspects of customer service, maintained 95% availability, maintained 101% accuracy, maintained 100.91% in total quality and ranked 8 out of 72 employees."
good,A typical day at work consists of making sure all we handle tickets that customers put in when they are having issues. There are thing that i learn everyday since we use new technology. Our management is great whenever we need something to do our jobs better they are their to help.
