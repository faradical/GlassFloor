rating,review
bad,I'm not sure why anyone would actually choose in their right mind to make the decision to work at this company as there is nothing of any good that either remains at this company or that leaves this company
bad,"No proper management structure.. "
bad,"Even with having various locations, there was only one accounting department that deals with the brokers’ customers. The communication between upper/lower management and employees was terrible. The accounts receivable department had two employees, a senior accountant (who lacks the comprehension to do her job) and an accounts receivable specialist/coordinator but the specialist/coordinator has been replaced multiple times so the only common denominator on why they leave is the senior accountant. Management should see that there is a pattern in the accounts receivable department; someone is not seeing the big picture that the senior accountant is not a substantial supervisor and should be trained or demoted."
bad,Was employed at the firm for a little over four months. Position title and duities were different from the actual position due to many mergers.
bad,Impatient and do not understand the product.  Management lacks the ability to focus the best aspects of the platform in a way that is marketable to the clients.
bad,Started working at INTL FCStone in December as a contract employee. Was told would be full time in 3-6 months. I have asked multiple times about an offer and have yet to receive one.
bad,"This is one of the worst places to work, managers should not be mangers they drink on the job and engage in petty office disagreements among their employees, managers let people call in sick every week come in late and be unfair to other employees with the workload!"
bad,I personally didn't like working there. The boss didn't provide any direction. Training was lackluster. And the ability to close business as well as building relationships was dampened due to the lack of resources.
bad,"Inconsistent management, management constantly changing, lack of direction.  If they could  work out what they want to achieve, establish a plan and remain consistent for more than a couple of months, team might be more stable and productive."
bad,Worked as a contractor with the opportunity for full time employment.  I thought the job was putting together risk management proposals.  Turned out it was a sales position and I was not interested
bad,"Worst experience ever working for this company, no matter how hard you worked or how many extra hours you put in they always wanted more, and when you're so tired of working and make an error they write you up and use it to get rid of you."
bad,"Job and personal life balance is not good, management is worst. Company certain departments are very cheap with employees. Non growth opportunities. Bad."
good,"Advancement is almost non existent, for satellite offices. Loyalty doesnt matter; they will not hesitate to cut your salary or buy you out to keep expenses low. Middle management is busy looking out for themselves. Anyone below is not in a good position."
good,"I joined INTL in Nov of 2014. Given what I knew it was a great opportunity to further my career; it offered almost all financial products my current traders dealt. Unfortunately, there were some management changes not long after I arrived. It kind of became a first in first out scenario in my department."
good,"My work day consisted of reviewing and analyzing data from around the globe and its affects on the interest rate markets so I can relay information/ideas to clients. I also arranged and executed high value transactions on behalf of my clients and the firms. "
good,"Had a bad experience with one of the managing directors, but company is solid and a good place to work."
good,"A good place to work; however, poor management and lack of organization in the Accounts Payable department made me leave the job."
good,"This is a reasonably good place to work, but nothing to write home about.  Little option for advancement and poor management"

good,"I was provided growth opportunities despite several reoragnizations."
good,A typical day at work usually consist of non stop I.T. related issues or assisting users with how to obtain what they need to work on a daily basis.  What I have learned about this company is that it's not what you know it's who you know.  The hardest part of the job is not having the ability to help someone on the spot (usually it would be something that my department does not handle).  The most enjoyable part are the people I work with onsite.
good,"lots of changes in recent years.  typical public traded company.  Room for growth is relatively small.. management is good. However, divisional heads are not."
good,Great work environment with the ability to further your career. Most enjoyable part of the job is servicing our clients to ensure happiness and customer retention.

good,"nice coworkers;"
good,A typical day at work would be assisting the Senior Financial Analyst in any way possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning.

good,9-5 with a lot of work. Fun environment to work at a fortune 100 company with alot of skilled employees. Great career starter for someone looking to start in finance.
good,"Very fast pace environment. Enjoyed working here a lot to learn but fun culture. Very stressful at times, but yet rewarding.Something new everyday. Downfall, working Holidays."
good,"I learned a lot about securitized products.I am looking for more opportunity, and unfortunately do not think that there is a lot of room to grow and advance in my career here, but my co workers are all extremely smart hard working people."
good,An excellent learning platform for recent grads. A place where one can wear many hats and take advantage of the learning opportunities provided.
good,"Lots of moving pieces. The culture can be political and it is extremely difficult for back office, as the sales team runs the company. Short sided decisions are often made."
good,Did not want to move forward with my position. I had an opportunity and they did not want move forward on the project. I want to utilize my skills elseware

good,Excelente si quieres tener un trabajo que pague bien. Pero las oportunidades de crecimiento son muy pocas o inexistentes.
good,"A typical day at INTL FCStone started with checking emails from international internal clients. If any of those emails required tasks, they were completed first, as their days were ending as ours was beginning. "

good,A very nice place to work. They are on the rise. Balance sheet is a bit constrained but the firm is a boutique . They are aggressive in the way they handle and go after business.
good,"This is the first company I have worked in the US. Although being a small company, I found many opportunities to grow, learn and implement my skills and expertise on various projects. One good thing I like about the company is that it allows you to work on simultaneous projects if you thin you are able to handle all of them together. This gives you exposure to a variety of technologies being used across the company and helps in continuous learning."

good,"When a new global head of IT took over, there were 13 established IT managers across the company that were either demoted, replaced, or fired over the course of 18 months.

All of the employees in this company were great to work."
