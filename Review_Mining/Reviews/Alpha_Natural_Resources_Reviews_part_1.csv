rating,review
bad,"equipment operations, removal of  overburned from coal, poor management and foremans, does not offer good job security, insurance benifits really bad,"
bad,They put to much stress on the workers and threaten them with their jobs if everything does not go their way            HAVE NO MORE TO TELL.
bad,learned how to run mining equipment  make belt moves power moves rock dust lay track make belt splices put in head drives.
bad,"They work culture was one of constant pressure to perform, but not given the tools or direction to succeed. Safety culture was just a discussion but not lived. the union men were in constant battle with company."
bad,"went in mines and started running the bolt machine, bolt a few places and the load the bolt machine up with bolting supplies, worked with a lot of good men and made some good friends, was hard trying to keep up with miner cutting the coal, "
bad,don't recommend working there and management is sorry. They are one sided and were never for the men. On day we were made to work mandatory days most management was not there do to there (you work for me I work for you planning)
bad,very dissappinted with the management of certain groups. If you like working 70+ hrs a week and getting all the scrub jobs because your not friends with management....goodluck
bad,"Worked for this company for years and years.  Was recently informed Alpha is going bankrupt.  Vacation time maxed at 3 weeks  beginning in 2016, 401K match no longer exists, only 24 hours of personal time(sick time) in a year.  Management has been a rotating door -while qualified individuals were in place, they were let go and replaced with unqualified, inexperienced people.  Staff is expecting pay cuts as well- and many are looking elsewhere.  Safety was a large part of the culture until qualified managment was let go.  Company has always been heavy on the management side.  Excessive bonuses were given to management in 2015 while cuts from the guy on the ground.  Such a slap in the face when years and years of my young life were spent building a career with this company."
bad,"It was a good place to work, good co-workers. The management wasn't the greatest, and didnt really agree on how they went about things but all in all decent."
bad,Coal business just is not what it used to be.  Company was not good at letting employees know about how the company was doing or about the outlook and future plans.
bad,"competitive pay, but all this company does is keep cutting there employers of everything we worked hard for at massey energy"
bad,"long work week with very little time for family. "
bad,the company no longer exists so I feel as though giving an opinion on it is pointless. so since I cant just put a bunch of periods ill keep writing until I have enough let
bad,"Company is micromanaged to death with little to no actual working experience or qualifications within management. Majority of management has college degrees and no underground working experience. Safety culture is good awful. It's a dark, dirty and dangerous job that can be very rewarding. Employer makes you feel afraid of reporting accidents or bad conditions for fear of repercussions afterwards."
bad,Dudnt care about the works but the pay was good the boss didn't do a good job and was lazy they cut corners cut bonses but better then most places it was ok thete
bad,"This job was a part time job.  Duties were pretty straight forward and easy enough.  People were nice and easy to work for.  As this was part time, there was no room for advancement."
bad,"I worked there, made good money, had lousy benefits. Now I don't work there. "
bad,"Just as any typical coal mine, work a lot of hours in not the best of conditions. Doing whatever it takes to get the coal on the belts."
bad,Alpha is a great place to work but it's a dying industry. I hope that it picks up soon. I would love to work there again. I was laid off unfortunately after 7 months of employment. The people are great.
bad,The culture speaks for itself with what’s been demonstrated in the news and Southwest Virginia. The pay and benefits are amazing. Management I have no comment.
bad,Loved working with fellow employees. Wish it were managed better from corporate level if it were maybe they wouldn't have closed the mine.
bad,"Not a company I would recommend to anyone who needs a job to support their family. You work one day and the next day you are looking for work. Yeah, the pay may be great but it is short lived."
bad,I'm filling this out to fullfil at least 150 characters because I have to. I used to work for the company but it has changed a few years ago after it went bankrupt.
bad,"Loved it there was wanting to retire at the place I worked."
bad,I work on heavy equipment for alpha natural resource I have been with these company for 8 years I enjoy my coworkers the
good,"If you like spending time with family, this company sucks. Money isnt great. You gotta use your vacations when they want you to use them. Always threatened people with layoff."
good,"long work days"
good,Productive fun place to work with lots of friendly co-workers. You do many different jobs and see lots of scenery. There is lots of wildlife. Better pay and benefits would be better.
good,"Good money,but poor management!  6 years there and no advancement. no raises,  worked a lot of 6 day work weeks"
good,"a good place to work,but the coal ind. is not very strong."
good,"Start at 11:00pm ,quit when they say your done,I learned very little from this company,skill wise.Management was overall bad at the sites I worked.The co-workers were good.The hardest part of my job was dealing with management.The best part of my job was finishing my job assignment on time."
good,"Was a great place to work untill 2011 when Alpha bought Massey Energy Company and from that time forward everything gradually went down hill. On the upside, met a lot of wonderful people here that i will always consider a friend."
good,"Day consisted of installing roof and rib bolts to comply with roof control plan. Off nights consisted of moving belt/power to advance production crews these were the tougher nights other than dealing with young management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the group of men working their, everyone got along and did what they were expected to do."
good,It's a good company. I've worked for worse and I've worked for better companies. I'm supporting my family with me employment from Alpha Natural Resources.
good,Reliance on market conditions makes long term employment uncertain.  Long commutes for employees not willing to live in rural areas where mines exist.
good,"This is not a company to choose if you want to be treated well. They came in and bought our company out and things were terrible in the workplace shortly thereafter . Poor benefits, costly health coverage, fair to poor opportunity for advancement unless you know someone higher up in the company."
good,Good company to work for as long as you follow instructions. Needs better upper management.
good,"Pretty Dusty, But good hand training. I learned the forklift, Mixing, Punch Presses, even a little Machine Maintenance.Lots of heavy lifting which i think is O.K., but given my degree I'm aiming to grow in CNC Operation, or CNC Programming."
good,Purchasing for the company is a good position. It makes for a busy but rewarding day. I feel like I have accomplished something each day when I clock out.
good,"While working here I trained employees as production techs, I worked long hours, rotating shifts, operated a coal truck. I enjoyed this job, until the war on coal took it away."
good,"Would have liked to finished by career in the industry and company.  However many challenges within the industry and company beyond my or employees control.  "
good,You made good money and they had nice benefits but you never know if you would have a job due to coal industry and then you never know if the mines would collapse and you get hurt
good,Job security is rated low because the state of the economy for coal. There is no job security and employees continue to get cut from their jobs (myself included).
good,Spent a lot of time away from family on evening shift and did many jobs in addition to my own.  Good people to work with and a very challenging work environment
good,When it was busy there was requirement to work whatever hours was needed to get a job completed and at short notice. That being said there was quiet times as well on occasion and so long as the required tasks was completed there was free time. Sometimes there appeared to be limited planning so that tasks could be completed or made easier utilizing downtime as opposed to being last minute rushes.
good,Learned alot and worked with some really nice guys just wished it would of lasted longer but due to EPA mining is in danger and have to look for a job due to being laid off.
good,"I would say the job was very challenging, and sometimes very exciting depending on your job assignment. Working with safety minded individuals helped everyone to do a better job. I guess the hardest part of the job would be sitting for extended periods of time."
good,"Due to market and political struggles, the coal industry is not a stable environment. My current company seems to be playing ""catch-up"" instead of leading the way."
good,Do not believe supervisors.  Two co-workers that were helpful.  The hardest part is working with reports.  
good,very unhappy with alpha i have my electrical apprentice card that i paid for out of my own pocket tired of trying to get in thier program for three years to better myself so i got card on my own they still wont let me use it or put my in thier program very dissapointed
good,When working for this company i had to run equipment and work on D10 and D11 machinery. You also were placed in situations where accuracy is the key. Must be very attentive.
good,"safe productive mines. Opportunity to advance wasn't there. The majority of employees are smart, hard working coal miners with a positive attitude. Overall compensation package comparable to the industry in areas they operate."
good,This company was good to work for. I worked for them for 6 years. Keeping a job with them was difficult due to the instability of the coal industry and its decline.
good,"Mix between office work and field work, great local management and fantastic supervisor. Questionable decisions by upper management and executives as well as a general downturn of the coal industry makes job security and increased compensation non-existent. Much more likely to receive decrease in benefits year over year as opposed to any increase."
good,"It is a good company to work for, just that I drive one hour and a half to work , and they just gave us our sixty day notice that our job is shutting down so I have started to look for something close to home."
good,"lazy people worked here also and again if I get paid, I'm going to work hard...hardest part was operating a shovel instead of the dozer, learned that it is crucial to communicate with my team members...enjoyable part was talking with my Lord on my hour drive home!!!"
good,"Job responsibilities are reasonable in comparison to compensation but an unstable environment (due to struggling market, cost cutting efforts, and restructuring) has caused poor morale throughout the company, especially throughout the region."
good,Working for alpha was good the management really tried to get you what u need for the certain job you was performing and really respected their workers
good,"Alpha is a great place to work,"
good,"Good Work Environment Excellent pay and benefits. Bad Management,  Emphasis on safety and team work.  "
good,High quality job but in today's economy very poor job security. Have learned to operate a variety of heavy equipment along with insuring a safe work environment. Job security is the hardest part of this job in today's economy. Daily worry of job loss is a continuous issue.
good,"A typical day (night) at work begins with doing productin reports on Microsoft Excel. After this task is complete I spend the rest of my 8 hours shift on an EndLoader working the truck dump."
good,Productive mining company. Heavy Equipment operator there for many years.
good,Had a lot of fun while working there. It was hard work at times but the crew I worked with made you feel like coming to work. I didn't care for writing cards.
good,"i work on belt lines and supervised men to do other job "
good,"Great place to work, worked day shift for a few months. Then 3rd shift for the rest of my time there. Coal mines are great to work in, but are not a very stable place to work."
good,ANR would continue to be a great place to work if the Coal Industry was picked back up.  The uncertainty of being closed down or laid off was very stressful. Great co-workers to work with.
good,coal mine decent place to work dangerous but good guys to work with
good,just don't know from day to day if your going to have a job. leared to weld and cut with torches. co worker are nice and helpful.the hardest part of the job is the night shift.the most enjoyable part of the job was learning to split diff. seams of coal with loader.
good,"equipment is kept in good shape. keep losing benifits.jdfjdvndnvd dndn.dnfodvfpivfv.ddvrodonvdfovfdv.fvofvnfpvkmfv.fovmfonvfovnfvfvrffvrf.vnfovngofovf.vfivnnbbjnbnjnvnvnvnngnnbjgkg/g.gngkg.gng.gjg,gng.gngj"
good,Spent 14 years with Massey Energy/Alpha Natural Resources. Days were mostly low stressed. Hardest part was working nights in cold weather.
good,"high pace, safety culture oriented, great paying company. the only thing that was really hard about the job was the uncertainty of the coal market & if you were going to have a job the next day"
good,I started the job being part of the migration team to change to one operating system.  Overtime was required to work both the migration team as well as get up with regular A/P responsibilities.  Learned the A/P system as well as traveled to off site locations to help to train off site A/P clerks.
good,"I started out as a coal lab tech for Massey energy company in 2003. Then started underground as a safety and production analyst to full time mine rescue. Massey energy was a good company to work for. They were demanding, but kept us working even when things got tough in the industry. It was a successful and respectable culture."
good,Long hours battle whether conditions me as a foreman they expect you to stay and get job done  helping and working with your men and do so safe but very glad to be apart  of a good company
good,Massey was a way better company to work for. the only good thing about Alpha is that they more money by the hour but also raise all the benefits so it was about making the same as massey.
good,I worked at Alpha for about 7 years. Never had any problems and liked the work. As markets worsened I was moved to a mine 3 hours from home. I took employment closer home!
good,Not a bad place to work. Its tough in a struggling coal market. Overall positive workplace. Pay is above average for region.
good,worked in a stressful environment had to make good decisions daily to make sure everything was done in a safe matter. drove two hours one way was dedicated to my job but decline in coal market I was laid off.
good,Operated and maintained a variety of equipment and machines. Served as crew-leader for 3 years to increase production and safety on the job and in the work areas.
good,"Good place to work."
good,I learned many things from my time with the company. I had a great boss and even better co-workers. I learned a lot about the coal business.
good,I have been blessed to have great jobs up until now.i was always a ulity operator and got to run all kinds of equipment every day.work very close with co workers . hardest part of the jb was knowing it was dangerious all the time. I really enjoy running equipment and see the result of hard work
good,The atmosphere gets worse every day because of market conditions and the Massey acquisition. The hours get longer and they have cut out raises and bonuses.
good,"Alpha's ""Running Right"" culture is taken very seriously and is a genuine concept that carries through most aspects of the company. Governmental regulations and a harsh economic environment has forced the company to buckle down and make some tough decisions. A company transitioned to riding out the storm and coming through the other side is their stance. Unfortunately, it provides for insecurity and low morale as an employee. "
good,"There are no days off with the job I am currently in.You are always working whether directly or indirectly.You are on always on call,and have to be involved with every aspect of the job.It is a very rewarding job although very challenging,it can get very frustrating although very fun.You have to be everyones friend and also keeper to be successful ."
good,Still the same people running the show at the Elk Run Mining complex. Not Good!
good,I've enjoyed the many years at Massey and the past several months as Alpha.
good,"Started off as a roof support machine operator for an underground coal crew, then gained foreman certification through the state of West Virginia and began managing a coal crew in the production of coal. This was a very high paying job with outstanding benefits, however with the fluctuation of the coal industry is was undependable as each week rumors throughout the company or even on the news announcing Alpha layoffs of mine shut downs but never would say what mine until the day it happened. Which leaves you in a somewhat unstable state of mind financially as you can't say that you will be able to retire with this company due to the industry and or politics. Worked several years at this mine which was one of the highest selling Alpha mines for production of high grade met coal until they laid off half of work force due to the plummet in the market for the demand of coal."
good,it was a good job to have the work was hard but the pay was very good. i liked the people. got along with most  but the fact that it was a union mines and i was a boss made it hard at times
good,"Worked hard and lots of overtime but good conditions free uniforms and always enough tools to work with , all three shifts available.  Face work and outby work."
good,"enjoyed my time and all of the people that I worked with. put in a lot of time, but it was worth it.  learned a lot of experience from great people here!"
good,"We had a small workforce that consisted of just 2 men on each shift."
good,"Good place to work, fast paced and production oriented."
good,"Started at Appalachian Heating young and advanced throughout the company. The pay was capped out at eighteen and hour. Needed more as living expenses increased, and started a family."
good,"Very fast paced environment. Very supportive management staff.  Detail-minded with a good eye for balance and organization. Finished goals set by corporate above and beyond expectations."
good,Working here is like any other coal company. As you expect its good money but there is no job security with this company. Long hours and many weekends make for very little home time.
good,"Was a transitional employee after a large acquisition, and would have like to have stayed on if relocation wasn't required.  Just wasn't in the cards, but enjoyed my experience working with the team of professionals and the management style of my boss, Director of IT"
good,Great place to work. Good people and fair management. Could plan and prioritize a little better but overall a good place to work.
good,"My day consisted of moving 'overburden' from the surface mine site to the dump site, moving coal from the mine to the pick up site for the coal trucks."
good,Liked working for alpha. Wouldn't mind in the least to pursue a career with them again. I had great job advancement and trusted employees I worked with.
good,"Very safe work environment, equipment was fairly new and was in good working condition, had a lot of outby to keep up and was very deep in this mine."
good,This job was close to home. I could spend more time with my family. Didn't have a long drive. Wages were decent. Co-workers were team players.
good,"Since Coal Industry is not performing well, Alpha is forced to lay people off."
good,Everybody here is like a family and everybody gets along with each other and works well together. I've learned a lot about accounting while I have worked for this company. The hardest part about this job right now is the uncertainty of the current state of the economy and the fear of reduction in force.
good,"Very slow to move up in position due to less work to be performed each day. Great benefits and pay, awesome employees to work with. Very team oriented. Management positions"
good,"This is a good productive place to work. Good management, not the best surroundings. I am leaving because of relocation to a new state. I would recommend this job to friends."
good,Good place to work at with multiple mines and opportunities. They offer a great benefit package. Inconsistent  management costs them a lot of good workers.
good,... and a lot of good people were sent home. It was some of the best days of my career. We made the impossible happen on a daily basis. What a team! I wished that I would get a phone call to go back to work for them.
good,I spent a year in IT working on under ground gas detection equipment and the networks that help control it.  a business friendly atmosphere with helpful people to work with.
good,The accounting department was a fun group of people who always helped each other whenever necessary.  Management was great to work for.  They really made you feel part of a team.
good,"I made great life long friends, and had the most fun out of any job I've ever had. We busted our rears but made every job fun, I learned a lott from this job. I can now run every piece of machinery in the coal mine. I can ventilate an entire mine."
good,"Supervised work crew in daily production, safety and quality. Worked with upper management on daily work schedules, business plains, overall increase of production, finding new clients and continuing meeting production, safety and quality goals."
good,Good place to work but economy has taken a toll on this market.  Work was very stable and a lot of people where and are counting on their job from here.  Management seems to be in good standings and production was good.  Coal orders just fell cause of economy.
good,"Start the day around 7:00 am then a normal day to 5:00pm …usually a 10 to 11 hour day.  Generate various types of maps throughout a project."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of planning, performing and following up on audit issues.  We often worked with many different departments and this enabled us to learn how the industry worked and how to better understand the processes that we audited."
good,"Fast pace environment, everyday is a learning experience."
good,"While working on a surface mine I was able to gain knowledge in performing preventative maintenance on heavy machinery such as, Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi, Volvo, Euclid, John Deere, and different types of mechanic trucks. I was able to receive the proper training, have the use of proper tools, and place myself in the way of safety at all times. Working daily in maintenance I was able to depend and rely on my side by side coworkers.as well as coworkers on the production side of the job. Many challenges faced hard situations while working, such as, weather conditions, long hours, and physical demand. Knowing this each day helped with knowing great pay helped provide for my family. Being able to provide nicely for my family made the challenges of this work worthwhile. In summary, while this job faced many challenges within, it also faces challenges outside of its control, jobs were reduced and layoffs were necessary."
good,good place to work good money and work a lot only a few people can work for them because of the danger of underground
good,"A good, safe company to work for. I have a long commute to and from work, and the shift I am assigned to is not working out for my family and I."
good,Alpha is a good place with exceptional benefits. There changing the safety culture from Massey energy.
good,This company is no different than ALL other coal companies and I can not say anything good about them except that it is the only option for making a living here
good,This was a great company to work for. The staff had a laid back approach to everything and everyone seemed comfortable at work and happy with their job duties. The compensation was very fair and they had a good bonus program.
good,Work your shift and go home and if they needed you to stay over they asked.I learned a great deal from all the work related classes they held.Management new what they was doing and was respected by many.The underground work enviroment was sometimes difficult.The best part was the co-workers.
good,"Over the past 20 years at Riverton Coal Production and Foundation Coal Corp which was acquired by Alpha Natural Resources in 2009, I have gained an extensive amount of knowledge through each position I held."
good,"My typical day is entering quality into a database. I enter data each day, either in Excel, Access or Oracle. I work with 40 to 45 outside clients a month.  I get along with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the family relationship you build with those around you."
good,Offer  a lot of training. Management was good. Great place to work. The war on coal cause the lay off's in mining industry.
good,It was a very fair work place. Everyone  is treated equally.  They are very competitive with the pay scale.  Very good health benefits .  Will supply any safety precautions or equipment as needed will not ask you to do anything unsafe .
good,A typical day at ALPHA consist of you being able to work for 12 hours on your feet.Working at a steady pace by helping the production line makin sure nothing runs over. The job description depends on the position your workin for that specific day.
good,ANR has been a great place to develop my professional skills to their fullest.  While there I was allowed to truly INNOVATE; to propose and implement solutions with no regard to whether anyone had ever done it that way at ANR before.  My managers and director were extremely supportive and pushed to create even more opportunities to excel and grow professionally.
good,A typical day at work would be cleaning and moving belt heads. I also sometimes cleaned scrapers for them & installed them. The hardest part of the job would be the low coal. The most enjoyable part is getting belt moves in on time.
good,I worked on all the heavy equipment and kept it up and running. I learned trouble shooting to repair equipment. The supervisors was good to work. We all got along with each other and a bunch of good men to work with. The hardest part was no parts to work with and waiting on the parts. All the training and safety we received and repairing the heavy equipment.
good,"Great company, but limited opportunities for advancement due to coal industry layoffs.  I really enjoy the work environment.  Management and the coworkers at Alpha are great to work with.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with SQL, & customizing the application around users needs."
good,"Work day started at 11pm and ends at 7am.  It was a good place to work. Was laid off do to company downsizing. Lots of incentives, ins was reasonable,"
good,Strongly enjoyed working here. People were easy to get along with and everyone stressed safety because your life really DOES depend on it.
good,"My role with Alpha Natural Resources was as a maintenance foreman. I typically went underground at 7 p.m. and came back outside at 7 a.m.. I was responsible for the maintenance of all mining machinery, conveyor belt systems, and high voltage system. I was also responsible for training new electricians. Training new electricians was my favorite part of the job."
good,"Alpha is the organization which truly introduced me into the people side of the mining business.  Other companies and personal experiences led me to understanding leading and managing people, but it was Alpha which brought everything home."
good,I liked the jobs and all of the skills I learned from the jobs but the drive was over two hours and became to difficult to work 6 days a week 12 hour shifts at times with such a long drive there and back
good,"Pay was excellent and all around great guys on my crew. Just a bad time for the coal mining industry right now, would love to see it pick back up soon"
good,Alpha is one of the top companies in the USA.  Its culture is service to employee driven and its leadership is dedicated to being accouuntable to the shareholders.  Great place to work.  This is my second tour with this company and I would remain for the next 10 years if I could.  The state of the coal industry is very difficult right now and after a significant rationalization project I will be leading it will be time for me to contribute my leadership to a new company.
good,"a typical work day involves getting to the job, seeing what all is going on for the day, making sure the equipment im using is calibrated accurately. Co workers are usually good on keeping up with everything. Management is key for our job to work properly. The hardest part of the job is when a machine breaks down. Most enjoyable part of working here is the coworkers and learning something new everyday"
good,Great company before they purchased Massey Energy.  This acquisition cost so much money that it took the company into bankruptcy.  Great salary and benefits.
good,"Loved this company. Lots of work to be done, great employee contracts, generous pay, awesome insurance, and lots of locations to choose from. Easy to grow as well."
good,"i liked the company . pay was competative / the market caused my layoff , from them ,but i would go back in a heart beat, they showed concern for the safety of there employees, and you always had the tools you needed to proform the task at hand."
good,"I set up equipment and done belt and power moves and I also ran scoop ,shuttle car, forklift and also done maintaince . I had good bosses and also has good co workers"
good,great place to work just not much family time. everyone worked as a team to get things done. a typical day you go underground get to the section do your job and run coal till time to go home. the most enjoyable part was making back out from underground safe with everybody together and not hurt.
good,"a typical day was started off with a postive additude, learned more and more about the business everyday. The management was out going and was always trying to raise high hopes, and was outstanding. my co-workers started out alittle rough, but finally they took me in as one of theirs. The hardest part of my job, was sometimes fighting through the mud and water, and hanging the air way curtains. I really miss and enjoyed, the atmosphere, and talk and joking around with my co-workers, and the rewards and dinners that we got when we hit our goals..."
good,"They also had some pinball machines. "
good,Haul coal from pits or stockpiles to prep plant. Good group of people to work with. Safety is no 1 priority.
good,"My typical day consist of managing functions for the field support technicians to ensure client issues have been addressed in a timely manner for 70+ domicile locations and upwards of 3,500 client machines. "
good,Everyone had a great work ethic. They worked so well together which made production better. The men at this mine was willing to help me learn about mining. Close to home.
good,Alpha was good to me. They always tried to keep me in a job. Everyone worked well together. Big on safety. The hardest part about the job was the drive. I had to drive quiet a distance but had a great experience there.
good,"I start work at 5:00am and I never stop till quit time at 5:pm. I would be either making roads or helping a coal truck/tractor up a steep hill. No matter what I was doing, I would work to the best of my ability. I don't have anything negative to say to the men that I have worked with. The hardest part of my job is in the winter and we have ice on the haul roads, it sure becomes interesting on a grader. I also look out for hazardous conditions such as low berms or bad walls, anything out of the ordinary."
good,Hard work but great pay and benefits. Encourages advancement and great with safety training. Management is efficient and encouraging. Hardest part of working for Alpha is the coal industry itself is too unstable.
good,"They are a very loyal and trust worthy company but with the weight of the EPA on them there funds are stressed and they are being forced to lay off hard working miners almost daily (seems like). I loved working for them, and i absolutely loved being a mechanic. I learned so much from the men that trained me, Really just a wealth of knowledge. I Changed filters oil and serviced equipment with grease dailey. Also, i was learning the art of welding."
good,"I ran a dozer pushing shot, pushing fill, working haul roads for ten hours a day, management performed very well, culture was good, the hardest part was the two hour and fifteen minute drive."
good,Best place ever to work. The people I worked with are some of the best in the business.... I would go back today if I was offered.
good,great place to work at. the demand for coal just isn't high and doesnt look good for the industry anymore. We had a great coworkers. We had fun and always got the job done.
good,"Productive and fun job to work, good equipment to operate and great for training new people."
good,"My typical day at work began at 8am with a start of reviewing emails and sending mass daily publications. Time sheets were then reviewed and prepared for processing. Once those duties were complete, I prepared outgoing mail and UPS packages for pick-up. After mail and UPS items were sorted, picked-up and delivered, I then began my techinical work day by completing expense reports, lobbying reports, booking travel, processing invoices and tracking budgets for numerous departments. Each day I would review with the Executive Vice President that I supported on what was needed specifically for that day. My day to day support included one Executive Level Vice President, two Senior Level Vice Presidents for the Sustainability department, one Vice President and Assistant General Counsel for the Legal department, one Human Resources Director, one Senior level Vice President and eight Managers/Directors for the Government & External Affairs department. These tasks were daily but not limited to what came up on a day to day basis, whether it be mass mailings, preparing for visitors, traveling, etc."
good,I loved it great job worked with a great bunch of guys pay was very good had good benefits and able to learn alot in my time underground loved the job only left cause I got laid off would still be working there right now
good,"Nothing to bad or to good, pretty ordinary, the bosses and men were great to spend my days with, it was pretty safe, and not a whole lot of worries or talk of unemployment"
