rating,review
bad,"Whilst working here, although my salary increased, which I was grateful for during my employment and due to my age, support was non existant, no warmth amoung many professional colleagues, very competitive behavior in the office, while I understand that in sport, I cannot understand that in an office.  As I am local to the office, where many people working here are not, it was sad to see this type of conduct and it crushed my confidence during this time.  I was made redundant from here around the age of 31 and I am still recovering from the bad experiences within this company."
bad,"No promotions unless you are part of the cliche. Work culture is antiquated and male oriented. Hires mostly from within but it you are not part of the cliche you are not given the same consideration as those who are in it. They put more emphasis on having the title Great Place to Work, than actually being a great place to work. "
bad,"One of the most fake places I have ever worked, no one is up front or honest, and despite how hard you work, you will be replaced if one of managements friends or family needs a job."
bad,Like I said if your not in the club your never going anywhere. Half the people do nothing or hardly ever come to work because they hang out with management. The others that don’t are left doing all the work
bad,"Company was having issues when I started in 2010.  Teams in QA had a constant change of management from director up which led to managers fighting between teams to elevate themselves at the expense of their teams.  Unless you were buddies with the managment, promotions were impossible.  Requirements for promotion were either constantly changing or never provided"
bad,"NetApp today is a place of constant change, and frequent reorganizations to meet the cost demands of a changing IT landscape.  Benefits are serviceable."
bad,The company is currently undergoing transformation. Employees morale is low and management has been tasked to reduced operating cost. All the best to the employees!
bad,"Netapp is completely full of B.S. They talk about the ""culture"" there being so great but it's no different than anywhere else. Most managers in Wichita are completely worthless and only get promoted  because they are someones buddy and not because they worked hard. Just because they give you beer every other Friday doesn't mean they have a great culture. Netapp loves people that talk a lot and do nothing. If you want to go far at Netapp, talk out of your butt and do as little as ;possible, they will love you."
bad,It is a pay check and that is about all. If you really really need a job then fine otherwise don't bother. You will not be treated with respect and managers are extremely unqualified.
bad,The company is not what it use to be.  Morale is at an all time low.   They have 1-2 layoffs every year.   Managers are not always transparent.
bad,"Used to be a very good company but in the past year or so went downhill - e.g., management line changed 5 times in one year"
bad,"After several years, NetApp became a slog.  Poor managment, lots of favoritism by some managers.  Little opportunity to advance.  Benefits went downhill year after year."
bad,Very talented group of individuals.  There was a very good opportunity to challenge myself across multiple spectrums.
bad,"The people there are focused on doing a good job.  Beer bash Fridays are great and very well attended.  I was personally very disappointed on how they handle situations that are not pleasant -  quality issues, customer complaints and poor performance of employees."
bad,Tough going. No confidence in the future plan. Zero growth and all local roles moving overseas. Staff are currently performing many roles without the chance of promotion.
bad,"NetApp has a lot of very smart engineers.  It also has middle management that is so risk-averse that the company, as a whole, cannot innovate.  This aversion to risk also leads to incredibly burdensome engineering processes, and a consensus based decision making style that results in it being very hard to get anything done.  Anything innovative or new is most likely impossible to do. "
bad,"If your goal is to learn SAN/NAS software and appliance applications for storage, you will get an introduction - but, beware of the management lack of direction and ever changing leadership for global support, it will wear you down quickly."
bad,Working with very experienced people was very interesting. Hardest part is to keep up with the changes in the organization and design.
bad,"The corporate culture isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  Management is inconsistent, fickle, and it's tough to get a clear answer on anything.  Expect a lot of unnecessary aggravation."
bad,"NetApp has a pretty positive culture. However, as with most corporation companies, dealing with long distance teammates can be very difficult. Not a lot of internal/external company ideals."
bad,Good to work here.  However there are lots of politic involve and all they care is share holder.  Employees are coming in second.
bad,"Worst work Culture."
bad,"Company is all about 'transformation', but future company vision is not clear.  Transformation is cutting costs to right-size the company.  Lots of fear and apprehension, as layoffs have become a way of life."
bad,"While at NetApp we had great people and wonderful culture, the company lost his pace in terms of strategy and direction."
bad,"In last 3 years road map is not clearly defined, every 6 months re-org and restructuring and layoffs. Not able to think straight for future."
good,"Good to work as an employee but not as a contractor."
good,Work life balance  was not there. This was a good place to learn some additional skills however there was little to know development in advancing the employees. The work life balance was not there.
good,Grew too fast. Then shrunk even faster. People don't seem to have much direction from management and aren't well trained. Too many people with similar functions adding to confusion.
good,"Overall good company trying to do the right things for its employees. "
good,"employees were scared to lose their jobs, management did not listen to employees, no open door policy, hired people that did not care about their employees - just the job.  Good benefits though - no room for career advancement depending on department you worked in.  Employees talking behind their backs at time and withholding information to keep their jobs."
good,the people really make a difference. Made many great friends many great working there. Unfortunately managements fails in making goals and giving a more defined outlook for the company.
good,Netapp is good company to work for. Currently going through tumultuous time. They have good product set and will definitely rule the storage industry.
good,"Enjoyed the people, but not management.  Long days, but benefits were good."
good,"The company is an old school tech company trying to be more fast paced and current, but its size and old-school mentality hold it back. People tend to stay in their lanes there. So you won't find yourself really collaborating on things outside of your specific role."
good,"The management style varies considerably in the company. If you get a bad/difficult manager it is very hard to make a change in the company."
good,"NetApp was a high flyer and innovator back in the day.  Now, it's just trying to get purchased, with old-line employees trying to resist changes.  Tiny cubes with almost enough room to turn around in."
good,"I don't like giving reviews. Nor do I appreciate that is now apparently a requirement of this site. This seems like a low-brow, extortionist way to build a database of reviews rather than making it optional for those who want to be part of that."
good,Great place to work!  Enjoyable co-workers and friendly environment. Experience too many events of down-sizing which decreased brand and loyalty of employees.
good,"Support excellent work-life balance. Pay package is also decent."
good,"Not very technology company.. not many products to work on."
good,"A typical day is working through my queue, taking calls, e-mails and chats."
good,Went into it being told that layoffs were over but far from reality.  Being the new person my head was first on the list regardless of performance.  There are other storage companies that compete well and have a better story than NetApp.  I am not sure of the longevity of the company?  Would not be surprised if they were bought out some day.
good,Poor leadership and lack of direction. Culture changed from great place to work to profit above all. Decisions are made without thinking of the long term consequences. Yearly layoffs.
good,I did not really enjoy my time at NetApp.  I liked that sales team that I worked with and learned a lot from them but was not overly happy with the rest of the organization.
good,"NetApp is undergoing a transition right now. There are power struggles going on but they will work through that over time. Ultimately, it will be a great place to work as they transition to the cloud."
good,"I was in the sales organization (which at NetApp is redundant because they'll let you know everyone is in sales) as a Technical Account Manager. I was told on my first day onsite that I had get along with your sales person or I'd be gone. It turns out that 95% of the entire Sales Engineering management team's function is relaying what the Sales team wants. If I were the NetApp CEO the first thing I'd do is fold the entire SE org into the sales org and trim a huge number of managers that are not adding any value to the bottom line.  The primary job of an SE isn't to make the customer's problems go away, it's to help the sales team make their numbers - and a lot of times that means pushing product that has no relevance to the problem at hand. Very frustrating and in conflict with the goal of being a ""trusted advisor."" The other thing I learned is that the sales people will trust instinct long before they trust data or experience. This means that often times strategy is set more by chicken bones and chants than by taking time to understand what the customers needs are now and in the future. Future needs were often kneecapped by quarter end (and new product introduction) goals."
good,"Seemed that direction setting was something that exec management had never heard of. They also created a culture of fear. A lot of attention was paid to their ""Great places to work"" ranking, rather than actually making it a great places to work. Innovation had ground to a halt and they were blindsided by the cloud and flash technologies."
good,Fast-paced environment. Great place to learn new skills.  Free snack bar and good pay for the location.  Strict protocol working environment. You need to be a fast learner
good,"Excellent exposure to technology without work life balance."
good,NetApp still has a good company culture and a good work life balance. It's hard to grow in certain departments because a lot of people have been here a long time. The downside to working here is that the company is continuing to downsize. I think the company is still trying to come up with a concrete identity.
good,"Great work/life balance so far, but their re-org is being poorly handled. Employees need to be treated like humans, not human ""capital."" Hoping to see a culture change at NetApp and a return to human values."
good,"PROS:"
good,"My coworkers there were very fun. We had a great bond. I liked how they always encouraged innovation. "
good,"It' s a good  company to work for but connections and preferential treatment gets in the way of work.  People are targeted right off the bat when they get hired if they are setup to succeed or fail. In terms of training, mentorship, given visible and great projects to work on and opportunity they are given to get started with to have a good start. I have seen this to be not based on performance. this is by who the person is related to in NetApp executives, if someone is hired or refered through a vp or not.  right off the bat these candidates are set  up to succeed. they are welcomed into the click right away, they are given a break when they mess up and time to get up to speed. where as others will have to beg for training,  resources, contacts and projects to work on regadless of how qualified or not. This can be demoralizing.  The executive teams and leadership is excellent, they try really hard to motivate everyone, to be transparent and provide opportunity for NetApp employees.but that doesn't translate well when it  gets to management and individual level."
good,"Both Employee and consultants are equally motivated by the work atmosphere at NetApp."
good,"OK place to work. Great gym facilities. Flexible work hours and work at home is permitted in my department. Good management in my department. Co-workers are hard working and professional. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with cross functional teams."
good,"Not much to say. You like it or not."
good,"Fast , dynamically paced environment and if you get laid back and become complaisant you are shown the door. Ambience will keep you on the toes , enabling you to think and come up with new ideas and process  which of course will give you a lot of exposure . You need to be full of energy and Never say NO, until you try out"
good,Looks like companies like Isilon are coming with better products & taking their market share. 
good,"There is constant comparison with other companies in the industry and why we are better or deserve better than other companies. Is a bother and goes nowhere. Is ok to compare but not all the time."
good,"NetApp used to be a fun company to work for. There are good team to work with. And working culture is adequate in collaboration, recognizing individual's contribution. All good things  have to come to an end. As storage market become a cut-throat market, watching / cut cost is the number one thing. This dramatically change the culture. A lot of efforts spent in discussing, and there is no clear road map. What NetApp is doing right now is nothing wrong from surviving perspective. But it makes NetApp a place no longer fun to work for."
good,I worked as senior developer that wrote C++/python codes on SAN cluster services and network storage protocols.  Also I provided tools such as python scripts which able to determine validation on updated  device drivers and system software
good,"Overall, NetApp was a great place to work. Management change and re-org's made performing job difficult with new responsibilities. Promoting from within was highly followed"
good,"fast moving ready for change"
good,Great place to learn and grow in a career opportunity.   The management team and workforce are intelligent and forward thinking.   It is a great growth environment where a lot can be learned with plenty of opportunity for those willing to work hard and smart.
good,"Some great people to work with, but many are over-worked and often fear being laid off. Food isn't free but is higher quality than the free food at other tech companies."
good,NetApp is a great place to get your foot in the door for an information technology career. You will learn the basics of running a datacenter.
good,Netapp is a good company to work for. These days the compensation at Netapp is not that good. The one thing for which people stick to Netapp is the work culture and friendly people who are willing to help you.
good,"I was tasked with testing software, The work was fun however I was also assigned as a mentor to way too many interns and found little time for my own work. I was able to write test software but usually only on days when the interns were not around"
good,"Good company, but they work you hard.  Lots of resources.  Not much work/life balance."
good,"There are no typical days, must have a flexible work ethnic and   ability to adapt to various daily challenges.Opportunities abound to grow professionally through training."
good,"Company full of delightfully intelligent people, but with very hard delineations between teams. Teams do not interface well, and creativity suffers as a result."
good,"I learned so much Technically and personal, NetApp gave me Personal and Professional Growth."
good,NetApp is a very demanding and fun company. There are many projects in flight at the same time which requires very flexible individuals.
good,"Experience is the only way to know for yourself what it's like to work here. Like every job, there's ups and downs, good times and bad times. A lot of it has to do with time and chance. The rest is up to you."
good,"What used to be a collaborative and fun place to work has turned into a grinder of metric base productivity.  No longer are they focused on ""is the customer happy"" and ""was the issue solved quickly"", now it is a plethora of metrics to determine pay scales and bonuses.  Layoffs were frequent and one never knew when your end date might be.  Employee perks were reduced as time went on and most events were geared for 1st shift employees and all subsequent shift workers were an afterthought."
good,"I feel confident that we are working to have the best products in the business, and colleagues are high quality and decent to work with. The management may be well-meaning, but the structure seems highly hierarchical and overly compartmental. The management focus is on tasks rather than people. The company purports to highly value innovation, but it seems to be valued only in some hands, not others. I am an individual contributor (non-management, not architect/technical director track) with a great deal of experience. Rather than taking advantage of my experience by allowing my input at higher levels, they tend to simply expect it to mean I should be able to do the same things junior developers can do, but much faster. The result is that I feel under-valued."
good,This firm provided me with a work life balance but still it needs to improve a lot of things. It might have to look into type of redundant work it is doing. not a great management.
good,"When NetApp's stock floundered, and they fell off the Forbes ""Best Places to Work"" list, they seemed to lose interest in employee happiness, and instead focused on stock owners.  They started to value money over employee satisfaction, and the switching of management over and over for a bit didn't help."
good,"Work culture is too relaxed which gives less motivated workers room to slack off leaving others to carry dead weight. "
good,"Typical day depends on the project.Program manager works on project deliverables ,providing status and stakeholder management."
good,"This place has won great place to work award and it truly is."
good,Netapp has a beautiful campus and the break room is phenomenal. I enjoyed the cappucino machines. They really kept me going. Very fun place to work but they had too many layoffs.
good,Support Account Managers have it hard here.  24/7 for large install bases.  Bad work life balance.  Weekend and weekday nights are not you own.  Even to take you child to soccer practice you have to have coverage and arrange it in advance.
good,"Lots of good and telented people at NetApp. Lots of opportunities to learn, value your abiltities, hard work and contribution."
good,The workplace environment is up and coming. Knowledgeable management provides a lot to learn and grow from. Was listed as the Top Business to Work for
good,"The company is in transition.  It used to be a very collaborative culture, very consensus driven.  Very good benefits, and some work/life balance depending on the department / manager.  However, now there are so many layoffs that as soon as everyone recovered from a large layoff, the rumors for the next layoff began.  This changed things into a very negative atmosphere, with everyone huddling and passing around the latest information about the next layoff.  The workload remains a constant but the reduction in force means either additional work or a drop in quality.  Also, people who really had the knowledge were either laid off or left, making things increasingly difficult."
good,"What was once a great company to work for, has been through some hard times, and it shows on the faces of its employees. "
good,"The culture, work life balance, and compensation are very good. Recently the company direction has focused on internal improvements which was needed, but that has removed much needed focus on products and future direction.  The numerous recent layoffs have really hurt morale."
good,Good company with very strong financial foundation. Many great people to work with around you. Many training programs to educate employees on technologies and people skills.
good,"Lots of pinball, arcade & air hockey games in break areas. Beer served on Fridays after 3pm. Stress factor can be high due to customer issues, management expectations. NetApp internal tools & software are frequently broken, under developed & do not work as advertised. As an employee, there is no job security at all."
good,NetApp is not as great as it used to be. I have no idea how it can be ranked as the great company to work for. The people work there did not get enough respecter and reward.
good,NetApp has many great qualities but it is not a stable environment at the moment.  Great pay and benefits but there have been four layoffs in the past 3.5 years and I would guess there are more coming.  Otherwise a great work culture and great people.
good,"I have learned cDOT"
good,"Good management"
good,Management is most of the time unaware of the work quality of their engineers. Some of them they just suck up and voila a good performance and raise
good,The role I worked was full of learning and wonderful experiences. Thoroughly enjoyed working and made some few awesome friends.
good,"NetApp has been like family to me for over 9 years.  The relationships I've formed, both personally and professionally, will last forever.  The exceptional and talented individuals I work with is a testament to the culture of this company.  The skills I've learned by being a part of this wonderful organization will continue to help me grow my career for years to come."
good,Good company with good culture.  Hard to move around internally from a sales perspective.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of handling escalations, updating KB articles and mentoring other support professionals while working via phone, email, and chat. I learned how to work with different disciplines. My co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was juggling learning about other technologies while maintaining a high standard of support for customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to gain knowledge of different technologies and of course Social Friday's."
good,"Very nice people, fun environment, people always willing to help.  I would have stayed much longer if given the chance."
good,Enjoyed working at NetApp.  Worked with great people.  They are very responsive to their employees.
good,"Large company with offices word wide, consistently voted one of the best places in the world to be employed"
good,"The thing that makes the company amazing is the people. This alone helps one be able to overlook the fact that there is very little strong, coordinated, and unified leadership across the organization. Due to a culture of over-collaboration and lack of clear executive sponsorship, critical projects and initiatives typically move forward because of the incredible dedication and efforts of the workforce."
good,Good Environment to work
good,"Buen entorno laboral, gran oportunidad de aprendizaje"
good,Work was busy and challenging.   NetApp's acquired LSI Storage which created multiple development and manufacturing locations.  After NetApp's transferred LSI knowledge/technology majority of remote sites were closed down.
good,Not a lot of communication between the management and employees. Constant restructuring creates an atmosphere of fear and tension.  It seems that the stock price is more important than the employees.
good,"Looking to drive standards around project and program management, so lots of project new to the processes.  Data analytics are hard to drive change around"
good,"I worked in the Netapp as L3 Linux/Unix admin for 2.5 years."
good,Trying to get back on track.  Once a great place to work.  Now just a lot of work and stress.  Hopefully new management will help to get Netapp into the cloud in a stronger way.
good,"Good company to work, they are trying to find their way out through this tough macroeconomic conditions. People are nice to work with and you get to learn a lot. If you communicate well with your manager, then you can create a good work/life balance."
good,I hesitate to write anything at the moment as we just went through a layoff and I lost three of my co-workers. Still not clear on the direction we are taking so I will refrain for the time being.
good,Overall Good Experience. Job Security is a concern. Team is strong technically and glad to work on cutting edge technology.
good,"Worked at NetApp in Wichita for 4 years.  Attrition is highest I've ever seen it, turnover is rampant in cities where there are other options (20-30% annual in Sunnyvale, etc).  I see people walking around as shells of their former selves when we had hopes of getting raises or promotions.  I was told by my manager that even though my performance was above average and that of the level above me, I could not be promoted because I didn't make enough money (seriously).  An engineer has to make within 85% of the next pay grade in order to even be considered for a promotion and since there is a raise and hiring freeze, you can count on being completely stuck where you are.  Management pretends for years (3 managers for me, all 3 did this) that they're going to give you a raise or promoted to the next level because of stellar performance only to let you down with the ""hiring and raise freezes"" because you know that the company is going down the drain.  The managers blow so much smoke up your behind that eventually you become dead inside to the accolades because it ultimately makes zero impact on your wallet.  Walking zombies making money for the megacorp hoping you won't get fired in the next layoffs.  What a great place to work /sarcasm"
good,"Lots of cold calls 70+ per day"
good,"This company used to be innovative, with great culture."
good,NetApp is a great company. I am currently seeking new employment only because my work hours were changed to 6am-2:30pm and my two children were having to get up at 4:30am. This does not make them very happy. Management was wonderful and very eager to help you succeed. The administrative community was very team collaborative and everyone worked as a team.
good,"PPI Corporation is a privately owned company based in Geebung (QLD) and has manufacturing "
good,"My entire tenure at NetApp was highly satisfactory."
good,Good benefits indeed.
good,"Depending on which group you are in, NetApp can be a great or so-so company to work for. The people are dedicated an nice. I found that our group lacked leadership, and the department underwent to many layoffs. However, I'm not there now, and I hear things are better."
good,"NetApp used to consistently be named one of the best places to work; however, their culture is no longer what it once was....especially in marketing. It's political and competitive. It used to feel like employees were all working toward the same goal, but the culture has changed to where people are working to get ahead while keeping others down. It's a sad decline at what was once a great place to work."
good,"Fine place to work.  I am grateful for the opportunity to work at NetApp.  The company has a good work-life culture, but is often hampered by inexperienced management."
good,"NetApp's struggle to redefine itself in the storage market has affected the role of nearly every contributor. The workplace culture is friendly and full of integrity, but as the market changes and the company is forced to adjust, stress is everywhere."
good,Management has been incredibly short-sighted. Their knee-jerk response to bumps in the road always seem to involve layoffs. Continual layoffs mean there aren't enough people to complete the work.
good,"The work environment for my site was generally good; co-workers were skilled and were, for the most part, good people to work with. The company makes a genuine effort to cultivate a team spirit among managers and their subordinates.  An unfortunate downside is the company's recent (i.e., past two years) transformation efforts that have resulted in cyclical lay offs."
good,"I thought I had died and gone to heaven after I got hired with NetApp."
good,"Overall NetApp is a great place to work. Great managers, awesome co-workers. Recently, the upper management has had multiple people changes(including CEO), and now everyone's job security is in question. Market value of the company stock reflects peoples concerns."
good,Very good work-life balance. Known as one of Best places to work for. Just struggling to maintain its reputation. Lot of layoffs in last few years and for next few years to go
good,"NetApp before the layoffs was a fun place.  Great teams, little politics and a lot to learn.  A happy place.  But as hiring slacked off and internal product problems rose, it wasn't a happy place.  It became 60+ hour work weeks with a 2% pay raise come focal time.  It was meeting after meeting, with people caring more about their image than the product."
good,Good people and better process in place. Has nice gym facilities and the projects follow agile. Interesting job profile if you have skills in C/C++ and willing to learn system level programming.
good,"My experience working @ NetApp has been really exciting & encouraging,"
good,"As an Inside Sales Representative in the NetApp's Sales function, you are responsible for supporting sales success by ensuring customers have the products, services, education and support to meet their technology and business needs. You will utilize your customer service and selling skills by building strong relationships with customers over the phone, selling solutions, and keeping them apprised of new product and service introductions. "
good,"SUMMARY:"
good,It's a great company to work for. But there are certain groups which are terribly politicized and need to value the people and work.
good,This is a great place for families.  A lot of flexibility.  The people are great and managers have an open door policy.  Not a lot of advancement in career.
good,Great team work ethic. People work together to help the company move forward. NetApp respects their employees by treating them as people and not machines.
good,"My day may begin at 7am with phone calls from EMEA or APAC on teams where we have projects.  It ends may end 7pm or later...so my typical work week is about 52 hours a week and I'm tired when I get home.  The co-workers are great, and eveyone is working lean.  Not much excess or breathing time here between projects.  Everything is done on a project basis, even the small ones.  The hardest part of the job is the work life balance, and the most enjoyable is being able to work at home for the early morning or late night calls."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"Nice place to work, mostly remote positions. Manage a group of 5 Escalation managers throughout the north east area, including New England. The group manages all escalations of high end network attached storage environments for G50 & G100 customers."
good,"Very good work/life balance. Easy work, good pay. But good people may not be motivated because the work is too easy"
good,"Create databases, manage and maintain them, tuning, backup and recovery."
good,great place to work! It enhances your opportunities and abilities to work with others here
good,Fun and a good place to work. But because of the cloud enterprise storage business is loosing its market and NetApp did not adjust to the change well.
good,NetApp is in a period of major reorganization and transformation. Time will tell if the new leadership can guide the company to a bright future.
good,"I was a contractor at NetApp so I can not speak to the pay range, raises, bonuses, or benefits. The workplace culture, in the organization I was in, changed from when I started, due to a reorganization. When I started it was much more helpful, friendly and relaxed. After the reorganization and new management for me, I was glad my contract came to an end."
good,"As being part of QA team, a typical day would be testing and learning something new in the multiple projects you are involved in. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting hands on with the equipment which releases the pressure that was built up."
good,While working at NetApp the team I worked with was very helpful and allowed me to understand the goals and the direction I needed to go.  I enjoyed my time there
good,"Pretty well run. Operational focus. Good at execution. Not enough permanent positions. Good at collaboration between departments. Some focus on employees like free bagels, coffee and fruit. Silicon Valley culture."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Loading, configuring, and repairing FAS and E-Series equipment. I learned how to setup and install, and configure new equipment. I managed and worked with good people. Hardest part was lack of people to do the job. I'm a techie and love to get my hands on equipment for testing problem fixes or new software."
good,It is a great place to work for. It has good culture and people.
good,"A great company with a close eye on the near term advances.  Churn out every item on your plan and check each box to get your prize. "
good,Great place to work with lot of benefits and management is friendly
good,"Culture of the company is to be risk-averse. This has its own downsides."
good,"There are many perks at NetApp: onsite fitness center, fruit in break rooms on Tuesdays, bagels on Fridays, 2 Fridays a month there is Beer Bash, Electric Vehicle charging stations, etc. "
good,"healthy employer-employee relationship. flexible timings. amazing coworkers, always helpful in work as well as personal life. Team outings was great. great canteen food. agile framework."
good,"Worked at NetApp for over 15 years until removed in 6th consecutive year of the Company restructuring phase.  During my career I was able to excel and accomplish many things to improve process and services and was financally compensated for it.  So while adding real value as others who were let go, improving the Company we with the accompolishements were let go.  This out a very sour atmosphere on the employees.  IMO we should have had an option to cut our salary to stay and continue adding value.  I also think the insider trades by the past and current Executves over the years have been paid way too much in stock for a Company struggling with performance goals and market share.  Not a place you think you can retire at."
good,NetApp is an enjoyable place to work.   They have identified key areas and are investing to succeed in those areas.  The culture is one that promotes collaboration and generally treats people well.
good,good to work for - highly dependent on which group you land in. Company culture is a bit dyslexic right now but this is to be expected given the number of layoffs and leadership changes that have taken place at NetApp over the last 4 years. Company tends to focus on shorter term planning which opens it up for getting caught off guard and having to scramble when key market shifts and opportunities are overlooked.
good,"Netapp was a great company to work for, but after several transitions and reductions, job security is down and opportunities for advancement are slim, as any jobs are eliminated or get eliminated when someone vacates it. Gone is the slogan Great Place to Work and we no longer have Great Place to Work days. In America, we no longer participate in the Great Place to Work Survey and they have stopped employee surveys that measure employee satisfaction"

good,i love this place great pay great people but if your lv1 there under staff and over worked and it could make you want to quit because of the work load
good,"Great company that has grown quickly over past 10 years. In the process of maturing and establishing many controls, policies, and processes that are now necessary given the company size. Leadership still extremely focused on growth and becoming industry leader across all data storage segments."

good,"The company has one of the great work culture across many MNCs and the Values of the Company are upheld by one and all."

good,"Actives include Queue monitoring,Case work and updating, customer communication and resolution. Collaborating with next level support for difficult case resolutions."
good,"Worked remote 100%, Norwin was the agency that placed for Netapp  and Netapp supplied the Technical Assistance to Bank of America. The work was very interesting as we migrated data from EOL filers to new filers. Work could be challenging at times. Management was always there is assistance was needed."
good,"i am work in this company at 10Am to 6Pm it tis the best time for any company."
good,A good work culture but they have too many layoffs.  They do have a lot of training courses and as such it is a good place to learn.  It is probably not good for a long term position.  They tend to lay off their best people and are then surprised at the results.
good,Depends on your Contractor and what they offer you.  Take time to find your vendor and negotiate your rate with the position being offered to you at the company.
good,"NetApp was a great company as even when the market fell in 2008, they chose hire more presales and sales resources (to help grow revenue) vs. layoff field sales resources.  Their strategy has proven out since they have held their own since then."
good,"The office I worked at is their remote location. Team was built up and all engineers and management were good to work with."
good,"Company grew quickly and market changed forcing multiple RIFs in past 6 years which created uncertainty and stress.  Cafeteria was very good.  Type of work was challenging.  Historically considered a great place to work, but has lost ground due to multiple RIFs,"
good,"Fun place to work with Talented and intelligent set of people in collaborative environment. People are Friendly and respectful with each other. "
good,"Great internship programs, with many fun events. Co-workers are really experienced and good. Sometimes managers tend to micromanage the interns."
good,"Awesome culture the people are incredible and the people truly care about each other. Very rare to find in a large company but they have it"
good,"Work life at netapp was good up until its recent downturn over the last few years. Work loads and positions are consolidating greatly, and it seems there is a layoff of some sort ever two quarters. As belts are being tightened, so to is the culture and ""fun"" being stretched and thinned out."
good,I have learned a great deal working for this company. Very friendly co-workers. it is a fast pace job environment so if you cant keep up with deadlines that will be an issue
good,Typical place to work. Used to be better but industry movements has made the company create transformation to help make it healthy once more.
good,NetApp is a great place to work. It has great working culture and employee friendly.NetApp has great benefits for the employees.

good,"Great experience"
good,"Netapp culture is awesome and great place to work."
good,"Great company. Management is accessible, but does not always provide proactive feedback. So you may be surprised at the annual performance evaluation. As long as you are perceived as a good performer you are left alone. But, you will be pushed out very quickly if that is not the case. This company also have a strong commitment to R&D."
good,i couldnt learn much as it was a short term wrk with this team.
good,"I am a hard-working recent college graduate (3.75 GPAout in 4, MSc in IT) from Jahangirnagar University. Throughout my academic career, I was consistently praised as efficient by my professors and peers. While working on academic and extracurricular projects, I developed proven technical, communication, and organizational skills"
good,NetApp will show employee appreciation but will also work you hard.  The work life balance is average and compensation is fair but a bit on the low end.  Every other Friday they do a beer bash.
good,Had a good experience working for NetApp. Got various opportunists to learn and enhance my skill set. Got good support and encouragement from coworkers and leads.
good,I enjoy and love working at NetApp. Work on cutting-edge technology and fast-paced environment. So many fun activities at times. Great people to work with and cooperative environment.
good,"Have flexible work hours policy"
good,"Understood the essential parts of the process where we have apply our knowledge on the process for a better result"
good,"A normal workload consists of 10 to 12+ cases that must be researched and resolved as quickly as possible.  At the same time, you must field calls from customers and work their cases.  Very little downtime to enjoy the stress-relieving benefits like the gym, ping pong tables or video games."
good,Overall great company to work: Good balance of life and work: It was great meeting new people/clients and help them with their challenges: Too much change in Management
good,"NetApp has a forward plan that is communicates to it's employees. And it's actually taking the steps openly to make these changes. The new management team from the CEO down are very competent and honest about what is needed to be done and what is at stake if we are not successful in this transition. Expectations are clearly laid out for staff on what they need change and focus on for all of us to all be successful."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at NetApp. I left because I felt insecure about my job. They had multiple lay offs and I needed more job security. Great people, good work-life balance."
good,"NetApp is a great company to work with. Just planning to change due to some reasons related to career and job security."
good,"Great place to work with co-workers.  Management heavy and to many approvals in their processes.  Job Security, like all companies lately, is not a good feeling since lay offs occur twice a year."
good,"Provides a great work/life balance. Co-workers truly cherish the values of fairness, respect, trust. You get to learn different technologies very quickly."
good,Top heavy and not enough Indians. Love the people that I work with but the leadership lacks motivation and clear outlook for the future.
good,"For many years, NetApp has been a multi-national Great Place to Work.  The culture remains great and people want to make a difference.  Smart and creative people that embody the spirit of ONE TEAM."
good,Management was supportive by offering opportunities for training.  The Field Support Team was very close knit and supportive at any time of day.
good,"it is a good company. the leadership is great, and most leaders are very personable.  i work in the sales enablement team, and are able to meet executives in the monthly New Hire Fast Track workshop. A lot of great people are in NetApp."
good,Awesome Silicon Valley company that has for years lead with a team culture. I believe the new CEO will make the correct course adjustments for the company to return to past glory.
good,"Great place to work, enjoyed working with NetApp."
good,This was working directly with the IT department who knew their work. Refreshing to be able to work with customer who knew how to do the needed required actions.
good,"Great job and place to work depending on your manager. "
good,"The people aren't just co-workers, they can double as friends and family.  The corporate culture, although on average good, can sometimes induce burnout with very lumpy work, or bouncing between large hiring sprees and then subsequent layoffs."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job there is working in very strong agile team with smart and friendly people."
good,- Flex Time

good,"I worked with NetApp for over 10 years and learned so much regarding both SAN and NAS along with the OnTap Operating system.  As a Senior engineer, I would Audit cases and help my fellow engineers resolve customer issues."
good,Through hard work I was able to carve out a niche for myself and a way to provide values to our customers.  The culture has morphed into a large corporate culture in the last few years
good,"Nice Office and Cafeteria"
good,Great place to work. Empowering and promotes self gratification. The hardest part of the job is working with people who panic and need assistance getting their equipment fixed. It's hard not to empathize with them. It's rewarding when we can get a customer up and running with little downtime. The culture allows the employee to Think outside the box and form many avenues to provide the customer with a great support experience.
good,"Great boss, let me run with it but held me accountable.  Underwent RIFs while I was there.  Lots of good people let go.  In office benefits - cafeteria, gym"
good,"Worked in a great small project management team."
good,Fast passed environment that is fun to work and learn in. Gives you a sense of direction the IT industry is headed as well as leveraging some of the newer technologies on a day to day basis.
good,"Product Base Company if you are ready to  learn then you have lot to learn."
good,"good work life balance, nice people"
good,"Unfortunately, the storage industry is being commoditized and thus it is very hard to maintain a competitive advantage.  NetApp will need to figure out how to differentiate using software."
good,"Management encouraged your creativity and your suggestions for improvements.  No sure what the environment is now  Little bit of politics.  I was able to develop an on-boarding and off-boarding process for the dept. along with having the opportunity to analyze information and create reports etc. that were relevant to the organization.  I had the opportunity to manage my departments moves, onboarding set ups etc RE: seat assignment, I tried to keep the folks that were onboarding that were were working on specific projects with other folks together with those other folks."
good,"Good Workplace to work for."
good,"Work atmosphere is amazing, nice leaders nice break rooms clean bathrooms and great place to start your technology related career."
good,"While I loved the technology, there was a lot of layoffs that occurred during my time there. I do believe that their message around Hybrid clouds is heading in the right direction."
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with and all of the benefits. The work is challenging, and interesting. The technology is quite interesting and in today's world, there's always need for more storage."
good,"The organization at the time I was there, did a great job of educating the home office employees to the realities of the field.  We were always reminded of what was going on in the front lines of the business, so that we could better support."
good,Great place to work and got good learning opportunity. All employees are helpful. Most important is flexible timings of the office.
good,The company is very progressive and recognizes the stresses of technical support. Unfortunately the management structure is very fluid and inconsistent and responses to market pressures are reactionary and poorly executed
good,It is a great place to work. There are many great internal training programs. The work environment is very laid back. Only down side is there are way to many lay offs.
good,"It was the best job ever. "
good,Netapp is a great place work the culture was unlike any other I've experienced. The ability to work across teams and geography's was the most fluid I've seen.  They belief they put in their associates to accomplish team and personal goals was amazing.
good,"it's a really nice company to work with, many talented engineers and hard-working guys. However, a little too much process overheads, meetings, which slows every thing down."
good,"nice place to work, nice office and teammate. Now the company is under transformation, I hope it can continue to seccuss"
good,"Reactive and intense. Fighting the challenges of a tough market. Trying to be a leader in a challenged industry and remain a great place to work is tough, keeping people is not a strong suit in the last 4 years."
good,"A lot of leaning,Good product but bad management ,really amazing people around.Pool of talent,chance to work on really good features ,good salary and work life balance"
good,Company has a great work culture. Work life balance is good. But the company is stuck with outdated technology and future is bleak..
good,NetApp is a good company with a very good culture.  Very flexible work from home policy.  Very supportive.  I've enjoyed working here for the last four years.
good,"One of the best On-boarding program for the New College Grads and New Hire Engineers in the whole industry. Also, frequent communications with the employees. At some levels, the company has demonstrated lack and poor execution."
good,"My experience with NetApp has been great.  The people are the heart of the company and really make coming to work enjoyable.  Although with so many people there, it can sometimes feel like you work in a silo with just your direct team.  Benefits and Volunteering are awesome."
good,"In my 3 years working here I have seen a layoff and change of direction each year.  we keep getting told it will not impact or affect us and then get blindsided by mass layoffs."
good,"I've learned the ins and out of Sales Operations while working these past 7 years at NetApp.  Like any big company, there are wonderful managers and others that need more coaching and training.  The hardest part of the job would be filling in when positions are not back filled and taking on the work load for 2-3 people.  What I enjoyed most about working at NetApp were the many fantastic connections I made and many people I have gained so much Sales Operations knowledge from."
good,Working for NetApp has been great. The people all work as a team and the management is very open with everyone. My work to life balance has been very good which makes working for NetApp a great convenience.
good,"netapp is a great company to work for with a great atmosphere. everyone is friendly and the office is comforting. lots of event, good benefits, good pay and good experience."

good,"I was ultimately in charge of  the NetCache product for ISPs and enterprises, working with the sales team and building network architectures over IP in the Internet/intranet environments."
good,"Since I worked for Convergys while working for NetApp this review deals more with Convergys and not NetApp directly. I was a contract worked for NetApp, at a Convergys site. Convergys is a call-center oriented place which had a hard time making adjustments for the difference between what we were expected to do as a service center and their call center environment. We were on the phone with customers at times for more than an hour doing troubleshooting, or collecting information to be used for extensive troubleshooting of issues customers had encountered. The people were great and our management was very supportive. These were the best parts of this job. Expectations were high and we needed to do our jobs with diligence and care, keeping in mind the expectations of our customers. The hardest part of the job was establishing the broad base of experience needed to deal with the large variety of issues that we were confronted with by customers. This takes time and experience. The other hardest part was balancing existing work with new work constantly coming in over the phone and from our dispatch system, causing occasional frustrations. I was one of the trainers for many of the engineers who were still working at this site when our job ended. A typical day included a review of the issues assigned to you at the beginning of the day and quickly reviewing your email messages. Then you were expected to login to the telephone system for incoming calls and work on existing issues between incoming calls, and to make progress on each issue or ""case"" while taking new ones over the telephone."
good,I like to work for  NetApp because there is no limit for challenge. Work life balance is very good. Management value culture thrive for innovation.
good,"NetApp promotes a healthy work-life balance, including Ping-Pong tables, arcade games, and free coffee.  They allow flexibility depending on your manager, which is wonderful.  However, it is so large that creativity is often stifled, and there are politics that enter the scenario."
good,Very good company culture. Executive Management is well perceived. I enjoyed the experience. The stock price has settled out at this point. Overall a good experience.
good,"Smart and goal driving people, fast pacing , technology innovator, open minded management. Some freedom to execute without too much complexity. Some politics at the mid level management."
good,Really enjoy working at NetApp.  They provide you the ability to work autonomously as well as encourage collaboration between cross functional groups.
good,"There are many opportunities for diverse projects to develop your skills. Leaders are approachable and there is good work life balance. The medical benefits, on site amenities and company values are very good."
good,"Process oriented"
good,"NetApp is a good place to work.  Being on the top list of best places to work in days past, it struggles to keep that status, but tries.  NetApp continues to add new products and services to be relevant in their dynamic storage/software marketplace."
good,NetApp is a great place to work. The people I've worked with are great on and off the job. Executive leadership is in tune with industry trends and is not afraid to make the tough decisions. The technology is industry leading.
good,"I have learned a lot since I joined NetApp."
good,Management from top was incredible to work WITH not for.  The concept of MyTeam and I matter was always brought out ... profits follow happy customers and NetApp created many happy customers
good,"The culture at NetApp is great and the people working there truly make it a great place to work.  The company provides several perks for their employees including: afternoon snacks on Mondays, Fruit on Wednesday mornings, bagel on Fridays, onsite gym, basketball court, putting green, ping pong tables etc."
good,"As mentioned in my summary (and I'm sure the reviews of many others), the culture at NetApp is generally very good: Friendly, supportive, and respectful of personal lives. It can be a struggle to progress to in your career though, partially because of the workforce contraction during the companies transformation, but also partially because of management culture."
good,Great place to work. The only thing I have to say about the company is executive management is not transparent as they say they are. Communication is not all that great.
good,"NetApp has a bright future. It is difficult though to work outside of the corporate hdqtr environment."
good,It was a pleasure to work with them. good environment. good team. big team and it team was so helpful. creative team. commute was good. learned a lot here
good,"I worked for NetApp for 5 years.  When I first go there it was one of the top 10 places to work for. But, unfortunately, like so many tech companies, they were not able to keep up with changing times and fell behind. Now, they don't even participate in the Top Companies to Work for Survey, because they know they won't rate very high. The reason? They are ""restructuring the company."" (i.e. laying people off left and right)."
good,"Very employee-friendly, great culture, good facilities at workplace."
good,The environment is great for learning new Cyber Security products.  The teams are great to work with and to keep moving the ball forward.  Many global projects.
good,"There is a great work life balance is what you get when you are woking with netapp as well as a respect for work you do"

good,Though a good place to work but there are lot of scope for improvements. Company is progressing towards maintaining a good and healthy workplace. Company policies quite good and employee friendly.
good,"It is a great company to work for and settle in long term. Free beer every Friday and subsidized food, are some of the perks."
good,Great during growth periods.  Less fun since the cutbacks began.  Easy to engage with management team.  Lots of smart people to work with.
good,"NetApp is a good company, but in a bad spot. It will be interesting to see how the company proceeds within the next few years."
good,"NetApp is a great place to work because of the people. There isn't a sense of competition and animosity like you would find in other corporate environments. You will find that everyone is respectful and will really try and help you. There is also a respect for work life balance."
good,"Worked in a emerging products team that was experimental and with economic indicators it made for an easy cut for management. We were only 15 people covering the globe as an overlay. We would assist account teams on education of how to work with hyper-scaler cloud service providers. It is always funny to see how many companies really don't have an answer to the question of what is your cloud strategy. That many times was my job to educate on what AWS, Azure, Google, and Softlayer could do."
good,"Project is OK"
good,"Good place, good people apart from management culture of almost annual layoffs. Disappointing that somewhere that claims to be so different is actually just the same."
good,"Troubleshooting  OS and storage related issues."
good,"NetApp is a great place to work, but make sure you start on the right side of the tracks. Starting out in support is a great place to gain exposure, industry insight and familiarity with products but it is never a wise long term career choice."
good,"Challenging overseas Accounts Payable"
good,I was given a great chance to learn new things and go to school in the process.  This company treats their people with respect and dignity.
good,"NetApp has well-balanced job with your life. The most enjoyable part for me is the nice colleagues around me, they are willing to offer help when you encounter some issues at work."
good,relaxed environment...sometime feel like unstructured and complex.
good,create innovative solutions and software products alongside key partners for cloud-ready data centers.

good,NetApp is a very employee oriented company with great benifits.
good,Got exposure into different field of HR. Was Learning experience every day.
good,"A typical day includes reviewing aged cases for fellow engineers and working my own backlog of technical cases.  While working cases, I research solutions and documentation for clients and relaying this information via phone and email."
good,"technology delivery, support, customer service, communication, applications operations/management, business acumen, planning/organizing, innovation"
good,Management leaves much to be desired. More tools and resources are need for employees.

good,Very nice place to work!! Opportunities for training were great! Management was fair. Diverse work place! Most enjoyable part of the job was the Networking!
good,"NetApp is a great place to work. For company their size, it does not have the politics you find at other companies their size. Great work/live balance. Very collaborative environment. The only comment I have is that their products are not leading edge. That is most likely caused by the market they are in."
good,"Good work life balance, free gym but need to pay for lunch. The taste is not good. Technical stack is not very new and the storage industry is very stable."
good,"Best place to work "
good,NetApp is s company that is driven by the Sales organization and the Sales organization.  Sales make up 90% to 95% of the companies revenue. It is a great place to work but drastic changes to Professional Services over the past three years has been volatile and made working as a Professional Services manager difficult.

good,"Lots of changes on management level"
good,"This is a fast paced, high stressed, details demanding work. Enterprise customer service skills are premium here. The availability of higher level collaboration is very good. Much of this training is on the job since the product is proprietary. You need to be able to assimilate knowledge quickly and retain."

good,Work life balance is good but not many opportunities to move up the ladder. Good work culture. The best part of the job was my seniors who were very supportive and encouraging
good,"I worked at the company that built storage systems. Enjoyed the work and mostly the people. NetApp bought us 3 years ago, and I'm not sure the senior management had any idea how to run our organization. They made a lot of changes that only time will tell if they were good or bad, but in the short term, made work a lot harder for the people not laid off."

good,"NetApp is a great place to work. People are excited to be there and take pride in their work. The leadership team is also very transparent, so you know how YOU are contributing to the bottom line. This is the first company I have worked for that I had clear sight of that"
good,"NetApp has a great culture with regard to the employees.  Under the current CEO they have developed a very good strategy in the industry to support on prem, public, private, and hybrid cloud solutions.  The biggest drawback is marketing at NetApp.  The story is not marketed very well through the marketing teams.  They continue to focus on pinpoint products instead of the overall story in the outreach marketing programs.  I believe this is getting better, and they have 1 of the best stories in the industry.  I have enjoyed my time at NetApp."
good,"Solid company with very bright and talented people. Company is innovative, and seems to be well-positioned for future. Culture is a little dull, and not much youth at the company. Not much room for people will limited experience."
good,"Flexible work schedule, with work-from-home option, makes getting the work completed around personal schedules. Cutting budgets also cuts out training and travel. Good company to work for and some great people to work with."
good,"NetApp is a great environment to work in.  Everyone is friendly and willing to lend a hand as needed.  There are always opportunities to learn and expand your knowledge."

good,"Job Culture is amazing at NetApp."
good,I liked the work environment and was challenged by the work but the on boarding was very disorganized. It was over all a very good experience and it will definitely be a good thing in my career.
good,"Company cares a lot about the employees and society."
good,"For someone who moved from Puerto Rico to North Carolina, I am very fortunate to receive a position at NetApp. The company is great with welcoming new employees and has a great culture. There are many opportunities to learn and advance, and other employees are more than welcome in providing knowledge and assistance."
good,"Inspiring, motivated, team building. They are big on team building (skill building) and motivate their employees to be future enterprise leaders."
good,"NetApp is a fast paced & challenging environment with a unique environment of team work, personal job growth and dynamic scenarios."
good,"Great Culture and Teamwork Environment"
good,Relaxed environment.  10 weeks of training provided at start.  During the work week the management is great.  The weekend tends to have a lack of guidance on critical issues.  Overall great place to work.

good,NetApp is a great place to work with having good balance of work and life. It is having good culture in office. Co-workers are nice with you. However it depends on the team. But for me it was great.
good,"Overall, NetApp is a great place to work.  The people are friendly and team-oriented.  The onsite gym offers fitness classes and intramural sports.  The benefits are solid - good 401K matching plan and employee stock purchase plans. My biggest complain revolves around the end of year reviews.  Everyone is basically forced to get the average and it's nearly impossible to get a rating that truly reflects the work you've done, no matter how far ""above and beyond"" you went.  Ratings seem to be more of a popularity contest than a true reflection of work performance."
good,They really are a great company to work for. Great morale. Being a support engineer has its pros and cons.
good,"This has been a great place to work, would like to stay currently a contractor and not sure if they will be bringing any FT people on."

good,"Best place to work and learn new technologies like Big Data and its eco system."
good,My typical day was filled with problem analysis and debug and coding fixes for problems that were found.  The management was very responsive and helpful.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when a problem was fixed and the fix was verified.

good,very good company to work with.. the infrastructure was very good.. that's good place to lift our career growth up.
good,"NetApp is fascinating, fast paced and cutting edge. If you get in the right group/team the sky is the limit. If you have the opportunity to work here take it for the experience alone. Unfortunately, like everyplace there are some undesirable people that can destroy a team. Success is all dependent on where you land."
good,Productive environment in a collaborative team-oriented environment. Involved in several projects.
good,"Excellent Training and learning experience at CDW.  Many vendor perks like happy hours, sporting events, contests and ways to make a great living."

good,"Great place to work. "
good,"Excellent Company"
good,"Netapp is an excellent working environment that I have ever worked in my career. Very friendly, talented people"
good,Great leadership
good,Very innovative.
good,"Netapp offers top of the line training, compensation, benefits and excellent career opportunity. All at the cost of job security and poor management. During my career with Netapp in the NYC office, I witnessed even the most senior management get let go on multiple occasions. To be replaced with inexperienced ""suck ups"", who as a consequence of their inability to lead and maintain customer relations, cost the company billions in lost contracts as well as countless hardworking employees underneath them without work. Nothing about Netapp spoke to me as a team effort. As my time with them was plagued with toxic co-workers, politically unacceptable behavior(college level antics/drinking) and overall lacking in human resources(NYC office didn't even have HR). Which in itself reflects the negatives of the business world. Office Politics aside, I love the company's technology, architects and core engineers who were with me in the field and classroom supporting each other every step of the way. But back in that office, it felt like a literal shark tank. Sink or swim is no way to run a Fortune 500 company."
good,Sustaining Engineering and Fault analysis of hardware and/or software systems could be daunting. Often you would find a systemic issue which could put the work in question. The fact that the company had plans and a team dedicated to finding failure trends says they care.
good,They have some senior management that is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.  Otherwise they are very good to work for.  Managers are talented products are good.  They just don't sell all of them.  If it is not FAS it does not get sold.  They need to push the other technologies they purchased.
good,"C'est une bonne entreprise avec beaucoup de croissance."
good,"worked well but due to netapp restructure I was layed off only a few months into the job.  I wish the best for both SBS and NetApp, I only wish I could have made it a long term job."
good,"As a Technical Support Engineer, I work multiple complex cases each day.  Each case presents a new challenge because it is a new environment and a new person on another line.  I have been with NetApp for 8 years and took almost every training course that was offered by NetAppU.  I can work a wide variety of cases. "
good,"Good Job liked a lot worked with hard drives, in assembly and shipping.i would scan units enter info in computer.thanks"
good,I loved working at NetApp it is a great company.  I thought I would be there much longer but Corporate decided to RIF the group I was a part of.  A lot of churn with top management.  The founder recently left.
good,"Netapp has been consistently voted as one of the best places to work in surveys around the world. Netapp provides it's employees with great amenities, such as gyms, delicious cafe's, and a great work life balance."
good,scheduled to come in early meeting with global team. Monday to Friday role with chances to work from home on Fridays. Focused on creating a oncampus life.
good,"Productive and fun place to Work hard, play hard.  "
good,"Loved working with my team, which was the best part of the job for me. Company is turning itself around and has filled most of the executive positions needed for a strong C-suite."
good,A typical day at work consists of taking priority 1 calls from customers who has controllers that are down and not serving any data.  I learned very quickly how to work in a stressful environment.  Management is pretty good.  It is a pretty good atmosphere to work in.  Hardest part of the job is taking a job where the customer is very stressed because they are losing money by the minute and they are looking to me to resolve their issue.  The best part of the day is at the end of the day.  The last hour of the day we are off calls and working on cases in our backlog.
good,Good place to work but no stable employment. People are friendly. You have a choice to work on the projects that you want. Because of the cloud the storage space has been impacted.
good,"Good company to work for.  Diversity working environment and have good data storage products. Enjoy working with others peers and learning alot from other hardware, software, compliance and QA engineers."
good,"Typical day included building walkthroughs to inspect the conditions of the building and grounds.  I learned that there truly are great places for employees to be put first.  My direct manager left much to be desired in regards to leadership. Teamwork left much to be desired, as well.  Hardest part of the job was learning the ""NetApp"" ways, without any guidance whatsoever.  The most enjoyable parts were getting to interact with such a diverse group of people, travelling to a couple of other sites in the US that were top-notch in regards to facility controls and equipment.  Really cool to see the operations portions of the buildings."
good,"Managed Operations Team for the USPS/Federal space. Created and maintained Top Issue Tracker for the global quoting tool, QuoteEdge. Ensured NetApp KPI's are met in the USPS Space. "
good,The work environment at NetApp is very inclusive and the management is approachable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work in a casual work environment. The training opportunities are amazing and better than anywhere else I have worked.

good,Excellent Company to work for but Pre-Sales role just wasnt for me.
good,Approachable senior leaders and collaborative environment.
good,"NetAPP ENCOURAGE KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT by advanced on job training and discount certification programme."

good,"I think NetApp is truly a great place to work. My experience with the company lead me to believe the values are modeled by the executives all the way down to the employees. The culture at NetApp is like no other company. People go above and beyond the status quo to help out a customer or an employee. The philanthropic causes that NetApp encourages employees to participate in makes me love NetApp so much more. My coworkers are truly genuine and friendly people. Even the employees I don't personally know always smile or say when passing by the hall or bathroom. "
good,It wan an amazing experience to work with talents people at NetApp. Very memorable experience.
good,"I have enjoyed it. It has been a positive experience so far. I still am employed here, and have been converted from an intern to a full time employee"

good,"Would like the company culture to be a little more competitive than it is today. Company offers work life balance and as a result sometimes things move slower than my personal liking.  I enjoy working with the teams here due to collaborative nature, and there is no work stress."
good,I enjoyed working there. My team was very intelligent and respectful. The work assignments gave you room to think and be productive. Beer Bash Friday's were a great way to get to know your coworkers.
good,"I have worked for Netapp for 17+ years for them and it's an awesome experienced.  I learned so much working for this company and love the culture there.  Unfortunately, I got layoff since they outsource all their Field Support activities to partners but still love working for Netapp if I have opportunities again."
good,"The sum up of my experience at Netapp was very good.  As one of the most successful companies in the world in storage and software, my time there was overall pleasing.  "

good,"My manager was fantastic to work for. Management very professional "
good,"NetApp's atmosphere is great, it's processes mostly have it's stuff together, and the people are mostly excellent.  They fell on some hard times in the early 2010s, but they're recovering.  They aren't as awesome as they were in their hay day, but they are still in the top 100 places to work in the nation."
good,"Good place to work, nothing to tell apart from this, work environment and  campus is awesome, mainly data center  and maintenence is good, work timings"
good,"Apart from insecure job, Netapp is one of the most employee friendly company. One of the best companies to work with. If they remove their hire and fire policy, i would have worked with netapp forever"
good,I've been working here approximately 10 years and the culture has changed from when I first started working here; however with the growth experienced that is not totally unexpected.  I love working here and I love the job I do.
good,"The company is an awesome place to work at. The amount of work you get depends on the team you are in. There are no fixed timings to come to the office, so as leaving the office. There is no dress code as well. You can get plenty of stuff for eating and drinking. The colleagues are really helpful. Most of the work done here uses C/C++ and the technology is really good."
good,"Great place to work!"
good,"NetApp is a fast paced, ready to turn on a moments notice atmosphere.  The executive leaders have a keen eye for industry changes and drive to keep the company as an industry leader with innovative products.  The best part of working here is my management's confidence in my decisions and abilities.  They allow me to get the job done without micro-managing."

good,"NetApp's mission got lost along the way, but it seems like they have successfully course corrected. Great place to work and great people to work with."
good,"The most enjoyable part about the job was the roll up your sleeves and go.........attitude.  "
good,I really appreciated the team and the collaberative work environment. The entire team gave 100% and we all aided to help the other succeed. I would go back there in a New York minute if it was possible.  Loved the Lattes in the morning.
good,"One of the best organization's to work in! Amazing campus, state of the art facilities, and a really well balanced work / life culture. Growth depends on how far you are willing to push yourself!"
good,"I worked remote for all of my 17+ years at NetApp.  It was a great place to work, with a positive work/life balance.  Working remote as a contract was a great oppotunity, and previously as a field enginner, it provided exposure to many differe customers and environments."
good,"Overall Co-op experience at NetApp is really enriching in many ways. I got a chance to put my skills learnt at college to use in real time development. NetApp had  a very well ""new hire orientation"" that guides a new hire student to go through all the tutorials and take assessments for the first 3 months. Manager and team works closely with students and to help them gain technical knowledge. I've had lot of advantages after working at NetApp as I got exposure professionally."
good,"Excellent company,."
good,"Good Working culture, able to learn a lot."
good,Love the work culture and environment. Very loving helpful co-workers and upper management. The only down side is that the jobs aren't stable at all.

good,"•	Providing technical hardware and software support and troubleshooting for all Netapp FAS controllers also providing support for disk shelf and cabling issues."
good,"Working at Netapp allows the freedom to set your own schedule and work around your life. If you have a plumber coming just work from home and be sure your work is done. The team is supportive and provides the perks one would often wish for. Snacks, beer, games. The co-workers are excellent and always there to help when they can. They've built a great team and Netapp recognizes this by motivating and retaining the tea."
good,The company I worked for was bought by NetApp.  It wasn't NetApp when I worked there.
good,A typical day at work involves teamwork in resolution of enterprise customer NAS and/or SAN environmental issues.
good,"Productive environment, good management, room for growth and development, transparent policies, good work-life balance"
good,NetApp is globally one of the best places to work.  The company culture is one of a kind.  I was humbled to have started my career at such an innovative company.
good,"Even as a contract worker with NetApp the people within different departments I worked with all worked professionally and made me feel like a genuine employee. I got a chance to work within three different departments within a six month contract and not only got to see the technical aspects to the company but the practical sides of the company as well. From working with marketing and seeing the future products and services the company was working on, to Engineering and seeing the infrastructure of different sides of the company at work, I got a sense of just how big and challenging the work at the company really was. My boss and one coworker were both great and gave me all sorts of advice and help to break the ice with the SMEs they had already been working with, but also helped guide me through what their expectations of documentation and tasks I needed to complete for them. I loved the cafeterias on campus within each of the buildings as they offered all sorts of cuisines, and often more just down the campus in a different building. Honestly the hardest part was leaving the job as it was my first big exposure to the high paced and fun atmosphere of the IT/ technical field."
good,"NetApp is an overall great company. I enjoyed my time there, and had a blast getting to know my coworkers. My only suggestion is to be CLEAR when you are hired as to how they are going to train you. Training is weird and you can be thrown to the wolves if you are not careful."
good,"A great opportunity to work on the key component of Digital transformation - DATA. NetApp with its Data Fabric strategy is addressing solution like Data Management and optimization in a hybrid multi-tenant environment. More that just Storage solutions it addresses other key components like - HCI, Converged Infrastructure, and Cloud Integrated Storage."
good,"Work was fun at netapp, I enjoyed the work atmosphere and environment. I was knowledgable in django before, it really improved my skill at it. My boss was very nice and reassuring."
good,"I really enjoyed working at NetApp because of its culture and people. "
good,"Worked at NetApp for 7 years until laid off.  Concern about focus on profitability over having people skills.  At the time they laid me off, they were concentrating efforts in India and employment in the US was suffering."
good,"I can’t say enough good things about the people here. Everything about this company was great, minus the benefits as we are only considered contractors. Other than that, I really enjoyed my job. It can be stressful, yes. But the people and the environment made it all worth it. Everyone is welcoming. I consider the people here to be more like family than coworkers."
good,"Great people, great product.  CRM needs to be better.  Good mix of sales vs technical folks. Culture is fantastic.  Your left to work on your own business."

good,"Very comfortable work environment. People are great, which makes it easy to get up and come to work.  Very flexible with work and personal life.  Great benefits."
good,NetApp was one of the best cultures I have ever had the privileged of being a part of.  It was a work-hard-play-hard environment.  Management and Technical staffs were excellent.
good,"I loved working there because there was no dress code, the managers were mostly hands off, and as long as I got my job done everyone was happy."
good,"Excellent Workplace with good scope for improvement of skills"
good,"i had the best manager !"
good,NetApp is full of fantastic people that work hard and are interested in everyone's progress and success. Product is still easier/better to sell than that compared to competitors.
good,No day is the same. Always look forward to coming in to work. Most enjoyable is watching engineers grow and gain knowledge. Least enjoyable is when a support case has not gone well. Never like to see customers disappointed.
good,Great team members. Offered the ability to work from home and allowed for flexible schedules. Materials provided without question and always available.
good,"Em relação a ambiente, colegas de trabalho, gerencia, excelente!"
good,"I enjoy very much working for NetApp, they treat there employees very well."
good,"very Healthy environment at origination "
good,"At this job I was given full responsibility to work independently to complete the various requested projects. Other directors appreciated my accuracy, responsiveness and engaged me in other projects for their groups. The most challenging part of the job was reviewing hundreds of contracts for hours at a time searching for potential edits. My co-workers were a wonderful group of people who inspired me to learn more in this legal field. The beat part of the job is that I am an avid reader and have an eye for editing. I really enjoyed that aspect."
good,Great place to work with great co-workers. Free fruit provided on Tuesdays and free bagels provided on Fridays. 
good,An amazing place to work.  The Wichita Site is growing and there seems to be a new product coming out all the time.  So I always find myself learning something new.
good,"I really enjoyed working at NetApp and it was great to be able to work from home, thus eliminating morning and/or afternoon drive-time traffic. I would be happy with NetApp again."
good,Supported Linux and Windows environment for a software development firm specializing in the Health Insurance vertical. Talented team of developers and a progressive corporate culture made this a fun place to work.
good,"A place to work, learn and have fun. I have learnt a lot of technical and non technical skills. Technical skills include working with JSON files. As an intern I had some difficulties with adapting to the work environment in the earlier stages, but soon loved going to work everyday because of the collaboration between the team workers. There was a lot of room for creativity."
good,In my 2+ years at NetApp I had the opportunity to be surrounded by intelligent and competent individuals. In my time there I learned a lot and was rewarded with my efforts with bonuses and praise for my hard work. As a Technical Support Engineer II I provided a wide range of support from Storage Encryption to repair of failed volumes. i really enjoyed my time at NetApp.
good,"The people here is extremely friendly and eager to help. The technical depth is great. The projects to those we are exposed requires intellectual depth. Overall, the work culture is excellent here."
good,"Get to work on real projects"
good,"A typical day at work, I wouldn't even consider it being called ""work"". I like to think of NetApp is like another home to me. Increasing knowledge is a daily bonus at NetApp. I've learned so much from configuring a storage array system, to various different internet protocols, and scripting along with knowing how to triage defects in specific software. We have NetApp culture that everyone embraces. Managers, directors, were all people in NetApp. One big great family.The hardest part of the job, is adapting to change quickly and implementing new features to test and incorporate in the software. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to walk around freely, and taking a break when ever you choose to. Playing pool, ping pong , along with all the other Company festivities going on. Another thing I like is the VTO (volunteer time off) where we go and offer services to the Kanas Food Bank or other charitable organizations. Right now I am a software engineer contractor until I receive my Bachelors Degree. Once I receive my degree, I will apply as an engineer for the department I've been growing in. I need a second job only for Saturday's and Sunday's to help with some bills."
good,"Everything about NetApp is good. The people, the policies, the culture, the management. When they say they are the best place to work, they mean it."
good,"Foi a melhor experiência no mercado de trabalho que eu tive. Em termos de gerencia, um ambiente de interação entre os funcionários, comprometimento etc."
good,"NetApp is all about achievement in a tailored environment surrounded by like minded professionals out to win. The company has gone to great lengths to foster an inviting and liberating  environment, encouraging staff to find their own pathways and styles to succeed. The company has enormous self belief, and in turn the employees all respect one another of insiders with skills and knowledge mutually needed to succeed. A manager may not be of higher skill than elsewhere, but in this framework, there is enough precedence and culture supporting a healthy team and individual development not bound by a manager."
good,Great place to work. Great company culture. Very competitive culture. Onsite fitness with regular classes. Onsite cafe with various options of food. Leadership is very intune.
good,NetApp is the Best place to work for any candidate from an intern to any senior role. Employees are given equal responsibilities and the recognition when deserved. I would recommend NetApp to any candidate looking for a job opportunity.
