rating,review
bad,"Employees were treated w little respect, plant manager was very verbal swearing at employees, very toxic environment.mfilthy location, restrooms non working, mice droppings in the office, photos taken and sent to HR nothing done,  outside parking lot lights not wirking, icy walking conditions numerous slips in parking lit.  Plant mamager swore at employees. Threw objects across the room.  Very toxic environment.  Unsafe machinery."
bad,Avon plant is a joke do not go there they tell u 8hrs to get u in the door then they try to make u work 12hrs a day will lie straight to your face they have a very high turn over rate a bunch of lazy managers dope heads don't waist your time please
bad,Run from this company.  Horrible place to work and management is gosh awful.  No advancement and just really bad work place.  The corporate office is in Avon lake ohio.  .
bad,Management was a joke. The work was horrible. Very toxic and super hot in the summer. Very dirty I would not recommend anyone work here. They treat people badly and you are yelled at a lot.
bad,Upper management doesn’t give a hoot about the employees but them selfs. HR is a joke and a lot of back stabbing lack of training and no morals and just everything
bad,it was a difficult place to work fellow employees treated horrible as well mangers didn't care for anyone they would they would have us working in a hot building with a little to no ventaltion at all
bad,"Good luck with having the parts you need to fix the equipment, and the younger guys in maintenance will cut your throat out any chance they get. Not to mention the fact they are stealing everything they get their hands on at the same time. The older guy's in maintenance are rude and very demeaning towards anyone who has a real background in maintenance. My advice is stay far away from this company."
bad,"Spartech wasn't bad, PolyOne shut down the Profitable Division, Kept other Divisions."
bad,"Ran by a loosing team, the equipment is inadequately maintained , always breaking down. The product quality is always recieving customer complaints. Bonuses was not given out this year due to poor product quality and too many customer complaints. This place was a big waste of time to work at. It's filthy."
bad,"O worked at the Pasadena location for 2 weeks,  the pay is extremely low and the work is more of a labor manufacturer type. This isn't operations,  don't know why they call it that"
bad,The absolute worst place to work. Have never worked in a place like polyone all they care about is getting the lbs out the door
bad,All new management took over. Did not want to listen to their employees. Management would lie to you to shut you up. Could not get ahead.  All about safety but go faster. Do more but expect less from management.  You work your butt off and get treated very poorly.
bad,All I have to say is terrible management and HR with no deserving pay worth. No job security at all as they fired me with no notice and while I was on my week vacation with no proof of reasoning!!!
bad,"when polyone took over  the company we lost customers and 30% of our staff was laid off, when business picked up we had to much manditory overtime we always worked a 12 schedule which was fine but we were forced many many times to work 7 dys on and one day off i put in 670 overtime hours alone last year"
bad,"This company has teh worst management team, starting with the plant manager to the human resourses manager. Lack of respect for its employees."
bad,"PolyOne offers great support for employees who are newer to the workforce, but I would not recommend this corporation to anyone who desires a sense of purpose at work. PolyOne is all politics and optics. The management is not helpful and cares little about developing talent. They actually care very little about the people of the organization at all beyond personal cliques. If you need a job, go for it. If you have options don't waste your time here."
bad,"Nothing to say good. Rotating shift , poor management, no one to hold management accountable, safety rules constantly change, expected to change your schedule throughout the year."
bad,Employee had left company on bad turms and was rehired wwhich is against company policy. Within a year employee was promoted and the reason was given to us because they felt they had screwed him in the past. This company does not care for their employees. Had a coworker who has worked there for 3 years running a very profitable machine and keeps getting held back from promotion to machine operator.
bad,"This place is in the process of laying off and terminating employees with 10 years or more of xp.  They are always out of whatever you need to complete your tasks. Right on down to ppe. They are always out of hand soap, and paper towels to wash yourself after a long days work. It honestly felt like this place was shutting down or on the verge of shutting down. "
bad,"Where to start? Well if you enjoy working with ignorant arrogant people who mostly don't care about you or your well-being, faltie equipment, dangerous conditions, and continuously decreasing aid then this is the job for you. If you don't want to battle the growing fondness of the sweet release of death don't work here."
bad,Not a people work place. Was bought out and the new management threw the older employees to the curb . Would wish this on anyone
bad,"Benefits were great but poor job security. Didn't always get breaks, tell you at last minute you had to work over 4 hours. Co-workers on edge as well as management"
bad,"Management is terrible. I've never worked at a place with s top heavy management staff that is the apitomy of lazy, incompetent and lack respect and appreciation  for their workers. Glad to get out of this place."
bad,Too much of a buddy system. Management is not qualified for the positions. A schedule was never correct and could not rely on a consistent schedule. Was employed there little more than 2 years and my hours changed 10 times.
bad,Was a hopperfiller wich included of driving forklift to warehouse and getting material for mixing.  Setting machine to proper setting for mixing.  Made sure machine didnt run out of material
bad,"polyone s culture sucks they are very tolerant of racists at this particular location , and it sucks,because the company could so very very much more."
bad,"Be real careful going here. The culture is bad and management/leadership is terrible. There is no advancement possible, even though they try and tell you there is. Bad would be a compliment for leadership. They do not know how to manage...only interested in themselves. Over 20 people have come and gone in my time there. Management always says that the employee has the problem and there is a reason they are gone and does not see that the poor, abusive culture that leadership encourages is a problem. I left because I was tired on the rude, unethical treatment by management and the culture they foster. A couple of other employees by into this and it becomes a watch your back place. I am much healthier since I left as are others who did the same. This place will take everything from you if you let them.....don't bother with HR as they are worse than leadership."
bad,"Long hours and no pay for performance. New hires that do 1/4 of the work you do,  make the same rate as you. I was hired in and told a little overtime and seldom work Saturdays, that turned into 12 hours a day and maybe 1 saturday off a month.  If you didnt volunteer to work 12 hours they forced you to stay over or come in early. Very , Very short staffed to the point of operating under unsafe conditions. There were times it was just myself and 2 other employees to work a whole shift on Saturday."
bad,"It was welcoming at first when you are first introduced to your neighbors in your cubicles. Then work life begins and it's you in your cubicle, work on the computer you are given for the tasks you had to complete, and that was it."
bad,I enjoyed working with Polyone in the beginning. The training was not GOOD AT ALL NEEDS IMPROVEMENT BAD. I eventually caught on with good team player co-workers. The upper management DO NOT RESPECT THE  Supervisor at ALL. UNLESS THEY ARE LIKED PICK AND CHOSE. Co-workers scared to speak up. They will let you go for NO REASON OR IF A SUPERVISOR doesn't like you being honest about work condition. This company has a very HIGH TURN OVER.
bad,"Management and H.R. do not handle issues. No advancement. This site is never fully staffed, people quit and get fired all the time. Poor training of employees. No team work between 1st and 2nd shift. A very stressful place to work"
bad,Slave culture.. Do more for less. Hot AF in the summer. Particulate matter everywhere. Exposure to heavy metals lead and chromium6 not mention the hydrocarbon fumes from the melting of pigments. Forced overtime due to supervisors literally sleeping on the job.
bad,This place was run by a racist good ole boys club. Plastic is a dirty industry dead end job with a 26 year old plant manager that doesn't know people only vauge chemistry
bad,"No job security, only strategy for reducing cost is reducing jobs. Remaining people expected to work like dogs. Management wastes 4 hours a day in meetings to come out and say ""we"" need to work harder to get that bonus. Never see upper management on the weekends though so I guess we doesn't include them."
bad,Not much overtime and no control of it. Production rules. Very little training. Safety is lacking in areas seems to be like weekly occurence of injuries.
bad,Very fast pace .
bad,"The quality dept was often short staffed, forcing overtime. Raises were given every 18 months, with a 3 percent maximum. Management is hands off to productions need for extra personnel.  Training is inadequate for the job. Constant off hours phone calls and texts to do extra overtime. Basic lack of respect from management."
bad,Starts out well with promises and encouragement but quickly erodes. Leadership is a joke. They push only what did we get done today? All of the leadership is very inexperienced or young. I was moved from one area to another then micromanaged by a new lead person with little to no experience. HR shows up once or twice a month and is useless to talk to. Director level is in another state and shows up once every other month. Working with the older people is good...they have a grasp on reality. Work here only if you need money.
bad,"no promotions within, "
bad,(Birmingham Al )They do not care about there employees at all. They leave air conditioners for the break rooms broke. Do not do reviews in a fair or timely manner. They will randomly mandate 12 hour shift 6 days a week with only 48 hours notice. They claim they are all about safety but will not invest money into things the employees see as safety hazards when they ask use. Pay scale is completely unclear and bias with temps many times making more than current employees. Heath insurance thee is a joke and not work having.
bad,PolyOne is a company that does not take the time to get to know you. It works very much like a corporation. Its cut throat and honestly is not a great sales environment
bad,"The place doesn't know what work life balance is.  They are under staffed for peak season production and will not move above their minimum staffing ""in case demand goes down"". You'll be required to work 60+ hours a week from May-October.  Other weeks are bad as well and with little notice."
bad,I put 21 years in this company. A new management crew took over and within six months they fired me and gave me no severance. The upper management have no idea what they are doing. I have nothing good to say about the management. But I enjoyed the imidiate people I worked with and the fast pace of the job.
bad,"It was a good company when it was GLS,"
bad,I operate single and twin screw extrusion. I also work in the warehouse. I do monthly inventory and load and unload trucks. I load and unload railcars. The co-works are ok. Management there is no stability at this facility. I injoy the most is working on the machines it gives me the opportunity to learn the in and out of the machines.
bad,"If you work in the front corporate office you are most likely going to be OK. The workers in the plants are a whole different ballgame. If you can't work a rotating shift- this place is not for you! You are required to rotate every single week from 1st, 2nd, 3rd. If you don't have kids or family obligations this would not be bad but if you do you will not last. It is extremely hard on your body to change from week to week and they never have enough staff to help because they simply can't keep guys on the floor due to these rotating shifts. If they would go to at the very least a 2 week rotation on a shift, people would stay longer and be able to adjust. "
bad,"*  Very Poor Management"
bad,"Typical day at work is about a 8 to 10 hours shifts making some of the most amazing colors for the world to use is actual exciting for me."
bad,"While Polyone is an excellent and well run multi-national corporation, the Wilflex division is another story.  Do yourself a favor and go onto linkedin and find the past three plant managers, marketing managers, quality, etc., that have worked there over the past 5-6 years and ask them what their experience was like.  Be very careful, they will promise you the moon.  Do your homework before committing!  I can't say more than that."
bad,They don’t listen to employees lots of over time 700-1000 hours a year swing shift even if you work sundays they don’t care about your life only production so if I want a company that really cares this isn’t it
bad,"Polyone Corporation is amazing. The site in Kennesaw is a different story. I wish someone had given me this information prior to me working there. The environment is extremely toxic. Polyone Corporation Prides itself on being a great place to work and even has all of its employees complete a survey that is gone over by the president himself with a fine-tooth comb. Polyone also Prides itself on being a diverse, inclusive, safe and supportive environment. No one is minding the store in Kennesaw as this is not the case at this location. Management does not follow the same mantra as long as the company is making money. Human Resources is non-existent. If you are ethical, prideful, hard working and respect yourself as a professional; run don't walk from Speciality Inks in Kennesaw Georgia. If you have an opportunity to work at any other location especially the corporate office in Avon Lake please consider it a great one."
bad,"Landed at corp office AP after my company was bought out.  Little training, catty co-workers and mgmt. that cared more about what committees he could join than actual training or working with his employees"
bad,"worked through Manpower, no benefits and stability, company was a good company if able to work for them only."
bad,"Good job with good coworkers. Very poor management, overall, which is why they are losing workers, quickly. Work force reductions.  Jobs going to other plants."
bad,Polyone was a great place to worked because they offert good salary and benefits
good,"The company does have very good health benefits.  It also has a very good pay scale for the area.  Recently, the stress levels have grown greatly."
good,I have nothing prestigious to say about my short tenure with this company. My temporary employment came from their acquisition of another company of which I was devoted to.
good,Productive place of employment. Needs additional structure for guidance. Management needs to be more structured. All coworkers are hardworkers.
good,My position required reviewing issues that came up when Accounts Payable entries did not match with Purchase Orders and discrepancies with suppliers and plants existed. I learned how to work with a variety of levels of management and be diplomatic in a variety of situations.I supervised a team of processors who were very competitive and strived to do a good job and I enjoyed their commitment to the task at hand. The hardest part of the job was making everyone happy since often there were discrepancies that had to be resolved after the products delivered. The production times and cost issues were the most sensitive factors that created tension and stress between our corporation and our suppliers and that had to be eliminated or reduced as much as possible by me and my team.  This was also the most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job since I was very good at it so our plant managers and suppliers were usually happy and I was well liked.
good,"no advancement, management unfair, HR non responsive to issues. no one listens to issues or does anything to make changes. upper management so detached from every day functions"
good,"ligne d'extrusion en secteur colorant plastic,réglage machine etc voir détail sur cv"
good,"Polyone Corporation in Dyersburg is a good place to work but beware of the poor management and minimal advancement opportunities. Work environment depends on which production line you are assigned to, some are very fast paced and messy jobs while others are very minimal effort, then you have those in between. Entry level employment offers an optimistic possibility of advancement but once you meet all qualifications your chances for advancement stop, unless you are looking for a management position which are rare and very cut throat positions. The upper management team is very closed off to the rest of the production team and do not communicate with facility often or honestly."
good,"Interesting company which was still trying to figure its next stage."
good,"Runing leather products for Honda Car Company,Checking product to make sure it was the right quality, Keeping the heat control check for the fabric that we used, "
good,"I worked as an Electrical Maintenance Technician for about a year at PolyOne. A typical day there included preventitave maintenance activities and repairs on big machinery, along with a fair share of troubleshooting. To sum up my time there I will say that if it were not for the horrible management staff employed there, I would likely still be happily working there. I encountered much of that ""old school"" mentality with more than a few members on the management crew, which lended itself to a lot of unnecessary drama, coupled with a generous amount of racism. The job itself was perfectly fine, it was some of the people there that really made it a pain."
good,My day will consist of measuring and testing the reliability of product from the production floor. Collecting and analyzing data.I learned how to use and calibrate a variety of measuring equipment.Management was upbeat and positive.Associates work well as a team.The hardest part of my job is multiple change overs.I enjoyed collecting and analyzing data.
good,Good people with a good company but management cant seem to get their finger on what the customers need. They change our schedule every 90 days. We have worked every configuration imaginable and they still haven't figured out what's going on.
good,It is a good starting point for coming into the plastics industry. But there is very little room to grow or advance. The company need to offer a better chance for advancement. Merit raises are good but advancement is at a stand still. it also has an ever changing requirements. Nothing set in stone. But there are good people out here to work for who are glad to share their knowledge with all who ask. I have spent a good ten years here and have learned much but there is nothing for growth.
good,The job is not bad but some people work harder than others management does nothing to fix the problem. I want a job that that I can advance and prosper .
good,"12 hour shifts that are rotating, not always set on the same schedule though.. its a customer driven plant so work loads may vary. there are alot of hard working people at the facility, most jobs are not overwelhming, tho a person may get dirty from time to time depending on the work needing to be done."
good,Location  was acquired  May 2013 plant is now closing.   Can't fault PolyOne these things happen with mergers.
good,Alright place to work.   This is all I wish to say.  This review requires a minimum of 150 characters.  So I will say that it is a union facility and it being a older structured union the employees will stick together good or bad.
good,The employees are great to be around.  The management staffing is very poor.  They don't take care of their employee's.  I wouldn't refer anyone to apply their.
good,The safety culture here is not positive. They still need to work in it .as well manage orders for customers. The atmosphere was not pleasant and the is too much favoritism with the senior employees. Temps are not trained properly
good,"The people are great. The job is demanding.  I was involved in a lot of the HR daily activities including recruiting/onboarding, employee relations, benefits and helping in other areas as needed."
good,"Good Opportunities to learn and utilize skills"
good,"Was a great place to work.  However, management was not oriented to training and discipline.   The technical staff just stayed in trouble with the employees because none of them had management training....only technical training..   Because of a cut back, I was placed on lay-off status,  along with many other employees."
good,Managers need more training on how to delegate work to their employees and help them grow. A lot of people ask for more work or the opportunity to showcase their skills but are not given the opportunity unless they go through one of PolyOne's development programs. There's a lot of hard working/highly skilled individuals working at PolyOne who are over looked because they do not have a MBA or aren't playing the corporate game. It's frustrating for the individuals who want to actually make a positive impact at work.
good,"Like all places of business we had to work. we had the few that didn't want to work ,and a few that complained about the work and did it anyway. We had the rotating DOW work shift so every week you were changing work schedules. We used radios to communicate and of course there were the few that didn't carry their radios. Safety classes/ fire extinguishers/1ST aid classes were always being scheduled every mo. It isn't a bad company to work for. YOU'LL NEED A TWIC CARD TO GET IN THE PLANT."
good,"Hot work but better than most plastics plants. Plant level leadership was easy to talk to but shift level leadership is lacking in some shifts. Seems to have a hard time keeping people in due to changes in company policy for production level staff. Older staff less helpful in general but not always. Overall really enjoyed the job but left because of multiple ""near-miss"" incidents that could had easily been corrected if shift level leadership came out of the office or was as concerned with safety as higher ups."
good,When I worked there it seemed like upper managements goal was to pay everyone except themselves as little money as possible. As plant operator we were told we were support staff for the material handling department.
good,"Competitive pay, safe environment.  Highly dynamic environment within reason.  Work can involve heat and somewhat heavy lifting, but overall environment is generally comfortable and relaxed.  Would return if I got a callback."
good,"interesting people, interesting tech, interesting problems/projects, never the same day twice,  plenty of room for growth and advancement."
good,Good stable company. Opportunity to learn thru furthering your education.  The respect and promotions are based off your education.   If you don’t have a higher education but experience they hire you but you don’t get promoted due to no degree.  However you can have a college degree and 0 experience and get hired to be a manager over the experienced. P1 lost a lot of knowledgeable people
good,"No comment.  "
good,Fast passed work place with yearly cost of living raises. Really hot during summer mouths and working conditions is not for everyone. When production is high there is more enough overtime.
good,"Began working with a Contractor and was told several times from my Supervisor at PolyOne that I would be hired and please be patient."
good,Very repetitious work in hot buildings around chemical fumes all day. Fiberglass particles everywhere. Too many rules and the lunch/breaks are too short
good,"fast paced job,attention to detail essential,must be able to plan out the work day in order to complete tasks,must be able to overcome any problems which arise"
good,"Travail correct mais physique, equipe réactive et chef au top"
good,"chemical drums were poorly labeled or mislabeled. The drum rack was always leaking, no intention to fix the leak, we was told to use rags,some of the chemicals actually caused contact burns-due to improper PPE being provided."
good,You come in and see what line your working whether or not you are experienced on that machine or not. Training is scarce. If you need to learn something you either need to figure it out yourself or hope another operator has time to assist you. Even after operating for 4 years there is still plenty to learn. The pay is okay for what you do but the benefits are expensive. They rarely do things for their employees. No Christmas parties or events like that.
good,It was a really long time.  The location I worked at closed and products were produced from another location instead.   So any review I give would be moot.
good,This company has a 12 hour shift that rotates every 1.5 months. Undesireable for families who require a stable schedule but perfect for anyone who wants to make good money with alot of overtime available most of the yr.
good,"I love working for the company until we got bought out, they didn't really know how the business in our division operates.  Great and advanced ERP System and modern equipment.  Corporate spent millions of dollars in Capital projects."
good,"A typical day at my job includes,  arriving to work on time, putting on my safety gear and going to my work station.  The most important thing that I learned from my employer was the importance of safety procedures. I had no problems with my co-workers or company management.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I had one."
good,"dangerously dusty. very physical and very understaffed. equipment is outdated and inefficient. pay for the area is ok, but not good compared a real wage living standard. they have a very effective safety manager."
good,I worked for 20 years at this company.  There was no growth.  Did not show willingness to promote people.  Management was difficult because they played favoritism.
good,"compétences variées et pointues : formulation - transformation - suivi clients"
good,Nice environment and good people work there.  Not enough incentives are offered.  Need a better health care plan.  Overall good place to work.
good,I enjoyed the 12 hour rotating shifts.. Allowed for ample time off for family.  Didn't enjoy heat and management lack of ethics.
good,"great experience"
good,After working there for 15 years I got to know how to do a lot of different jobs in the factory.  I
good,"Handled machine troublshooting,processing problems including adjusting and quality checks."
good,"Inconsistent hours, poor management, most co-workers were not motivated. The job was stressful due to the constant pressure from management to work long, inconsistent hours. I did enjoy being able to bring my creativity to some projects"
good,"Drawing upon a deep knowledge of polymers, formulations and polymer processing, we provide innovative solutions to compete and win.  Our value-creating offerings extend beyond materials to help customers who care about service, technology and problem solving."
good,"Management was fair."
good,"Decent pay. Management is unorganized there is zero communication between management."
good,This was a fast paced job with lots of overtime and long shifts. Good managers and people who were employed there. The hours were not good for a work family balance.
good,"PolyOne Sold the DSS Division to a private equity firm and that changed everything about the management of the company. However, the people at the plane that I worked at were incredible,hard working individuals and made it a great place to work."
good,Polyone is a place if you like to advance no one will ever stop you from learning more . It's a great place to work with great people. I would tell anyone who could stand the heat to give them a try.
good,"Life was alot better when i was employed, dream job until they shut the doors on us. Great pay and hard work. Liked the previous company polycom before this company took our jobs."
good,Every day was a little different from the last. Management was always a pleasure to work with. Co-workers were always a good and competent crew. The hardest part of the job was leaving and watching coworkers leave when Corporate closed the plant. The most enjoyable part of the job was  the interaction with all the people on the job through the years.
good,Not To Much To Say About this Corporation..Fair..Unloyal Co-Workers
good,Company was purchased from GLS.  This was a very friendly family business at the time.  When purchased from PolyOne company to big you were just a number.  Not friendliness place to be.
good,"Typical day at work involves collecting historical data of product and machine yields to determine causes of defects and how to solve them."
good,"Ótimo local de trabalho, ótimos companhias de trabalhos, Gerencia Liberal com bom relacionamento."
good,Nice to work with other crew members who had the same level experience and same work ethics. Strong safety oriented company.
good,If there was more room for advancement and more communication between management and employees this would be a great place. There are certain individuals that receive all the work that needs to be done while others skate by. Once you show your willingness to accomplish goals and make the place better more work becomes delegated to you and then asked why you haven't gotten it all done.
good,Very difficult time tables on projects needed to be completed . Lack of communiction was a big problem. Corporate Headquarters was one of the biggest reason in which unreasonable expectations were needed in a lab constructed environment
good,"For the most part it was a good company to work for.  They struggled at times to communicate internal changes, but this was getting better.  My longest term boss at the Director level was fantastic.  He would support me in any way possible and help support my goals."
good,"PolyOne was a nice place to work at.  It was originally Spartech, but were purchased by PolyOne just before I started."
good,"Work at PolyOne Pasadena is challenging with seldom a dull moment. The day was always full of surprises due to last minute schedule changes, mechanical breakdowns, quality issues and even raw material shortages or loss. Driven to do things right, deliver quality product on time, every time and to account for RM loss. The company uses SAP which is always challenging because something new is learned every week. Communication and training is also key and is definitely something management needs to continue working on. "
good,Ambiance familiale. Port de charge lourdes et environnement poussiéreux.
good,"I worked 27 years for this company and advanced twice in this time period. Unfortunately, they closed my plant down due to downsizing."
good,"Management de terrain d'une équipe composée de 9 coloristes."
good,Good company to work for.  I can't say much I was a contracted employee. I stayed busy processing a weekly and biweekly payroll.
good,PolyOne is very focused on delivering value and getting paid for that value.  PolyOne is very focused on operating income.
good,I worked for this company for around 5 years on and off. I started off at the bottom until I eventually became a machine operator one. The company was initially just glasforms. The boss/owner later sold the company to PolyOne and it became PolyOne/glasforms. I learned a lot of skills while working here over the years. When I first started I knew nothing about machines or resin. I used to look at the machines and just have no idea on how in the world they ran. It turns out that they are not as difficult as they first seem. I actually loved being a machine operator. I learned to multitask very well. Running the machines you pretty much have to watch 10 things at once. You get used to it after a while and it is second nature to you.
good,"Good place to work.. Long days... Good money, Hours are subject to change (weekends) although said to be every once in a while can turn in to every weekend"
good,A typical day at work would start with a morning communication meeting between staff and supervisors to plan our day and build team camaraderie. Then we head to our respective areas to start the days work.
good,"Great company focused on Operational Excellence."
good,My job is enjoyable in the fact that I can move around and assist all areas with their daily tasks.  I am knowledgeable in all areas of the plant and can assist without my co-workers needing to provide guidance.  I enjoy the freedom my job offers and the satisfaction I get out of helping others complete their work.
good,I spend the last 6 months as an intern at PolyOne. I was assigned numerous projects and was able to work freely under my supervisor. I received a great deal of feedback for my work.
good,"É uma otima empresa, porém necessita de reformular cargos e substituir funcionarios que não tem bons rendimentos para não atrapalhar a expansão da mesma."
good,I never thought so much went into making plastic. PolyOne makes over 220 types; usually between 5 to 6 million lbs. a month.
good,They enhanced my knowledge of chemical mixing.
good,"PolyOne is a good company to work for, they have some special compensations yet miss some basics.  They are heavily involved in the community and United Way."
good,PolyOne is a great company but employee benefits and incentives continue to decrease.  Opportunities for advancement are only for a select group of people.
good,"It was just time for me to leave this company.  I began my day at 6 a.m. and usually finished between 2-3 p.m.  However, I frequently took calls at home after my shift ended.  I always volunteered for more hours and did my best to go above 7 beyond expectations.  This job was very stressful and the workload was not evenly distributed among my coworkers."
good,Polyone is a good place to work in Greenville. It is a new plant and you can move in different departments to further your career.  Schedule does change for often from 8 hours to 12 hours and back again.
good,Lots of opportunities.                                                                                                    Challenging work environment.
good,PolyOne is amazing in their field and truly are first class.  Their safety standards are in a league of their own and have shown on their history record.  There is a great job security and the employees are more than willing to step up and help others in need.  It is hard sometimes to make plans on the weekends and sometimes on the evenings of the work week as schedules can changed at any time.
good,I enjoyed working here as an Intern and felt I learned quite a bit about the business world as well as the IT world through experience and ambition.
good,PolyOne provides everyone with a well defined path of expectations.  There is usually enough training to complete the tasks necessary for the daily requirements.
good,"Overall a good place to work, easy to get along with the rest of the employees, good support of work life balance. Have been a long term contractor and they haven't offered an acceptable hiring salary."
good,good environment to work very clean.  a lot of work and can get busy.  some workers are little mean but overall it pays of because of the pay and environment
good,"PolyOne was a very fast paced factory. During my position as Lead Material handler I learned a lot about OHSA, 6S, Trained for Lock out tag, certify to train for forklift/boom lifts. I over seen the mixture of raw material for 16 plastic extrusion lines with 6 team members. I had to ensure everything meet customer specs and record all steps in doing so. Polyones turn over rate is/was very high. so the biggest challenge for me was keeping fully staffed. I did enjoy the daily challenges as thing were always changing keeping you on your toes"
good,PolyOne was a great place to work.  Team player environment.  Employee appreciation monthly events.  Good benefits and compensation.  Management uses open door policy.

good,"It was a nice relaxing place to work and socialize. Most of the work was indoors, except when you had to receive parcels from delivering trucks in inclement weather. I would have stayed but working there for ten years, I wanted to get back to working in my previous field, which was in the safety and security field."
good,"It was a challenging work environment, required a lot of travel.  Opportunity to meet a lot of quality personnel to learn from.  Relied on outside contractors to much instead of keeping in house experience."
good,very fast paced and can be hectic at times.  Excellent benefits package.  If you like to work with your hands or on or around machines this is the place for you.
good,"Balanced company who treat their employees well.  Strong on employee empowerment, advancement, and recognition.  Management structure is a little bloated.  Hardest part is the realistic, yet extensive goals.  The most enjoyable part is the team atmosphere."

good,Able to focus on issues which directly effected the plant as well as issues which touched multiple facilities.  We were able to suggest improvements with the ultimate customer focus which drove changes.

good,"receiving mixing instructions to be used on a large order. working environment that doesn't have heat or air conditioner, outdated equipment.  not enough cross training"

good,Too many changes in manangement. Pay and benfits were great worked in a couple different departments. My boss was great in purchasing and some of the people were great to work with
good,"Great company to work for. I believe they went back to their original name, Spartech. Because of all my duties every shift went by very fast. The hardest part may have been going back and forth between the Laboratory in one building and the production warehouse which was in another building. Overall a good place to work at."
good,"Muy buena empresa sobre todo la seguridad, reparten utilidades cuando las hay, vales de despensa"
good,Fast paced long hours but great co-workers always willing to pitch in and lend a helping hand. Management has recently undergone some changes which make it even better. All in all if you want a job with overtime that rewards and realizes when you go above and beyond this is a fantastic employer
good,"You arrive to work 15 minutes early to find out what line you are on."
good,the first thing you do is start the grinder we would make signs to label are batches. we would start the forklifts bringing in pallets if recycled plastic. once we set up we would throw bits of plastic into the grinders once are spare pallet is filled of the bits of plastic we would load the pallets up and put them on trucks to be melted and repeat till we are done.
good,I really enjoyed working here. Made great contacts to get promoted to a full time employee. Employee's should maybe consider not playing pool after work. Nothing good ever comes from that. Except Awesomeness and regret!

good,It must have been good I devoted 34 years to the growth of Spartech Corporation. Then we were merged into a significantly larger company. The future was uncertain when a new opportunity presented itself. I should have stayed where I was.

good,Just go in start up and talk with others help each other out and to much horse play and not much of shift boss on floor seeing what going on and always see lead guy but hardly any of the supervisor. Pack sides or cleaning and helping were can be used and die splits would have to be the hardest part of the job.

good,Tips typical day at work in a manufacturing plant that I enjoy I get to be my own boss and also train other employees I've received valuable technology I can use is in the future. Bing machine operator teaches you to be precise on the products you produce  to succeed to be the best up-to-date with technology self-taught self disciplined.

I learned how each individual company is to be created equally with the same amount of attention as the prior or next. management was there for the employee as needed. my co-workers became like a family. hardest thing ihad to do was say goodbye the most enjoyable was when we would get rewarded for meeting our goals for that part of the year
good,I enjoyed working for this company the people were great and the management team was outstanding.
good,The only reason I am not there anymore is because the plant closed and left State.
