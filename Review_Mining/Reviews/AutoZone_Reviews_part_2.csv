Although the work place was intriguing, there was always something to do, which again for those who like physical work it awesome. As far as what was learned, a lot, from different types of oil filters, air filters, converters, spark plugs, to changing batteries and windshield wipers. There was something new to be learned everyday. Co-workers again great experience, being the fact I was one of the young guys the sense of humor of the older guys was awesome, but again being the young guy they expected me to work even harder. I would say the hardest part of the job would be truck days. Everything always seemed to be mixed up when it came to the pallets. Most enjoyable part, being active through the whole shift. Always someone coming in and out but never the same problem which kept it exciting to help everyone out and when you succeeded the task it as well was a great feeling."

Another part of the day would be shelving and putting car parts away in their distinct specific locations. I learned a lot of things about cars that I did not know, and I learned a lot more things about customer service. Regarding management, they were very understanding, they're cooperative, they're fun and understand that you have a life outside of work, they're generally flexible with work hours, and know how to run a business. Regarding my co-workers, they're really cool, they all know how to work as a team, they all get along with each other, we all know how to have fun and do our jobs at the same time, and we know how to get the job done. The hardest part of the job would definitely be the multitasking part when you have to do multiple things at once such as shelving and helping out a customer, or doing something around the store and dropping whatever it is that you were doing to pick up the ringing phone.
