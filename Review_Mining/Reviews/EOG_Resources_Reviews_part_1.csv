rating,review
bad,"attended major events in alabama including car shows,motorsports roadways football events basketball events track and field events worked very large venues as parking lot of attendent"
bad,Working and maintaining development with automation and controls in the oil/gas industry. Managing techs in the specific area. Daily checks on the network and data sent to Cygnet. keeping contact and communication up up Engineers and Lease Operators. Ordering parts for each specific job and making sure correct parts and devices arrive to location on time. Programming end devices and setting up communications. Training new techs on the automation with software and weekly meetings.
bad,EOG resources fired me with out notice regardless of being their senior safety hand yet REFUSED to tell me why I was being let go.
bad,This job was only good for un educated students or homeless people. the amount of pay really did not match the amount of hours you put in. I would never go back to this company. They also did not put any money back into the equipment.
bad,"Working for EOG resources was a waste of eight years of my life ,   Their managers and management system in this company is very discriminative, uneducated and dishonest, they have no loyalty to the people and men and women that are putting the shirts on their back’s, after this experience I do not wish to work for another oil field company"
bad,"Older workers are not appreciated for experience. This company uses your experience to train younger workers and then looks for ways to get rid of you. It is a great place for younger workforce; but if you are older, you can forget it."
bad,Management is terrible. Some of these managers shouldn't have those positions at a McDonald's let alone a large corporation with the lack of people skills and no technological skill what so ever. Directors will fly in every so often to tell you your job isn't guaranteed because it's not important and they'll only keep the lowest paid version of your job to save this billion dollar company a marginal amount of cash.
bad,There were a lot of politics and behind the scenes decisions.  No job security and no loyalty    Management tells one thing and does another.  And a lot of shady deals that are very negative to the public
bad,"It's a tightly knit organization where it's WHO you  know not WHAT you know. I was there 3 years, no promotion, token pay raise and threatened by supervisor and manager. They have little respect for tenured employees or your skills and knowledge acquired. No procedural manual, no independent thinking allowed, no respect for personal boundaries and exceptionss made for employment of young non-degreed individuals. It's stressful, sad place to work and there is never time to get to know others in your department."
bad,They will keep you as a contractor and promote you as company. Some people have been there about 10 years and are still working as contractors. As long as you are a contractor you do not get employee benefits.
bad,"As the workforce was a temp workforce, the job insecurity was very tangible therefore closeness between coworkers was non-existent.    No overtime was allowed at most of the admin and clerical positions so your workweek was stressful because deadlines were still expected to be met. "
bad,"EOG Resources is an oilfield service company that offers reasonable pay, but no benefits for the first year. The hours are long and the environment harsh. The job outlook is poor due to low oil prices, so there is little chance of advancement."
bad,"Poor work environment, too many hours, break every labor law known to man. Poor ability to control basic human resource issues.  Poor communication between upper and lower managers"
bad,Company/culture is becoming very cut throat.  Working in the IT department has changed.  Upper management really only wants to hire internal developers.  EOG prefers young developers they can get 5-7 years out of them then get rid of them and bring in a new group.  That is the new model they have in place.
bad,"provides little to no training."
bad,EOG was a great place to work up until the new CEO and new management came into play. Forcing early retirement and forcing long term people to leave. They have NO loyalty for good employees future. Management only looks out for themselves and trying to climb the corpate ladder.
bad,At EOG you can expect to be busy in a fast-paced work environment. but that doesn't mean you are treated well. Many managers don't know the people who work for them and do not take the time to get to know their employees outside of a select few.
bad,Don't care to comment due to not feeling like I would be down talking everyone who still is employed by said company because they are good people and some of the others aren't good people.
bad,"A typical day at work involves a 45 min drive to my first lease which I don't get paid for! My time doesn't start till I reach my lease. I start out by inspecting each well, production unit ,and compressors, and d highs for any problems and fix anything wrong and blow down wells if they need it then writing down the off the meater into my log book. I proceed on to my next lease and do the same. At the end of day before driving off my lease I text my boss that I am out and leave and don't get payed for the drive home. I am on call every other week sometimes more and don't get paid any extra like most companys do for being on call ! My supervisor is very good at his job and tries to help out a lot but I was promised a lot when hired on and have never seen anything I was promised so far! The company has no roustabouts so I well tend and do it all and are way under paid for the amout of work and experience I do and have!!"
good,"Relaxed workplace, fun co-workers, company made up of mostly contractors, flexible schedule and casual dress environment management style is professional."
good,I don't know it's an all right place to work if you are a company man. Other wise you are treated just exactly what you are a temp. I am to old to be a temp in my life was promised a company job 3 years ago. Never came they do teach you your craft very well but they have people leave so often after they teach and put money into you.
good,You start here through an third party. Made little to no OT. I came into the company in a rocky time. Jan 2016. the economy was down.. It may not be to bad but I could not make it on the pay.
good,I was employed with this company for many years. I have had many different positions and have met many people. I would recommend this company to my friends and family.
good,This is a good company to work for if you come from the right school and know the right people.  Benefits and compensation are good and competitive with industry.  Though not a lot of room for advancement.
good,Good job over all. Required to drive to several facilities a day to maintain correct measurement of gas. Co-workers are easy to communicate with. Hard part was the drive from home to job and back.
good,"It all depends on who your manager is. Once you start to advance and if the current manager you have feel as if their job is at risk, they boot you out. Also, don't have an opinion for the better of the company.  They are more worried about ""friendships"" with the independent contractors versus looking out for their own staff.  Some within departments are racist but they notice they aren't getting to you like they hoped to, you get let go for one of their one to move in your position and then quit on them."
good,"I loved my job at EOG, despite some of the frustrations. Their corporate policy of using mostly contractors being the main issue. I learned a ton about the material management and logistics involved in running an oil and gas operation."
good,Culture/atmosphere at EOG was mostly satisfactory. The environment was fast-paced and challenging. I had a great experience and I learned a great deal more about the oil & gas industry. I hope to take the skills I acquired and apply them to future job opportunities.
good,Good place to work and enjoy the co-workers.  You try to help out when needed or at least when asked to help or just give a little bit of encouragement which goes a long way sometimes.
good,"Currently employed on an ongoing Project. Was previously employed on the project prior to the commencement of this one. It's an enjoyable job and I do love what I do, but I think I would like to be more versed and move on to another challenge."
good,"A typical day at work was going into the office first and doing book work, then hitting the field checking all wells on my route, I learned how the making gas process works, management was poor in the way they deal with employees under them, all co workers were easy to get along with everyone helped each other if needed be, hardest part of the job was having to deal with management, most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn how to work on things."
good,You're going to do the same thing every day in your office.. by yourself... It's not the worst place to work but it definitely does not make your days fun or fly by
good,I worked as a contract Buyer.  They do not treat contract employees well.  Some of the actual employees will treat contract people as second class.   Contract people are not paid as good as many other companies.
good,EOG was overall a great place to work. Management seemed to be fair and the work was engaging. Seemed to be a large amount of contractors at the company.
good,"Worked as a temp. It was a really professional place to work at. Had my own office, but they only hire temp to help with the high volume invoice when needed then when the company is all caught up then ur job is cut short and you are not told if you are still employed with them from day to day they call your recruiting agency to call you and tell you that you no longer work there."
good,EOG Resources was a challenging environment with excellent people to work with. I was able to set my own on location hours and the people that worked under me as well. Being a large corporation I was in daily contact with many different office personnel in the Division offices. The hardest part of the job was having to be available 24/7 and the best part was the wonderful people I got to work with.
good,"What I like about working at EOG is the relaxed environment. As long as you work your hours and get your work done, they are pretty flexible on your in/out time."
good,"A typical day is doing inventory and maintenance on all 27 of the wells on 13 leases I operate."
good,"The hardest part of working here is getting recognized."
good,I've learned a lot and they gave me a chance although I had no prior oil field experience.
good,"Worked as a contract landman in a field office for three years. I came in as a greenhorn and left being able to procure leases, run title and cure the title ran."
good,Great place until a sudden lay off of 50% of the workers. Everyone I worked with were fantastic people but the upper management told us our jobs were secure and then layed everyone off the next day. Very nasty way to treat people who’ve given so much to buil the company
good,"Very political environment, women have a difficult time in career advancement.  Because the benefits are so great, people stay even though they may be very unhappy."
good,"People within my team are very nice. Supervisors were nice and understanding, no pressure was given unless month end. workplace culture was good as well."
good,"The company in general was a good company to work for, but if you didn't have the right connections with the right people you won't go anywhere.  Higher up management has too much control over you moving on in the company, even though they didn't work with you and know nothing about your work ethic.  It's who you know at EOG to move up.  My direct supervisor was great!"
good,"Data entry, answer phone calls, batch scan, IP Imaging. "
good,"Good company with fair pay and compensation equal to job skill, forward thinkin vision that allowed input and opinions to be considered.  Overall a good experience"
good,For a female contractor it is extremely hard to achieve going company. While others achieve it within 2 years. Giving a company 4 years with out having the ability to achieve the larger goal of being company is not easy to keep motivated. The people are great. The experiences and ability to be trained is outstanding.
good,"no typical day at EOG, gained 10 years of great hands on experience.  minimal advancement abilities, lots of micromanagement where you were not able to sometimes do your job effectively. the most enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing more with less."
good,"Started out as the place be. Became the last place I wanted to be. "
good,"Rotating call outs"
good,great co-workers and foreman. honest and fair. have enjoyed every day i have been part of e.o.g.
good,EOG Resources is a fast paced and challenging employer.  Overall compensation is excellent and the company strives to be the best in the industry.  Work Loads are beyond what most people can imagine. A great challenge and a great resume enhancer.  Long term will burn you out.
good,It was a great place to work. I enjoyed doing the data entry. The other employees were very nice. They would take us on field trips to the baseball game. We went to Fredericksburg.  I just wished I hadn't asked human resources on average how long does it take to get hired on permanently.
good,typical day at work is cleaning all dogs and making sure they are not sick and that they are all well fed . The hardest thing is getting all of the dogs back in there kennels .
good,"Benefits where awesome, but you need to ask about a lot of them."
good,I really enjoyed my time working here.  Though it was really difficult to go from contract to hire.  I have also heard that they have been doing a lot of lay offs of contractors more recently.
good,"The Management's leadership is safety minded, friendly and focused on daily tasks. Confronting challenges as they occur and resolving them together as one team."
good,there is always a strong support from the management.  has a good pay and good benefit.  A good balance between work and family.  Good environment.  Nice place.
good,Really don't know what else to write other than it was a good and fun place to work. I learned a lot from management and look forward to continuing my career in the oil field
good,"I was able to advance in my field and learn a lot of technical skills that I wouldn't have had in many other companies.  When I first worked for them the team was full of men with integrity and it helped build my character and I'm proud to say I was a great team member most of the time.  When the management changed it completely turned our department upside down and the integrity left and the butt kissing started.  I continued to work the way I was trained and carried my integrity until I butted heads with management.  I have no regrets whatsoever and would recommend anyone to give EOG Resources a try if it's the right group.  Some groups were very immature and irresponsible but luckily I wasn't a part of that one. "
good,"here you have all technologies to learn and focus ,but the manager is little miser to pay the money what you deserve, work wise it is good , you will have more opportunities"
good,"A typical work day consisted of sitting in my cubical, reviewing and approving invoice to be paid. Workplace culture was calm, professional and efficient."
good,"Strong economic company.  Treat their employees fair."
good,"The company is a good company to work for.  Their insurance isn't the best.  Money is decent. They are a frugal company, but will dish out the money that is needed to finish a job."
good,"With a year of compressor experience and an aptitude for mechanics,EOG gave me a shot to get in somewhere and advance at my own rate.After a couple of years the promises about advancement were never fulfilled and I realized it was not the place that I wanted to be."
good,"A typical day at work includes scanning oil documents and sorting scout tickets and cards. I've learned some stuff regarding the oil field that I didn't previously know. I enjoy my coworkers and look forward to coming to work, the work is fun."
good,"overall a good place to work. they took care of their employees. 2 yr probational period before they bring you on. you work for a 3rd party but report to EOG for 2 years and if they like your work they will hire you on to EOG. they go through contract hand pretty quick but if you stick it out and do well the benifits are worth the wait. EOG healthcare benifits for entire family, supplied tools, job security, advancement opportunities."
good,"EOG started as a great place to work for but slowly degraded when the oil prices collapsed a few years back. All of a sudden we were no longer compensated for our drive time. Not a BIG deal but when you're driving an hour to and from work it is a significant amount. When it came to management the higher ups were more reasonable,  superintendants, regionale managers all of them willing to help even us lowest on the totem pole. It was the more direct managers and foremen. They would constantly undermine us, lie about company policy, as well as undercut on ""performance reviews"" all to benefit themselves. But thats what happens in an already broken system. When I left, I was told by my foreman that transfers were unavailable. Only to find out after the fact that I could have transfered if I would have went over his head. This may not be how it is everywhere in EOG, as they are world wide. This is only my account of the oil patch I worked in."
good,"It was a great place to work with the team I was working with. We always had work and things to do and you learned something new every day. However, when the market tanked in the oil field the team was dismantled."
good,Fun events and fairly relaxed job depending upon the event and position. Management needed help wih logistics during the Hang Out Music Festival in Gulf Shores Alabama but oher than that I really enjoyed myself. Thanks EOG.
good,"The company was going through management changes between the Engineers and Marketing Dept. Old Enron mentality was a problem in the EOG culture, and among management that have been with Enron for 35 plus years. Current employees struggled to engage in old Enron tactics, rather than newer ideas and more mainstreamed procedures. With the right management in place and older enron employees retiring, the company will bounce back and become a stronger company."
good,EOG is a strong company that leads the industry in many areas.  It has a history of retaining good people to grow the company an add value to its shareholders.
good,Healthy environment driven by capital and results.  No unnecessary training on the computer or in person - found all training and meetings to be conducive to producing great work.
good,Enjoyed my time there. Met some great people. Great work environment. Learned a lot about the process involved in day to day well activities with vendors and clients.
good,Great place to work. Good stock options. Company is well managed and provides training for its employees to advance. I enjoyed working for the company and would have stayed if my area was not sold off.
good,"New installation of hook up module, challanging. Conditions were good for the best part of the project. Guys at EOG were excellent to work with. Safety was of a high priority both management and core workforce were skilled and experienced in this challenging enviroment and therefore made for a relaxed atmosphere and enjoyable job. Support services on all aspects of the project were of a high quality also and therefore daily meetings made easy planning for the daily scopes. Rig staff were great."
good,I was doing contract work for EOG then hired full time doing the Measurement work and SCADA input into the TOW system
good,I was a field mechanic in the Nat. gas field. I worked on Engine and compressor packages ranging in sizes from 100hp to 1775hp. I was given charge over a few locations to operate and maintain the equipment. We performed various maintenance from routine pm's to complete overhauls. The company would not directly hire employees but rather contract it out from oil services companies for 2 years before direct hire.
good,"The small local office I worked out of had less than 20 employees and sufferred from the age old ""good ol' boys,"" club. "
good,A typical work day was showing up a half hour early for shift change.  Talk over the day for problems or how plant is running.   Then if one coworker would sit at the computer while the other one walked the plant and checked for potential problems.  The you would switch and you would sit and the other would walk plant. Did this all day until shift change.  If you came across any problems you would fix them.
good,"This company was by far the best company I ever worked for, the only thing that made it hard for me to work for them was I lived 3 hours from any of my locations and that made it really hard on me when I was on call so there was multiple stressful nights where I would have no sleep for 24 to 48 hours. Aside from the truck I was given that would break down all the time I enjoyed my employers and my co workers"
good,"Great company, plenty of opportunity to learn about the industry and enterprise technology. Typical day includes business/analyst meetings, programming & application support, data governance, and occasional travel/conferences. Good management on the IT side. Relatively laid back for O&G. Important to strike good work/life balance. Fun staff, some of the brightest in the industry."
good,"Projects are constantly changing, and new projects are always on the horizon. People are given a lot of autonomy and independence, but pace of development is fast and can be very disorganized, leading to work being duplicated/wasted/unfinished. It's an engaging place to work but with few advancement opportunities."
good,"Definitely moved more toward a corporate feel, but a flexible work schedule and a fairly healthy work-life balance. Decent benefits and great people. Mostly pleasant place to work."
good,Typical work day is hectic.  I learned all about the Oil and Gas industry after they were good enough to give me a chance to prove myself.  I was employed for 5 years before the office closed locally.  Management was good and workplace culture for the most part was good.  The hardest part about my job was the lack of feedback.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,"A typical day consists of coordination of work flow for our 4 field offices with 6 Field Superintendents, 10 Production Foreman and 12 Administrative Assistants.  Liaison between them and our Field Production Manager for everything from organizing training and meetings, documenting compliance with requirements, addressing issues and working together to cut cost and maintain productivity and safety.  I also coordinate interdepartmentally to establish a division wide schedule to communicate when which wells will go to production. I also oversee logistics in utilizing and the tracking of 66 pieces of company owned production equipment.  Generation of cost analysis reports, equipment/trucking report and regulatory report for the Texas Railroad Commission."
good,Great place to work. Learned a lot about the oil and gas industry.
good,I love working at EOG - its just really hard to advance. Needed more opportunity. Benefits are great. Compensation is not anything to brag about but the benefits and perks make up for low base salaries.
good,Little room for advancement unless someone left or died. People were great but work was monotonous and very blasé. Business direction > values and culture. Upper management was very strategic and smart. Wish it was a private company :)
good,"This company is ell managed with all stakeholder taken into consideration. I all the industry volatility this organisation remains steady on course of annual goals. Making adjust daily, weekly, monthly annually to keep it on course."
good,It was nice working there. I got let go for silly reasons and was disrespected when it happened.  Was a good company to work for but the manager over me did not go out of his way to let me know where I needed
good,"Enjoyed being employed with this company."
good,"Collegial environment with staff that often work for years at the company.  Work is fast paced and the staffing is lean, which can lead to some people being overburdened."
good,"Unique to other E&P's I have worked at in the sense that, EOG values developing its employees and keeping them involved with the big picture of the company. Weekly Monday morning meetings were held that reviewed workings of last week, what the goals are for this week and what are goals are for the remainder of the quarter."
good,"A typical day at work, log in to my computer check my email make a list of has to be done that day.  Work with division orders, land administrator, land analyst assist them with clerical and computer skills. I learned how to work in tobin land suite and other land applications, how to run and maintain lease log reports. Management was good my co workers were a joy to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to advance and move to different departments.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when they would reward us for a job well done."
good,Work environment was comfortable and most were willing to help and find solutions to problems. Liked working with the engineers. Management was easy to work with.
good,"Overall great.  As with lots of oil companies, a lot of senior people have jobs, titles and authority that is based on length of service rather than any qualification."
good,"I work for the company for 4 years and enjoyed every day they are the most aggressive driller in the industry, they have one of the best safety program around."
good,EOG Resources is a great place to work as a contractor. My experience with this company is limited only to contract work. I did not work directly for EOG Resources.
good,"Was hired to work as admin for S&E department was told I would work 6 months contract and would get hired on by end of contact, instead my contract was extended another 3 months and was told I would get hired upon completion of 3 month contract. I was laid off 2 weeks before my contract ended."
good,I had my daily rig inspections to do and hazard hunting. Checked in all personnel upon entering location. Whether it was a routine site visit or to perform and job duty.
good,"Offshore rotational position, working difficult environment co-ordinating and overseeing brownfield construction and commissioning activities , including the inspection and sign-off of all workpacks and systems at MC1 and SMC1."
good,Typical work day included all aspects of well construction. I learned ways to be more efficient and effective through the use of new technology and forward thinking. Management was effective and efficient. I worked with many co-workers from across the U.S. Drilling in N.Dakota included working during harsh winter weather. I enjoyed the N. Dakota climate changes and being able to travel to see and learn new things.
good,"coworkers were amazing, management a little stubborn at times. overall i would recommend working there. great location downtown."
good,"Overall the entire company has been outstanding to work for. However, due to changing circumstances in my personal life (new baby!) it has become increasingly difficult to be gone from home for several weeks at a time. The company is managed very effectively and we are a top producer in the Oil & Gas Industry. It has been an honor to be associated with this company and also to have made such strides in such a short time period."
good,"great work place with supportive management.  really enjoyed the people I worked with we were like a big family a very, very good company.  very good benefits.  learned all about the production side of the oil field. learned how to fix just about anything an how to work together when need be"
good,I was paid better at this internship which lasted 3 months as a college student than i have been paid at any job ever since. it was too bad that the woman i was working for did not want to take the time to help me learn as i feel this is the main purpose of an internship.
good,"Great Pay, learned a lot, about fast drilling, teamwork and management. great safety program and great workplace culture. A lot of old school people with vast drilling experience. would love to work for them again!"
good,"You worked by yourself with the help of others. Your job was solely on you but there was always someone available to help, yes it was team work, but they also wanted to see how you worked individually. It is a great environment with great people"
good,"Canada Division is now closed, they were a wonderful company to work for, the culture was unbeatable; but there is no point rating them or write a review about them now."
good,"EOG Resources is a great company to work for with outstanding benefits. They have an unmatched work culture and friendly management. I would have loved to stay working with them, but had to move for family."
good,"As a company and culture, EOG Resources is a great place to work. I personally was required to work afterhours every single day (including weekends and holidays). I could leave the office, but the office could not leave me. I had no downtime and I burnt out after almost four years of employment there. After pointing out that a rotation schedule that is implemented for all other departments needs to be applied in my position, my manager declined."
good,I absolutely love this company but new management is allowing to much corruption pass. Employees are top notch and level of equipment is first class
good,I enjoyed my 5 years with EOG Resources learning from several managers in Land Administration. I learned how to process recorded and inactive leases. I also input pertinent data in Tobin.
good,This was a great place to work until the oil prices took a plunge and laid a bunch of people off. EOG will teach you a bunch and there is lots of room for advancement.
good,EOG Resources closed Canadian operations Jan 2015. Selling off Manitoba field and select Sask and Alberta field. Focus went to Texas field due to low oil prices has not reopened Canadian operation.
good,Great place to work management is wonderful. People are friendly fre garage parking. Cafeteria available in building an other places to eat in walking distant.
good,"Everything was great working for them, but 7 days a week with no days off for 60 days was too much for me to balance."
good,Manage all day to day activities regarding well projects. while maintaining cost down
good,EOG is an excellent company to work for. My co-workers were the best part about my job. The hardest part of my job with EOG was the logistical challenges I faced. The amount of area that I had to cover was great.
good,Job security is an issue and are laying people off which is why im looking for new employment . the hardest part of the job is being away from my kids
good,EOG is a relaxed company to work for.  The people and management are great and you make friends.  I enjoyed the 5 years I was there and still have contact with some of the employees.  They take the time to train you but little room for advancement.
good,"This company's senior management team is great. They have a wonderful structure for flexibility... you just have to hope your manager doesn't ruin it. Good place for advancement if you are a ""professional"". This company is very focused on health and wellness of their employees."
good,"Every day started with a tool box talk, where I had to explain to the workforce the outline of what was expected of ourselves that day, answer questions, explain good working practices."
good,"I really enjoyed working here ,most days I was on my own dealing with everyday problems but I also learned to work as a team.The supervisors were always ready to help in anyway."
good,Great company to work for with good pay. Good learning experience in the Crude oil and Gas production side. Computer skills and confidence communicating with third parties and other departments on a consistent basis.
good,EOG Resources is by far the best company I have worked for in the Oil and Gas Industry. There is not enough characters available to even begin to list their strengths. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,I loved this place no complaints!!! Unfortunately the oilfield declined and was laid off. Great company to work for and would go back if offered a position.
good,Fun and great place to work.  Wish I would have started in a better time in the market.  Management is fair and looks out for the individual.  Great a training and showing how they want the job done.
good,"Was a terrific place to work, expected nothing but the best out of its employee's.  Not all employees are over bearing I Would go back if they asked."
good,"This company provides appreciation towards its employees. This company provides support not only within the job, but also as an individual towards any goals."
good,"They care about their employees and offer great benefits, especially vacation and health care benefits.  You felt like everyone was part of one big family.  Want their employees to better themselves by offering training to help you do your job better."
good,"This has an easy work pace.  Good Management practices small or limited advancement only due to the fact that they operate ""lean"" they don't over employ.  Employees are loyal and hard working."
good,"Worked nights,learning as much about consulting as could take in. Caught up w/ the drilling rig.ran out completion work for the time no seniority had to let go."
good,Work load was business. Learned about land leases.
good,Great! This is a great place to work. I am sad I have to leave. I would highly recommend it. The people and culture are beyond amazing. Every one gets along and does their best at their job.
good,Amazing place to work and the people are so supportive.  They are willing to guide you on your journey and give you advice on how to succeed.  Very diverse company with lots of complex projects to work on.  Many opportunities for advancement.
good,EOG was the best job I ever had. The benefits were outstanding and the upper management was the best in the oil and gas industry as far as I was concerned. Would go back to work there in a minute if they had a Production Foreman job opening.
good,Shoveling snow in the winter. Build pumps and hand out parts to the pumpers. Take phone calls for orders. Take inventory of yards and locations.
good,"Worked as a safety consultant for EOG conducted safety inspection of maintenance work and new construction of well sites. Also conducted monthly inspection of H2S monitors and fire extinguisher along with monthly checks of cascade systems at each of the well sites. Managed confine space entries. Performed noise surveys, NORM surveys. Investigated accidents to identify causes or determine how such accidents maybe prevented in the future."
good,"The environment felt like a work family.  We were well compensated with vacation time, and employee stock options."
good,Very good company to work for. Slim to none on home life but I was hired as contract and got called out alot.
good,"EOG is one the best companies to work for! The benefits are definitely among the best in the industry. However, while work/life balance is promoted at the company, not all departments and managers have the same belief."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. Wish they had a full time position available. Pay is great and hours are great..A lot of freedom to work and real life..
good,"A typical day of work consists of purchasing equipment, signing and coding invoices, and keeping accurate inventories of several locations. I have learned the equipment that is necessary in the oilfield and how the oilfield runs. I have gained the ability to run and maintain a materials department. The hardest part of the job is getting equipment and parts for others that are needing them now. The most enjoyable part is getting to know everyone that works at the company."
good,"I have worked with a great group of diverse people during my almost 9 years with EOG and have made many friends that I will have for the rest of my life.  EOG is a great company to work for and has a family atmosphere.  My current Bosses are very thankful and appreciative of my work and let me know often that I am very appreciated.  The hardest part is not knowing the fate of the oil industry in it's current downturn, which is why I accepted an 'early retirement' package that was too good to pass up."

good,"Great benefits and compensation, great work and home life balance, relaxed dress code was a plus (jeans every day), but within a very professional corporate atmosphere."

good,"My work at EOG involved supervision of a team of accountants and clerks tasked with revenue accounting duties for a large E&P company.  Over the course of my career with EOG, my duties were expanded in accordance with my increased experience.  Management training was provided along the way.  In addition the performance review process provided excellent feedback to allow job growth and improvement.  The pace of work at EOG is very fast.  I relied very heavily on my team to get all their work done and to help make decisions for the group regarding job assignments and deadlines.  I provided the expertise on division of interest maintenance, which documents the ownership of oil and gas wells from an accounting point of view.  This allowed me to interact with the other departments such as Land Administration, Legal, Marketing, and Division Land and Administration. The management team at EOG have been working together for a long time and were very knowledgeable about their departments.  The hardest part of the job was balancing the demands from upper management while providing supervisory support for the accountants who reported to me.  I enjoyed the relationships I formed with all my co-workers and the rewards systems in place at EOG which acknowledged hard work and special effort."
good,The Denver Division of EOG was an awesome place to work.  They provided many opportunities for growth.  They also participated in the GCC challenge and offered employees the option to participate at no cost.   The work was challenging and rewarding.  Management listened to employees and valued employees' viewpoints.
