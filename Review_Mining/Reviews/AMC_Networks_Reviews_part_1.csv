bad,"In the dictionary of abusive work culture, there is a picture of AMC Networks Santa Monica. I would never advise anyone to work there expecially in the Legal Affairs department. There is screaming, back stabbing and low pay.....need I say more?"
bad,"If you remember the game MOUSETRAP, you pretty much know what the job is like.  Multiple stations for operators to work at, but not all of the equipment works equally well at each station.  No assigned tasks, feed check-ins are phoned in, so the person who answers the phone does the job; this results in the most pro-active workers doing all of the work. No real job training provided, you learn by trial and error. I feel sorry for the clients. I did learn about satellite signals, and tuning satellite dishes."
bad,Too many people doing as little as possible for as much compensation available. No outlet for young and hungry employees to advance or gain any skills
bad,"Lack of teamwork and advancement leads to an overall negative experience. Not a place I would want to advance my career (if that were even possible here). Free food and swag sometimes are nice, but not enough to justify working here for a long period of time."
bad,"There isn't much opportunity to move in AMC networks as they are an archaic network."
bad,"They ask to drug test you first of all, the pay is good. but days off are limited and the office work environment is SO boring. No fun activities nothing very corporate. you live in your cubicle"
good,"Like most TV jobs, the pay was bad, the hours were long, the management was short tempered. Lots of sexism and the management did nothing when we complained."
good,the job does not pay enough an does not beliebe in raises they want you to work very hard but will get rid of you in seconds to avoid any pay increase or stability in company .
good,"working w/ my team was great, but it has little job security."
good,The culture is the best part of the job. I learned mgt techniques. The hardest part was the merger between AMC and BBCA. A typical day at work would be assisting clients and entertaining clients at night.
good,The IT department of AMC is so under staffed.  There Support Analyst position consists of 4 fulltime workers and 6 contractors.   The full time workers really dont cooperate with the team environment except the managers.
good,"I learned that AMCN has many different departments working on multiple projects, and communication must be clear.  The management typically has a closed door policy, which is not ideal, but you learn to work around that.  The most enjoyable part of the day is collaborating with co-workers."
good,"AMC is filled with wonderful people, who are the best part of the job. Everyone is very committed to the success of their department. The company could use improvement in culture, employee retention and career path cultivation."
good,"The wasn't a lot of room for advancement at AMC. Like most things it depends on what department you are in, but where I was there was no room for advancement, people were nice but kept to themselves."
good,This is a very strict corporate environment -- no working from home or flexible hours. The people are nice though and the culture is friendly. That is all I have to say for now.
good,Some upper level executives lack respect for their subordinates and use their position and power to talk down to employees.  If your fresh out of college and under 25-30 you stand a change at being hired other than that the networks lacks diversity towards hiring people of color.
good,Productive Environment. Too many layoffs and unfocused 5 year plan.  Culture was lost over 5 years ago but seems to be in proving now.  Many good people work here.
good,"AMC is an employee focused company.  Overall, a comfortable environment for most to work and grow their careers.  The company is extra generous in its support of employees Health Benefits and 401(k) matching plans."
good,"At AMC this was a open ended contract position.  Typical day was handling Service Now Tickets.  "
good,"- Continuity game check ins"
good,"The workplace is open and inviting, which is nice.  However, the opportunities for advancement are close to none and there seems to be no emphasis on innovation or thinking outside the box"
good,AMC Networks is a great company with a strong brand via their original series. I have learned a lot of about Media working here.
good,Typrical day at work depends on the work load. I learned different types of equipment to make my job to it's full capacity. Managment and coworkers are very friendly. Hardest part of the job is dealing with many different situations (on-air)  that can arise any minute. I enjoy pizza days! 
good,"AMC Networks is not too big and not too small. There is a lot of room for growth, and everyone is open to meetings."
good,"It was a casual working environment; however, I do think there was a major disconnect with departments which may have changed years later but at the time it seemed to be pretty separate."
good,I choose not to discuss my prior employer on this site. I did not leave the company on poor terms and wish the company and its employees the most possible success.
good,"Depending on which department you are in, duties change but pace does not. There is always something to do and tasks that need to be done. I had both wonderful managers and not-so-wonderful managers. Good place to work if you are a self-starter but don't expect superiors to have a lot of time to train you."
good,"Great company. Good benefits, I wish there was more space to move up, but I've had a good experience while here for 3.5 years. I do sometimes wish there was better office morale. It was a great first job out of college."
good,Responsible for the daily supervision of approximately 6 national movie networks and 6 regional sports networks and related staff being held accountable for maintaining optimum air quality in a broadcasting & technology facility.
good,"The experiences will differ depending on what floor and department you are in. The creatives are much more laid back with little accountability, while the business sides are much more corporate. Some floors are open with lots of light, others are more closed and rely on lighting fixtures."
good,"AMC Networks is a great place to work. It's fast paced, and the people here are wonderful. The hardest part of my job is coordinating personalities, but the best part of my job are the relationships I've built. A typical day is unpredictable as there are so many changes in the day, but most would be spent coordinating schedules."
good,A fun place to work sometimes. The people were really nice and there was always some event going on.
good,"Nice place to work. 35 hours a week can be to little for some people to make ends.  Santa Monica is too congested. The water garden is beautiful on site gym,"
good,"Great face time with CEO, in at 9 out at 5. Wonderful people to work with and fun exciting environment. Very little mobility to move up, no bonuses, and very little salary increases at the end of the year."
good,AMC Networks is a well rounded company and a nice place to work.
good,"Great  opportunity to meet great people in the industry, learn different aspects of the industry and network & connect but no room for advancement,"
good,"Goede werkgever, prima beloning en fijne werksfeer."
good,"I love working at AMC. The people, show content, and work/life balance has made me excited to come to work everyday. My job requires travelling on a monthly basis which allows me to experience new opportunities."
good,Compensation and benefits are good. Company takes good care of it's employees. Free Pizza and bagels 2 times a month. Busy working environment. You have to be A in your Job responsibilities.
good,Overall this place is a positive work environment. Most people will enjoy working here and take pride in the work that they produce.

good,The company provides an exciting place to work for those who enjoy a fast paced and quick changing environment. I would recommend AMC as a great place to work.
good,"If you think you're going to see celebrities at this location every day - think again!  I can't speak on all of the departments within the company but I will say it's really not a bad company to work for. "

good,"•	Configured and troubleshot desktop, laptops, servers, hardware and software problems."
good,"After having worked at AMC Networks for over 10 years, I can truly say that the company offers a wonderful work environment and the opportunity to use your own initiative to move ahead. Even with over 2500 employees, the company still has a very small business like feel."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with passionate people who were committed to their role at the network. I was never afraid to ask questions and ultimately I learned so much from my coworkers. It was also particularly rewarding to work for a television network whose programming I so enjoy.
good,"AMC was on top of the world with hit shows: Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and Walking Dead (at its peak).   Mad Men and Breaking Bad ended and Walking Dead has experienced ratings decline.  Since then, AMC has struggled to remain competitive in the marketplace.  They have gone through multiple rounds of layoffs and I believe are a ripe target to be acquired by another media company."
good,"AMC offers exciting projects to work on with some of the most popular programs on television. The company is willing to offer a lot of experience to young, motivated workers. Although it is tough to move up within the company, the experience is invaluable and definitely worth taking if the opportunity presents itself."
good,AMC has a relaxed friendly atmosphere. Everyone is professional and focused. There is a clear
good,It was a very stressful place when I was there. Not a very good work life balance. It may vary from brand to brand. Salaries were lower than what I saw amongst competitive networks
good,"Really great place to work. Staff are lovely and the location of the office is easily accessible. "
good,This is a great job. Supervisors are always willing to help and teach you anything you needed. I would log in times and report any on air issues to my supervisors and we work together to fix it. Some of the nicest people to work with.

good,Dynamic work environment and executive management.  My Boss retired  This is why I am seeking new employment.  It was a pleasure to support such a great manager.
good,"An amazing team to work for and with. The work load is exciting with a consistent routine. Weekly meetings that explores, teaches and compares the real world to the nature of the company. An opportunity I would definitely repeat again."
good,Great work / life balance with great people to work with.  Great experience provided through a number of career opportunities and very open workspace
good,"A typical day at work involves digital file creation, metadata and closed caption creation often for for delivery to internet television programming providers. I am also responsible for the successful completion of tape, DVD and Blu-ray authoring jobs."

good,"I liked working at AMC. Good people, great shows and the overall support throughout the organization was great. I would advise anyone to work at AMC."
good,"This was my first time ever interning for a large company, and it was not disappointing. The work area is very clean and professional. The rooms are covered with windows, allowing for easier access to others and an open vibe. The days weren't the most action packed, but I was kept busy writing coverages and watching films. The managers are very friendly, and want their interns to actually learn something during their time there."
good,"Typical day a work varies depending on the season, it can be slow paced or you'll be putting out fires all day.  There's a lot of room for growth as they tend to hire from within."
good,"A typical day for a professional Executive Assistant must be geared around the priorities specified by the Manager/Supervisor.  Emails are to be answered promptly.  Travel arrangements, Reservations, Car Service and Expense Reports must be treated in a time sensitive manner."
good,"There was never a typical day of work.  Always different."
good,"Working at AMCN feels different from some other media companies in the industry. It's more boutique in size and scale, so I found you have more of a voice. My coworkers were immediately welcoming and friendly, I got to learn about so many different kinds of roles, and felt like I was a part of an important group doing important work."
good,"Workplace culture is ok, not much incentives, no overtime offered salary is not enough to commute and the cost of living. Needing to find another job or get a second job to help out with the bills."
good,"Loved working at AMC Networks.  Part of a very cohesive team, and felt contributions were held in esteem.  Felt the opportunity for advancement was limited, and took the opportunity to explore a different pathway.  Would recommend the experience working at AMCN."
good,The people here are really friendly. I work at the location in Bethpage so i cannot speak for the city location. the supervisors are easy to talk to and very understanding.
good,"Working at AMC Networks has been a fantastic experience for me. I began shortly after the company went public and our success has a company has increased each year following the IPO.

good,I really enjoyed working for AMC networks the culture was so diverse. My most enjoyable experience was everyday learning something new about the company and people I worked with. AMC Network gave me such a memorable experience being their receptionist .
good,"AMC Networks, on hiring, tells you that they are a family. And that is not corporate hocus pocus. During my training every single person I came into contact with was concerned with how my training was going, asked me if I had any questions or concerns. After learning my job I was asked if I also wanted to participate in their library reorganization, on accepting they paid for my train ride to the 34th st Production and Post facility to meet my manager (same day) he was a wonderful gentlemen whom was very flexible with my hours (at that point I was employed in the technical center and in the library)"
good,"I spent 9 years at AMC Networks. I loved it until I got laid off of course. My job however became ""Discontinued."""
good,"Strong leadership that cares about it's employees.   Fantastic and fun place to work.  Job responsibilities are wide as teams are lean, so can wear many hats.  Taking initiative is rewarded."
good,"Working as a Finance Intern in AMC Networks helped me gain experience and practical exposure to Managerial Accounting, Corporate Finance and Financial Systems. During my tenure as an intern I was involved in introducing and developing financial systems in the organization. I compiled and prepared quarterly supplemental expense detail package and monthly management reports for senior management, performed ad hoc analyses on amortization expense, cash payments for productions, headcount, salary/benefits and ancillary revenue."

You were encouraged to pursue further opportunities, and offered  further your training if you desired. The toughest part of the job was getting laid off."
good,TV company where deliver is the main goal everyday. Short term objectives and quick results. A very competitive environment but a the same time good people to work with.
