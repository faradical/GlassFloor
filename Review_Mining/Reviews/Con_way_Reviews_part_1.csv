bad,Place sucks they have their favs they do what they want camera on  you at all times no freedom micro managed horrible  routes loads I wouldn’t get my worst enemy a job here
bad,"was lied to from day one and didnt know till i got there on my first day . management is a joke and is always looking to slit someones throat to try"" and advance , keep away"
bad,Inconsistent. Been at this job for 15 years +it was a good learning experience. Supervisor was understanding but the company was changing everyday. Great benefits.
bad,discriminative against ladies on the floor I outdent recommend it to anyone unless you like being challenged because your good. and get paid lo pay. nothing is good about this job and no over time
bad,"Very unhealthy place to work dangerous also,accidents happen everyday .I honestly couldn't recommend anyone to this job.without telling the truth about them."
bad,its good at first but then everyone starts ignoring you and you have to figer out wat to do on your own not even the supervisor or manager helps you out
bad,"Bad place to work, bad place to work.  If you like grown men throwing fits like a toddler this is the place for you.  Or if you like management who micromanages everything than welcome home."
bad,"poor work environment, no job satisfaction"
bad,Disorganized.  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Never gave anyone support.  It was a sink or swim scenario.  No one knew how to even train the software.  Company sold out to XPO and then now they are CFI again.
bad,"overworked the employees, never treated the employees fair. would not give employees proper breaks. was not a great place to work at all. company is now xpo."
bad,"Needs work. Leadership is the worst, too much unfair treatment. Lost of unethical behavior. Leadership is key to employee productivity. No effoert to work with employees"
bad,Everything has become about profit since XPO took over. There has been a rapid downward trend in customer care and employee appreciation. I would not recommend.
bad,"i had to go in a just sweep mop and clean. its nothing wrong with that, because i love to clean as well, but the manager was messy and my supervisor wasnt to fund of me. The over all work plce vibe was off. it killed me to go in there. i wondered what was wrong with me and why she gave me a hard time. i even let other co workers check my work but it was always something with her. When i first started working there i was organizing the cloths and then one day i came back they had me cleaning. i wondered why they changed my position. that job i had no enjoyable moments at all."
bad,"The people you work with for the most part are great, but the inability for the company to give you the proper tools to do your job is beyond annoying."
bad,I don't know what else there is to say other than this company wasnt a good fit for me so I quit. Do your research before signing on with any company.
bad,"XPO/Con-way Freights UNprofessional higher management have small (manhood) syndrome.  Act all tough behind the desk and think they are the cats meow when they have no idea what they are doing other than patting their own backs while sticking a fork in others backs. "
bad,"Management did everything possible to not get involved.  When layoffs took place after company was taken over, choices were made on a personal level and not what was best for the business."
bad,"job is easy but management itself makes it hard, then you get corporate who only comes to visit because there bonuses are going to be affected. Meaning there projections for the year are under what they originally thought. Maybe if they pay more attention to dockworkers and management starts listening to them and answers to corporate it would make a turn for the best. But no there stuck in the past that's why Old Dominion is quickly passing them in every way if not they already have. If your gonna work for just a check and nothing else well this is the job for you, just don't no how much longer they'll be around."
bad,"Incompetent FSO's and managers.  Angry, disgrunteled drivers, Upper management clueless about whats really going on.  All you are is a glorified dock worker with a CDL license.  Trust me you'll drive  hi-low more than a truck.  Company is cutting dayshift local P&D drivers hours. Not a very driver friendly work environment.  Don't believe all the made up reviews telling you how wonderful this place is.  Its gotten to the point drivers with time are leaving in droves going to other LTL companies and being offered jobs.  Young hot shot college pukes coming out and telling you how to load your truck thinking you are ignorant and stupid because you are a driver.  Well guess what alot of these drivers are alot smarter than these young p#nks coming out of college with their supply chain management degrees are pretty ignorant for being college educated."
bad,"safety guy is a complete dope.  Walks around sipping coffee and playing pocket pool with himself.  "
bad,"Conway isn't the best place to work, when I worked there I got less than 1000 miles a week. Very poor mileage, and there is nothing professional about that !"
bad,its a good place for begininer to work in the security field. you get to learn the baisc and to maintain theft and fraud
bad,"Semi-good pay. Hours not set in stone.  45 hours one week, 20 the next.  Management not helpful.  Forklifts end to end."
bad,"over the road conway is the worst company I worked for. ""its NOT better here"""
bad,Conway was a very busy store management was not the best hours were guarantedd
bad,"Was a hard worker packed,cleaned,cashier,open closed.I enjoyed working for this store until it went out of business."
bad,"Worked there for over 10 years, they ask you to pretty much be married to the company but give you no job security or recognition for a job well done.  Management is too busy covering their own behinds to care about their employees.  You must be part of the ""in-crowd"" to even have a chance at going anywhere career wise.  If you want a job you can look forward to, this is not the place for you."
bad,"Was misled by employment agency and at interview with Conway. "
bad,"As a temporary employee, you where treated like property or a slave. You had no benefits, and you could only have one accident. No matter what that accident was, or the extent of that accident, major or minor, you where terminated."
bad,"Just learned that Conway doesn't want drivers to work on Monday, December 23, or Monday December 30, and won't pay them those days either!! Nice that they told the drivers one week in advance and it's the end of the year and all PTO has been used up.  Remember Conway, the drivers are the backbone of your organization.  You should treat them better than this!!!!"
bad,can have a better understanding of there workers and give more money and hours
bad,"make you work 50- 60 hours a week without benefits, just because you are ""part time"" i've never heard of a partimer working that many hours. co-workers are unprofessional, everyone including most of the managers and supervisors treat you without respect and are always yelling. very stressful workplace setting, you have to watch for people driving like maniacs not to crash into you with their forklift, and the supervisors just ignore this type of dangerous behavior because it helps to create revenue for the company. faster driving equals more motor moves thats all they see. need to find another job asap. this job is going to give me a stroke or heart attack. if you are reading this please save yourself do not apply at conway, unless you really really need a job  and you cant find anything else."
bad,Worst place to work - believe nothing you are told. Management is horrible; the most unprofessional I have ever seen. I have been a driver for years and I dont know why anyone works at this place
bad,low pay no time at home not the best equipment nothing good at all to say about those bunch of liers
bad,"Hire on at minimum pay for the area, get promised that you're doing a great job and will be afforded a certain opportunity to advance, only to be passed over by a new part time employee. Denied the mandatory annual pay raise given to ALL employees, no reason, no explanation, nothing but good things said about your work ethic and performance, but DENIED. National company has certain policies and procedures in place, but this location doesn't follow them. No pay for over 40 overtime (paid at 50 like drivers, even though nationally, dockworkers are paid after 40). If you work hard, they take advantage of you and abuse your loyalty. If you want a job with low moral, no recognition for working hard, and no pay to back up the mistreatment, go for it, but good luck and be warned."
bad,If you cant get a job at McDonalds then you might try Con-Way.If you like being told what to do every 5 minutes by the supervisors then this is your place. Management is what it is all about. They are the dictators and you are consisderd the scum if your a dockworker. Very high tensions between supervisors and workers and if you have a problem and go to the service center manager you may as well quit because they all stick together and you will get knowhere. Even human resources turns their back on you when you complain about a problem and they also side with management. Trust me this is the BOTTOM of the barrel company and would consider this as the last option. There are way better places out there in the freight industry to work.
bad,i would not reccommand this job to anyone. they make you sit for days waiting for loads.
bad,Management was very unfair. Low low low miles. Lots of lies. and waiting for loads.
bad,Ask any Conway Driver. This company is time sensitive. Tough times don't last.Tough teams do.
bad,"The company ConWay hire D class managers and when a A class employee  they stab them in the back to cover their own weakness."
bad,"Always stressful, can’t trust anyone. A lot back stabbed. Manager doesn’t care about you. Work environment is even worse, horrible trucks constantly breaking down. Always run out of hours. They don’t care if you run out of hours. Company in general , Lie about everything. They fire senior drivers for any reason."
bad,"This place got me so sick, I end up at ER, my stress level was way too hight. I was never able to take a break, lunches. My manager kept gave me more and more work. They don't care about their employees. I witnessed many people leaving the company. If you want to have a life definitely this is not the place for you  to work."
bad,"When I was hired last year at con-way I was told they were one of the best in the country. Bwahahaha, they are delusional. The Reno terminal is a wreck. Mis-managed and crumbling."
bad,There are good Con-way Terminals but Renton is one of the Poorly managed ones and the work environment is very poor.
bad,a lot discrimination.in this company because u are latino THEY DONT CARE ABOUT DRIVERS AND CONWAY FREIGHT HR OFFICE AND MANAGERS THE SAME THING .BAD BAD U SEE NICE TRUCKS BUT THIS COMPANY IS REALLY BAD
bad,"I worked at Con-way for almost 2 years, and I don't ever remember a time when I didn't have to fight to get time off no matter what the occasion."
bad,I have a great Dispatch Manager however most others don't care about you as a person only someone who moves freight
bad,"I thought this company was good at first, until I learned more."
bad,"Learned several jobs while employed here, each job was fast paced and stressful. Learned a lot about the transportation industry. "
bad,"Constantly changing schedule, dock unheated, junior drivers really suffer the brunt of the operation."
bad,"It was an interesting time working there.  The training was tough, but the people were nice.  It was a no paper company, so the only thing was you could print the contracts to refer to."
bad,"General office duties from answering the phone to customer service to human resources to dispatch."
bad,"What they lacked in skill, they made up for with disrespect.  All college graduates were disregarded and a high school graduate with given all of the credit for other people's work.  Hatred was considered a skill.  No wonder they were bought out."
bad,"You are on call 24hrs a day working 5 to 6 days per week  you refuse they are quick to write you up as a book off  They are anti union  I can keep going on and on about this place I would personally stay away there are to many other companies out there that pay decent and also show drivers their respect.4 months then quit. poor management, no room for advancement, NOT expect to have your OWN schedule .Remember Conway, the drivers are the backbone of your organization. You should treat them better than this!!!!  I DONT RECOMND THIS COMPANY TO NOBODY  FOREALS LOOKING IN ANOTHER PLACE U ARE ANOTHER NUMBER."
bad,No review needed. Hard work and unorganized loads for your deliveries
bad,"If the wheels are rolling, you are not making any money.  No home time."
bad,Making sure freight moved to right destination on a timely manner
bad,"Hired there sept 08, laid off dec 08. Was told hiring was for long term, was excited about the possibility of going to work for a good company. Boy was I wrong , management lied from day 1, hours were unstable, work unstable. I found out the drivers attitudes matched the job...horrible. This job was more about Brown nosing suck ups who kissed the supervisors butts. Pathetic."
bad,"If you're a yes man, you'll do awesome. If you're a free thinking person that isn't a yes man, you won't do well here. You make good money to put up with a lot of problems! Management has NO communication! The terminal manager is a liar and has no morals. For someone who talks a lot about God, he certainly doesn't walk the walk but he can talk the talk. The women in the office are so catty!"
bad,The company was a great place to work until all the politics and red tape was set in place. The people that worked for me were top of the industry. Overall at the end of my tenure the company was a poor place to work.
bad,"Horrible boss, He did not fully understand the workload on a daily basis and when asked to lighten it, it just created more work, Very stressful, never enough time to get your daily assignments in your shift done. The only good thing about this company was the excellent pay & benefits. Over the course of time that even was good enough for the amount of stress & health problems it caused."
bad,I worked or con.   Way. For 2.5 years   I have never worked for a company that doesn't trust any employee  you have no voice or rights.  Rules lol they only apply to those they wanna fire mgt is terrible  treat you like garbage play with your income.  Play games with runs the people are the only reason I stayed no ins for a year oh yea sure it useless the first 15 months as before it pays you have to spend. 6k yep they are proud of that too turnover is high terrible hours tons of useless video training myth put on a front for safty as long as it doesn't inter fear with money then you look the other way  horrible company  worst experience of my life
bad,"Top Level management cares primarily about the numbers only.  If you are a family oriented individual, STAY AWAY.  More divorces than I can count.  If $ is your motivation and you have low moral standards, this is the place for you."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this company unless your the type that doesn't mind working their flex / casual board.
bad,"I am a dock worker in santa fe springs ca, the job is not hard but management makes it hard, they train you alot and when you start wrk they push you so much that you can not practice what they trained you to do, the supervisors are only watching certain wrks, while the favorite ones stand around with them on the dockstand every day for hours. you can not leave untill they ok you to do so. They have now trained leadmen in fac because the fom does not want to come out and do the job, its a joke in santa fe springs. Supervisors also take lunch or money from employes in order to let them go hm early.  They have now set up 3STRIKE rules which makes it hard for you to have a long career here."
bad,It is a good place to work if you only wont to work 4–18 hours per week
bad,"company seemed to want to work for you to excell,but supervisor was trying to show managment he could make shop excell with out regards of working employes"
bad,You load your own trucks and unload trucks. There is no standing time. Management is very aggressive. The attitude of management with drivers is not good. High pressure very day from management.
bad,I would not recommend Con-way.  I am not surprised they were bought out by XPO Logistics.  Con-way embraced employees of  hateful natures.  Disrespect and sub-par skills were the standard.  Most days were spent trying to circumvent sabotage of peers and manager.   Spent many nights and weekends completing positive work without indignant interruptions.
bad,"great company when I started in 1996. overall, culture and moral does not exsist. push to the breaking point...then pushed more. we were told it was all for the drivers benefit. not what was promised at hiring."
bad,"Long days without breaks, they call all their employes DSR's (Driver Sales Representative) do to a loophole in the labor laws that state labor laws do not apply to sales reps, if you work the dock all day and decide to take a break after 12 hours they can and WILL fire you for stealing company time!"
bad,Lude and crude work environment. I guess these type of companies are not meant for everyone.
bad,"Worked for Con-Way, Emery before it got taken over, Menlo Logistics, and CNF as tech support for all the companies in Portland, Oregon. Management couldn't care less about you, it was all about numbers. The complete lack of training for my position set me up to fail daily. Constantly blamed for corporate policies, then came the layoffs as they restructured yet again. I would not work for any of these companies if you care about job security, because there isn't any."
bad,"The supposed training they gave me was telling me alright this is what we do now go do it. Then other workers who I thought were helping me train by teaching me the ropes were actually taking credit for my scans/motor moves, so their numbers looked good while mine looked like i was doing nothing all night. This led to me being written up for performance after just 2 weeks on the dock, still in my probation period."
bad,"Every day the management makes new rules. You did notice the criteria for the DSR job posting, did you not? Of course, management and select DSR's don't have to follow these rules - only select employees have to follow all of these rules, and the management is relentless in enforcing rules on certain individuals, threatening your employment with the company at all times,and attacking your integrity, which Con-way says is one of THEIR four core values. If the management does something wrong, they deny it and even adamantly lie because they can never be wrong! There is no mistake so great as that of being always right! Con-way is the ultimate rat race. They get the new guys to drink the kool-aid, and they volunteer to help train professional drivers that have been doing the job for twenty years. Everything is based on seniority, so the more these new guys can rat people out, the better their chances of moving up in the pecking order. Meanwhile, these guys swear all they want and even have physical fights on the premises in front of management without the automatic termination that goes along with these offenses for the select few. It's all about that five dollar an hour difference in pay. If you get that far, you'll probably regret what it took to get there. If you're considering going to work for Con-way, you should ask other drivers, specifically drivers working in the LTL (less than truckload) freight industry. There are worse companies and there are better companies."
bad,"The management is something to be desired,very poor management style. Wichita ks and Seattle Washington"
bad,They lied and told the agency I worked for that I was not productive and all I was doing was following regular employees around on forklift learning dock procedures.  A lot of con is what I think they have with them besides all the damage claims I saw.
bad,"Fun place to work if you are looking to sell your soul,long hours no lunch break. You better eat your ""Wheaties"" before you coming to work.Members of management are unsupportive and pride themselves on making you an example of failure to make themselves look good. Imagine being trained by someone who it took 7 years to reach this position in which you walked in on.(Most management within Conway lack any college.) The job is on the dock (90%) as a supervisor, exposed to the elements. From management to the drivers look forward to smiling in your face  and stabbing you in your back. The flimsiest thing can get you fired. So if you are person looking  for a career oriented job in Management come to Con-way to find you made the worst decision. Good luck..."
bad,"Hit the ground running and you never stop until you leave.  The job dealt with problems constantly.  It was a ""good ol' boy"" culture.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,Good plac to work I wa disappointed whqen it want out of business then clothes were nice I had some of the eat managers  I wish they would bring back Conway
bad,"Was hired as a City Driver, but, for the 4 mo's that I worked there, I went out in the city maybe 5 times, the other time was spent on the dock. Often I wasn't able to work a full 8 hours. It was one of the worst companies I've ever worked at."
bad,"The environment just wasnt for me and management sucked. "
bad,I am a forklift operator loading and unloading trailer the way the manifest lay it out. I am a driver of doubles  and triple trailer driving state to state safe.
bad,Bad company with poor management and management skill. People here do not communicate.
bad,The job was great but the supervisor and job security not so good
bad,"This company is completely two faced everything they tell you is BS from your first interview till the day you quit....and you will quit! It's not a trucking company it's a corporation that happens to own trucks they screw there customers every chance they get but talk about integrity like they know what it means management is a complete joke it's completely unreal like being in the twilight zone the things they come up with, it's just to hard to explain they are without a doubt the dumbest people I've ever worked with at first it's funny but after a while you realize it's not a stable place to have a career especially if you have a family to take care of. That's why the hire people with no experience so they can mold them to be mindless zombies and think con-way is there family. That is the CON-Way! This company has only been around since the early 80s who knows how much longer they will last. The bigger they are the harder they fall "
bad,"No retirement plan takes 5 years to get top pay but expected to do same work, on call sit home all day wait till 4pm most days to find out they don't need you or get called in to work dock 4hrs then sent home or get called 1am to work at 3am first 3 months don't count towards seniority so first raise takes 15 months always being watched with GPS and soon cameras in trucks pointed at ur face very unpleasant place to work don't trust anyone keep head down and enjoy your first 5 years till you get fired....also on call weekends to so if have family wont see much"
bad,"This company full of NASTY political. You will need to survive with play game with them. The HR and Management are low and lame. So, go figure..."
bad,I probably don't need to waste my time reviewing this company but be ware new drivers not a good company to work for you will get fired if you don't do what they want even if means family emergency
bad,"Takes 5 years to get to top rate health insurance has extremely high deductible no retirement package, they will lie to u and tell you they do but it's a lie, sometimes you will work days sometimes nights if you get hurt on duty that's a strike, if you get three strikes your fired have to measure all freight that you pick up and enter in hand held computer that also is tracked by GPS if your at one stop for 15 min you have to call in and explain why. I could go on and on they love to keep employees on the edge and live in fear they expect con-way to be your family if this sounds unreal just fill out app. And join their cult (:"
bad,Con-way freight was a great place to work before ___ _____ became manager. He listens to the wrong people and believes lies told to him. He has no idea how to utilize employee as assets. The co-workers are liars. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things. A typical day at work was watching ___ ____ brow beat the workers and see him never tell anyone they did anything right. No one can be wrong all the time.
bad,Buena. Mi fecha de inicio fue en junio de 2015 y mi finalización en noviembre de 2016. En general mi desarrollo profesional fue bueno. La relación entre compañeros era muy buena.
bad,you must be able to multitask in order to succeed and you must have a lot of patience
bad,"Can improve in managment at the service center I work at. Over all a ok place to work, have some good co-works. Need to improve communication from managment to workers."
bad,"The Manager is a real jerk, he is a yes man and very prejudice against woman in supervisory positions, he has no respect for woman at all. He is ignorant when it comes to dealing with personnel at a professional level. He has ruined the OKC terminal"
bad,"Senior driver BS...dispatcher BS and dangerous. Top it off your a forklift driver and not a truck driver. If you want to freeze and be miserable this is the job for you."
bad,"This is a good job for someone who just turned 21 and is living with their parents. If you have 3-5 years to wait to gain some seniority and don't have any grown folks bills then this is a good fit for you. Everything is based on seniority here. EVERYTHING! The equipment you get to use when you first start is old & unreliable with no comforts whatsoever. Like a/c,air ride, radio, or even a comfortable clean seat to sit on. During the slow winter season you don't even get to drive, you become a dock worker and you work about 4-5 hrs a day 20-25 a week. That's from October till about middle of march. Like I said it is a good company to work for when you get some years under your belt. You get better/cheaper insurance and better treatment too, you get to drive better equipment and even make good money while your here. If you are a man with a family and don't have 3-5 years to wait it out and weather the storm than keep on looking somewhere else."
bad,"The hours and pay are absolutely awful.  The work is relatively easy but there is little to no incentive to actually work hard.  Hitting the bare minimum is the best way to work there, since if you work harder, you're just picking up other worker's slack for almost no recognition or chance for advancement."
bad,"short hours,bad management,bad equipment,policy not good hours are flexible to none company does not stand with or behind drivers management lies to you."
bad,"Hired on to work 50 hour weeks but usually worked much longer.  Management was largely poorly educated and operations suffered as a result.  It's a very old school, boys club, lets drink some Budweiser and hit the strip clubs after work kind of an environment outside of corporate, at the service center level.  If you work at an operation with a night FAC or reship you could end up working nights for years.  If you are working on the dock, and you almost certainly will be, prepare to come home with a face caked in forklift exhaust every night.  Extensive exposure to the elements required since operations don't stop because of heat or cold."
bad,"management is horrible at Conway in Knoxville, TN"
bad,"Really fast pace. 60 fork lifts moving at high speeds for our 6 hours shift. Really dirty, not a lot of space for the job to be completed."
bad,Rules change very often. I in no way saw any chance for advancement and never felt appreciated for my work. There is too much favoritism and lack of knowledge from the newly trained supervisors. I see this company  stating to use more and more temps on the docks which is there way of saving money and taking money out of the drivers pockets. They seem to have forgotten the dedicated employees that have got them where they are today.
bad,I got some good experience for how an office and loading dock work. The hours were no good and pay was not good. They kept you at part time so there were no benafits. It was an easy way for the company to get qualified people to do an easy job for little money.
bad,Conway is a good company with great benefits if your a driver. Dockworkers at conway are exposed the many different seasonal temperature changes and are constantly moving with little supervision and I like that very much.
bad,i worked with some unprofessional workers. There was drama within the workplace often. I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers and customers. I worked in the men's department mostly but i was put where ever i was needed. I would put the shop back items away and help close the store by cleaning the work areas.
bad,Worked hauling double-trailors at night to different drop-offs and didn't work every day. Pay was for miles traveled and hours worked at loading zones.
bad,"Loading and unloading trucks with forklift, i learned to properly handle hazardous materials. The management was always there to help you and give you advice. My coworkers were always there to give a helping hand if need be. Hardest part of the job was dealing with very odd shaped or big freight. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with others and learn from my coworkers."
bad,If you wish to work for a place where Supervisors are not empowered for the future then this is the place! My Experience is Upper Management doesn't care for Educated and Degreed Employees or people who actually care about their future or self.. Company is focus on the Drivers.
bad,You have to load and unload trailers and then drive from one terminal to another and then unload and reload again.  They told us to come in at 8:00pm but we were not allowed to clock in until our trailers were ready and that was at least for 2 hours (not being paid)
bad,"Con-way was a family of productive, high achieving people who worked hard and enjoyed casual team-building activities together.  As economy declined this family pulled together and kept freight moving, then XPO purchased Con-way and on the first day of ownership blew the culture apart and laid off 10% of the company.  Sad day."
bad,"Hired during the busy season.  As a new employee, went home many nights without a load to carry.  Laid several new drivers off on December 31, as soon as the busy season ended."
bad,"Dont bother, there are better driver jobs to go for then a place that belittles you as they get off on treating you like a child"
bad,"The actuall work there is easy, you literally ride a florklift all night. But there is no job secruity there, i got hired right before xpo logistics bought con-way. And xpo cut several jobs including mine."
bad,hired as a truck driver and drive a fork lift. would take years to even be able to drive a truck. not good for someone with a wife and kids.
bad,"Typical corporation. They give you long screwy hours and the pay really isn't worth it. Most of my co-workers are lazy. Management is terrible I've never been talked down too from managers like i have this place. Short breaks and lunch. Supervisors have a problem with showing favoritism. Just generally not a good place to work. Company was just bought out, so things are going to start getting worse. Would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"I worked Line Haul in Blountville, TN very long hours your check shows 38-40 hours But do the math 8pm to 10am 5 days a week isn't 40 hours. Need to change management at some terminals. They watch every move you make from the time you clock in and clock out. Very high rate of back injury, Some of the people I worked with were cool. But there were a lot of workers that didn't want the union but used there years of service like the union. I was union for 15 years and I can say con-way needs a union BAD............"
bad,"It was a rough start learning the call com computer system, but I did."
bad,they were horrible at changing pay rate when i was promoted and with giving benifits
bad,"My days started so all over the place it was hard to keep track of where one day started and one day ended.  I would be called in on days off to move trucks and when I would get there, there would be people standing around, and others would make comments as you walked by.  It was a very stressful and clickish environment."
bad,Tells one thing promise you another and at the end you get fired. This place simply dont care about there employees management is just out there to get you fired. Hipocrits and nothing else.
bad,"nice environment to work in but very scares places to be if you are looking for a job that can help out with you, your families and especially if you got bills to pay."
bad,I worked for this company for over a year as a part-time employee. I attempted to do everything I could do to become a driver including having my numbers show above average every week. I had my CDL when I started and just needed to go through the Conway training class in order to drive.  This company promised me month after month to put me in the driver class. I need to take a CDL refresher course now because I have gone so long without driving. I thought if I worked hard and didn't miss any time I would be with a great company for the term of my career. The company claims to be Lean yet doesn't do anything to enforce the Lean Culture I have experienced at a previous place of employment.
bad,"other divers really helped you fit in and made you feel like your part of the team. load trucks then hook your trailers and go. you get to the service center the back your trailers to the dock, then you unload them and then you load your trailers, "
bad,"Your work group can make or break you, so know who you are working with and have an exit plan in case you learn they are bad.  Mine was bad.  They would not collaborate, listen to new ideas or respond to solutions for improvement. They had one way - their way and actively fought anyone who disagreed. Their preference was always group-think over understanding facts. My manager left, then a new manager came onboard with little experience and very unsure about managing people. It was a disaster. "
bad,It's just a job. They have a great school program but it stops their. You will not want to work their after 1 year. They will lie to you. Fill you full of hope then let you down. You will be on call for weekends for years. And good luck getting 40 hours. New management issues are here. Con-way doesn't care about family. Just move freight and that it.
bad,.miltary type managment.with in your 90 days they push as hard as the can to break you strand you run you out of hours.
bad,I felt like this company did not care about their employee just the bottom line . They just did not seem to care just get the job done and nothing else just my opinion .
bad,"If companies owners weren’t greedy for money it could be a little more relaxing between each pickup and drop off. Need to allow an extra 6 hours to pickup and make delivery. We as drivers, work away from home and family every month. We need to be able to enjoy our jobs. Not rushed across the USA."
bad,Long hours and a lot of responsibility. Lack of business cut my hours every week that I was there. Did not like the fact that I was not home very much. Pay was not worth the stress.
bad,"Pre- takeover:"
bad,Signed on as a OTR driver and quickly found out i was just gonna be doing short haul deliveries to retail stores. When getting paid by the mile this just isn't worth the time. I was doing deliveries that should have been handled by the less than truckload department.
bad,"It pays well if you're willing to trade your soul for decent money. They keep you 12 hours a day all summer, and write you up for leaving without asking if you go home early. Then when it slows down they send you home before you get your 8 hours in. They talk about how much money they are making but can't keep up equipment needed for you to do your job. They give you a board and a handful of nails and tell you you're going to be rated on how many nails you get hammered in the board but won't give you a hammer. I enjoy going and delivering freight to a variety of customers"
bad,working early mornings with low pay with no benefits includes working with no overtime for part-time workers even when you work more than part time hours
bad,"Responsible for credit review of domestic customer orders, collection of past-due accounts receivable, and resolving customer order issues relating to the credit and collection process following standard practice and procedures on all major or specialized accounts. Reviews and reconciles customer’s accounts receivable analyzing situations or data from which answers can be readily obtained to ensure accuracy of the balances due. Provide credit review of new and existing customers to re-enable or process order requests."
bad,Ringing up customers. recovering areas of the store. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers.
bad,"Long Days and Nights, Great Pay with cut rate health insurance."
bad,Working with the customers were great. Loved the accounts that I had. Management on the day shift was a joke but the management on nights was the best. My coworkers always helped out when i needed them. The hardest part of the job for me was all of the favoritism it was really bad in that room. If you did not fit in people made it very hard on you. I did learn a lot from the supervisors on the night shift. They are very helpful and caring. They are one of the biggest things i will miss about that job.
bad,"Use to be the best company ever.   Now it's all about making sure management gets bigger bonus checks.  Over the last ten years we have lost our pensions, vacation stolen from us, sick days taken away, freight given to otr drivers,  lost bids, and now we will be replacing our dock bids with full time dock workers ( they will be paid less ), not to mention no raises.   Somewhere they lost focus on who the backbone of the company is.  Safety is another issue.  They preach safety but then get on you for not completing stops fast enough or not unloading, or loading enough freight faster..  And don't ask for a day off because every day you ask for is full. If you need a day off you better be sick and if you are be prepared to be wrote up.  Just wish I was young enough to leave."
bad,This company is terrible under the new management. Back in the day it was a great place to work. I did business with them going back to 1986 so I know.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers and drivers.
bad,"This is a great place to work if you check your brain at the door. If you expect to voice an opinion or concern it may fall on deaf ears. The pay is average and fair but you are expected to do much more as far as dockwork compared to other companies in the industry. Management is nothing more than a mouthpiece and middleman for the corporation. Everything is black and white and not negotiable, no gray areas."
bad,They tell you how much you can earn but do not deliver to many managers who really do not understand the job you do but are very quick to tell you how to do it . I always wanted to work for them and was very very disappointed when I did I lasted just under a year and could not take anymore and I had people tell me not to work for them they do not ask you if you want to do overtime you are just told and they don’t care if you have family . Great company Great work is their saying I don’t know who made that up but they are  delusional if you like working for  bullies  Then this is the company for you
bad,"ran nights linehaul,high claims but smash the ld in the trailer,management werent leaders,junk equipment,work experience not noted,on call alot,no life but good money."
bad,"Our mission was to bring Conway's ERP software up to date for the 22 Century. They were still working on an antiquated mainframe environment with out of date tools and development software. When best practices were presented to the administration to aid in bringing the IT Dept up to date, they were largely ignored by said administration, and instead the administration drove the development of the project without considering the advice of a very successful and experienced Project Manager, consequently causing the project to run longer than planned. Ultimately we were successful, but that was largely due to  the diplomatic skill set of the Project Manager."
bad,"The job isn't terrible for this area, starts out around 10.00 per hour. You do get regular raises but will never get the full amount of a raise. No opportunity for advancement. The reason I quit was because they denied me a raise because I ""seemed depressed"" all the time. That's just my personality. I just go, work, and go home. Denying me raises because I'm not the type to be attached to a backside isn't okay. The raises were not based on work performance at all. The benefits aren't good either. In two years I was only making about 12.00 per hour. The job itself isn't absolutely awful."
bad,"This company looks more to who you're friends with rather than what the quality of work is for promotions. Poor place to work, not recommended. When working in some departments you are ""black listed"" from applying to other departments because the revolving door of turn over is too high. Poopy hours with low pay make for a lack for morale. They pay you like an entry level employee but expect seasoned career work. The micro management in certain department is amazing, the management scrutinize every minor detail but expect you to try and take ownership."
bad,They had a home away from home. Good about hometime. Pay is reasonable. Glad they had a management turnover because the old was ungrateful. They send their drivers to small docks and expect no scratches and dents on their equipment
bad,Pay wasn't that great. Be prepared to work on the dock in negative weather unless you're top on the list and still be prepared. Only great runs depending on terminal. Benefits are not that great The most I've made was 900 bucks a week.
bad,Depending on what center you get placed depends on the review you have for the company. Some are excellent places to work and promote a good work ethic. Then there are somme that management has there favorites.
bad,i broke down every week that i worked there terrible trucks i could not make any money that way so i had to find something else
bad,"They work you nearly 12hours at 10hrs pay. Everyone makes more than the supervisor when you break it down, including dock workers and CSR's. The people you manage. They promise you many things and opportunities and then place you on the back burner for their own use and disposal."
bad,"Hard work was hardly appreciated, you were given very little hours.  Co-workers were the best part of showing up to the job."
bad,"The training was awful, I sat beside a girl for 3 days then she moved to a whole different dept, so I was thrown to the sharks. One of the ladies on my team was a drama queen, If you put on lotion she would put on  show by coughing up  a lung, she was under the impression someone made her the boss. She complained about EVERYTHING and I couldn't continue to work in such a negative, unfulfilling workplace."
bad,not great pay management good benefits and bonus to move up you have to transfer all over the country
bad,"You were mainly a dock worker 90 percent of the time. Most night supervisor had no real experience in supervising. "
bad,"Working Mon-Fri as a part-time dock worker, I see every aspect of the jobs that everyone does on a daily basis. EVERYONE looks stressed and angry at everything constantly while working. This is a solid job for a college student to make some decent cash while working here part-time. Every full-time employee I see looks stressed out to a saddening level. If you need some cash as a college student, or just need another job, the part-time positions are ok. If you are looking for a full-time job and love spending zero time with family and are looking to become married to a job with way too much stress, apply here. I see and hear people everyday on this job complain about everything. Management is HORRIBLE"
bad,"Conway was indeed my first job, i was really excited to work there, On my first day of work i was trained on the cash register and did an excellent job with no problem, after that my manager decided that she needed someone for the shoe department, So my job there was to take the shoes out price them and put a sticker with the number of the shoe size and than process them to the floor, As well with the lady's department too, Ever since i started working for conway they had me working in 3 different stores in less than a year, My managers wouldn't give everyone equal right which i always found messed up, for example, who ever clocks in first gets to go on their break first, instead they would let the person that came in first go on their break last which upsets me the most, Also, when you already made your 3 months your suppose to get a raise, I was still getting payed 7.25 until minimum wage went up, I called the corporate office and they never helped me out, and I been working for this company for 9 months already, Also one of my managers was taking hours out my check and I had to report it. They also backed my check up 3 times so instead of getting my check on the week I was suppose to get it, i would have to wait till the  week after to get the check that was backed up including the check for that week. What I love most about my job is my co-workers they are really wonderful people. The hardest job for me in conway was, taking HBA & Linens merchandise out pricing them and on the register at the same time, It was hard for me because i also had to process them and I was the"
bad,found it very hard to stay positive here you had to bust your butt to no end. you have to fight just to get your 40 hours in and they act as if you owe them something when you do.
bad,"They strictly go by seniority, so when hired as a CSR/Biller, you will work the shifts that no one else wants. Unless you want to drive a truck, do not work here."
bad,I understand most people dont like their job but I had a horrible experience here. The only people to move up at this facility are relatives or close friends. If you have no relation to anyone good luck. I was there for more than I few years and still part-time. I recieved no bennifits the entire time and worked as a dockworker 60+ hours a week. Mean while new employees around me went full time after 3 months. Later to find out those people were somehow involved with managment. I also saw a lot of unfair discrimination.
bad,Multitaked and very busy Customer Service. Customer relations
bad,"I worked in Conway before they officially opened to the public and after. Everything was kind of out of place but once mistakes started following the mangers and employees adjusted. Conway had a lot of drama that could have been avoided if mangers would have taken action faster. I learned from this company to keep record of what you do, how to handle rude customers, how to work with difficult people, and you can get raise even if you team lead does not."
bad,"Excellent benefits package, poor emoloyee support system which led to a lack of professional development."
bad,this company lives and breathes off of micro management. every single small occurance & your threatned with unfair write ups and suspensions.
bad,"Working on a cross dock is very much like working outside. Rain sleet or snow, your expected to do your job the exact same way. You can dress for the weather n take other precautions, but you also want to be paid enough money for the hardwork you encounter."
bad,locations are not properly staffed and with no cross training on different aspects of the operation makes it really difficult to maintain efficiency when a supervisor takes a day off from work.
bad,"A typical day at Conway goes by pretty fast depending on how you work."
bad,"Watch your back and keep you mouth shut, lots of gossip, co workers  made this job nice...."
bad,Poor work/life ratrio. good pay but does not equal out for salaried management.
bad,"I felt treated unfairly. Myself and one other woman worked as drivers, it was as if they hired us to meet the state requirements."
bad,The particular terminal I work at is extremely unorganized and undisciplined. Upper Management is very distant from Operations Management which can be frustrating. Many veteran employees have been allowed to 'run free' for years and it makes for a unbalanced work culture.
bad,the most nice part of conway is the lead with whome i worked with .lead was very cooperative and understanding with timings. use to come early and leave early.
bad,over  all it was a good company to work for . from time to time the upper management would change policies that would affected your way of life  I would go back
bad,i think the owner hates truck drivers because everything you like about trucking is taken or against the rules. they have been bought out so perhaps that has changed.
bad,Very mixy and hard job a lot of people around at all times ' I've learned to mange my time around certain areas at certain times and always be  available  for every customer at all times
bad,Easy work on the forklift all day aslo not climate controlled at all. Fast paced environment so i dont really recommend if your not into that
bad,"Benefits get worse year after year, never improving.  Salaries are almost stagnant.  Managers will have it their way every time."
bad,The only thing good was the paycheck. I swear they suck...... they mostly care about themselves. You'll be a truck driver that paints floors for them and they give 2 cares.
bad,"Management is very inconsistent.  Could be a good place to work, but hard to tell how bosses react.  The culture always changes, doesn't seem to stay consistent at all.  Makes it difficult to know where you stand."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is merchandising the ladies department.
bad,I was treated with little respect there because I was a dock worker only
bad,always on call nothing the same
bad,Conway was my first job it was okay working there. managers were good i liked to work there but it wasn't that much opportunity to growth as individual
bad,"Very cold or hot, depending on season. No time off, must flex with schedule.. only go home if they say it's OK, Pay is 16.00 an hour, cap out at 17-ish. Bad culture, everyone's grumpy from being over worked. Dangerous conditions on dock, forklifts flying around and you will breathe in black tire dust... possible lung problems over time. They do pay well, and cook for you a few times a month."
bad,"I was targeted for reporting a senior member for ethnic discrimination.  The senior offender was not terminated, however I was.  This company puts high demands on its employees and and does not go up to bat on their behalf."
bad,very long hours no work life balance if you have a personal life a family or wife tell them goodbye now...great job for a young guy with no responsibilities besides work. be prepared to drive and work the dock  then drive again after the dock work is done.
bad,"Low cost Insurance. Good pay. Poorly managed, equipment needs updated, too much company politics. Micromanaging employees causes confusion and frustration to good employees."
bad,"good company, I loved working at Sysco until they hired new trans Director.  just regular pencil pusher new nothing about truck driving. Always routing from computers no getting driver input."
bad,"A typical day at work is great. I love all my co-workers, now as far as management I can say there is no respect at all. There is too much favoritism in this workplace. I've learned how to operate a 18-wheeler , also pulling doubles. The most enjoyable parts of the job is my co-workers."
bad,"employees are great to work with and the money was more than fair but the dock conditions are appalling.. potholes, equipment circa 1985, all injuries are deemed ""preventable"", no heat, and Management through fear and intimidation."
bad,"Typical day as driver, you go in, get assignment, work dock, leave on route, work your butt off, take half a break if you're lucky, come back and work dock. That is after you spent a year on the dock, working whenever they told you to, or not to. First year is tough. Don't bother to try this if you are not going to stick up for yourself or you are anything but a white guy."
bad,Another company took over and shut down the driving program so there is no other choice but to move on and they left the same Management in charge instead bring in new people
bad,"There was no leadership by higher personnel, it was not a work friendly environment. From workers to supervisors, there was tension and not sense of team work. Poor Leadership."
bad,"Dit bedrijf levert in heel Belgie en Nederland alsook Luxemburg"
bad,"Ok place to work, but the transportation aspect opened the doors for a hostile working environment."
bad,Very rarely did a day go by without a hit to there safety record...
bad,I had to research and analyze a wide range of topics to develop a marketing strategy. It was difficult understanding an industry and function that I knew little about coming from a supply chain background. My manager was often difficult to contact and fairly unhelpful when I was able to speak with him. I was able to work remotely while I attended school but unrealistic expectations and very large sets of ambiguous data demanded more time than I was able to devote.
bad,It was a good company to work for but not enough hours. I learned how to load freight in many different ways. I did not like the manager worked with because we did not have many trucks to load or unload. My cow workers were fun to work with and helpful. The hardest part of the job was different work hours daily
bad,well it was a hard job because the store were big and just me working as a Security Guard. with no help
bad,Not all what they are. Drive all 48 states to deliver load. Long hours if you are a solo driver teaming is the way to go and make money.
bad,Purchased by XPO Logistics.  Eliminated many great people and key positions. The new company has not continued the Con-way culture.
bad,"Good work enviornment, with decent management, really enjoyed working there, but very unorganized working system, and random hours, with little chance of becoming a full-time employee."
bad,"- What I learned was how to safely and efficiently load freight for a premier LTL Carrier,"
good,"A typical work shift was spent on the computer entering bills. My typing and computer skills improved. The management played favoritism towards the mall. I enjoyed learning a new skill, but I need more interaction with people. I love helping people and talking. My coworkers were wonderful, best part of the job."
good,"This company does not allow you to work for yourself. They are unwilling to work with someone that tries to carry multiple jobs, nor do they care about the employees. There is no advancements within the company."
good,"Work day 14 hour on duty.11 hours driving."
good,"Your worked 12 hour days. You never knew what was coming the next day. Management turn over was worse than the turn over rate for drivers. You were call all of the time, and you never knew what time you were going to get called in. It was really hard to keep any kind of schedule."
good,"I managed at the Minneapolis Terminal for 6 years. Started out on 2nd shift, working from 2pm to midnight (sometimes longer). Put in a year and moved to days, working Tuesday thru Saturday, another thankless position. Eventually moved to Morning shift, 330 am to 2pm. Do the math before you apply, as its the land of broken promises.  Work\life balance is non-existent! This is a great job for a single person with no kids. They will work you to the bone, then tell you didn't work hard enough."
good,"very busy best fast paced environment very chaotic and yelling .if deadlines arent met, or people talking sitting around, another trying situation to the job is working outside but other than that its a business and i understand."
good,"Management doesn't care or listen to drivers and.  They only worry about whats best for themselves.  A lot of issues start with them, and they don't like it when someone tells them so.  if you want a family life, forget it.  the hours that you have to put in to make a living don't allow any room for that.  They always talk about safety this and that, but really its all about getting the job done fast and doesn't matter if its safe."
good,You have to load and unload trailers for most of your shift. If it's busy your definitely working over your legal hours. To many supervisors in every terminal you go with a bad attitude it seams like they have no social skills.
good,Anywhere between 10 to12 hours per day loading and unloading of truck helping driver with there loads
good,Nice place to work they need to change there management they have very poor management team.
good,"na 13 hour days, manager unable to train does not know, co workers hanging on side of boat"
good,"I had no choice to leave. wasn't giving up my pet of 10 years because of idle time, they left me no choice. if you had a long layover in Laredo texas in the summer, they expected you not to idle your truck,"
good,A typical day at XPO Logistics would consist on a constant pace of moving freight no time to small talk and being productive. it is challenging but a learning experience to most i like the challenge and the people its long hours at this facility being the largest facility in california there is a large work load that comes thro this facility so you always have to be on your A game.
good,My typical night was Bills of lading and Over the road carriers getting their loads. I work on the sector desk to perform secretarial duties for the drivers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Conway. I got along well with co-workers. Management wasn't perfect, but they were nice. I mostly enjoyed just working."
good,This company seemed really behind in IT solutions.  My manager was not my favorite person in the world.  I don't think he really understood what my job included.
good,Being lead to the same work standards for cargo claims conclusion as all other examiners while being pulled by the two department managers and director to hold their hands on every 3PL claim dispute that landed on their desk took it's toll.  It became increasingly difficult.  I would receive calls from the director when I was on vacation to assist him because they did not understand third party logistics and had no desire to learn because it was easier to pull me from my work.
good,"The best part about working at Conway was that I gained experience in data entry, but there wasn't any opportunities in advancing in the company. Being a data entry clerk was the furthest I could go and I want a company that I can grow in."
good,My days started by runnining reports for incoming frieght. Resolving shipping issues in house and other locations in district. Training managment and new hires in receiving. Pulling merchandise for floor teams to work for that day. Emailing problem shipments that I was unable to fix myself. One of the hardest things I did was trying to get the floor associates to understand the importance of keeping shrink down. I really liked the fact that my supervisors new that i was very dependable and my work was exact and correct.
good,"to each his own in this company, seniority doesn't really apply to much here, also very repetitive and easy to catch on."
good,only good thing is the pay and benefits. very stressful place to work
good,This was my first job after completing truck driving school. My most positive memory is that there was always something to learn and there was no hesitation in teaching.
good,"Busy work days."
good,"HR called me about a job I applied for in admin, the only thing I was asked was ""you said you were referred by an employee, who do you know that works here? Ok we'll be in contact with you"" that was it! Over a month ago! Ridiculous! And the techs in the shop need to go back to school and learn how to work on the tractors since they can't seem to fix a darn thing!"
good,"I started working for Conway Freight out of the Reading branch. Was a great experience, good group of guys, including the terminal mgr. I never should have transfered. I was moving to Allentown and transfered to that branch first. I was there for 5 months, hated it, management left ALOT to be desired. Ended my career with them there. It's incredable how differently a very large company can be run so differently from one terminal to another."
good,I think that the job determines too much work for minimum work pay. I feel that the managers at every outgoing and easy to talk to. I think that a typical work day goes by so fast.
good,They expect their trucks to get 6.5mpg of driver faces consequences for not getting it up to termination. Was threatened with termination because the truck was only getting 5.9-6.1.
good,"I typically worked 12-14 hours per day, 5 days per week. I got along with most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being called every night to find out what time you were coming in and where you were going. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationship that I had with some of my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work is normal , How to drive a truck,Not so much of a great management team. I learn skill work driving forklift and learn how to drive truck, I feel like i was treated unfairly."
good,"All in all, it was an OK place to work. Being only a temp employee, I was not subject to any paid time off or vacations. There was NO chance of advancement."
good,driving long haul was ok. gave plenty of time to get to customer. Would take a week or two to get you home.There where communication issues between driver and dispatch.
good,"12-14 hour days, learned anyone can run an LTL company, management is inept and uninformed, hostile work environment often confrontational, hardest part is working the outside dock and you can't feel your toes, most enjoyable part is not working there anymore"
good,new company going down hill. After the buy out by XPO the old conway is gone and never coming back.Never know what the goals will be week from week or if you will have a job the next day.
good,Conway is a good company but management in the shop needs to be retrained. Lack of people skills are a major problem. I enjoy working with my felow co workers but there needs to be major changes in operation.
good,Loading and unloading semi truck trailers all shift.  Heavy forklift use.  Spatial awareness is a key skill with this job.  You can ask just about anyone for help or advice on any particular load.
good,No raise in past in three years. Hard to get home when planed to be home. To early or to late never when planed. Not enought home time.
good,great job at one time but I believe the incoming new owners have upended everything to the point the office employees in Joplin now their days are short so their willingness to do the right thing is history. O and how dare anyone want to go home ! Lord !
good,"Depending on the location of the business unit, Con-way can be the greatest job or the worst job you could ever have.  I had the pleasure of working at two great locations and have nothing but great things to say about the employees who worked there.  Con-way is very challenging for management whose operational directives change often and frequently conflict with previous directives.  If your looking to learn the ropes, work long hours and sacrifice a work/life balance, Con-way is a good company to work for."
good,"Was a great place to work with advancement positions available.  Compensation was higher than any previous position held by myself.  I was able to work at my own pace make decisions that affected production for myself and my co-workers.  That has changed drastically in the last three years.  I used to think work was fun and so did my co-workers.  Management has become micro-management, stress levels have risen drastically for myself and my co-workers.  I've learned to keep my opinions close.  Compensation has lagged drastically especially health care costs eating away any gains.  It is still great to go in and see my co-workers who I consider my friends.  Also the customers that I have developed a relationship with over time. I would like to get back to feeling that what I contributed was important and appreciated. my co-workers and I feel that is extremely important and is lacking at this time."
good,Needs new mangers and there wasn't enough hours for work. Also there was a lot of arguing
good,"A typical day at Conway was usually busy. There was never a dry moment. In the mornings we stock up the store before we open, we serve the customers and help them shop, we clean as the day goes on, and we walk around the block advertising sales with coupons."
good,"If a Morning shift- production (pricing various items and arranging them on the floor for purchasing)"
good,work 8- 10 hrs day load / unload trailers delt with hazmat used forklifts  learned how to load weight correct for scales. trained new drivers on the dock. liked most people that came in contact with.
good,"A typical day at work involved me checking bags, I.Ds, and returns. I have learned the general basic as a security guard/officer working at this job. Management at the job was organized. Co-workers were very good to work with besides a few. My job was not hard besides the part at the end of the day when i was responsible to check all employees’ bags and belongings to see if any product was stolen from the company. Mainly Con-way was a good job to work at.   "
good,"Learning to read Bills of Lading, editing the bills according to code and process the bills of lading. I learned to file the bills and drivers receipts."
good,Mi trabajo en Conway era un poco atípico por mis viajes a realizar implantaciones de gasolineras por toda España
good,"Most trucking companies will hire anybody with the proper license and not too many moving violations. They will pay you not very much a mile and not give you very many miles. These companies are, possibly, very, very slightly above average."
good,"Started out in Accounts Receivable and made it over to phone sales.   I covered the Cinncinnati and Northern Kentucky area and needed to make 30 ""quality"" calls a day of at least 3 minutes each.   Sales had nothing to do with it, it was the ""shotgun"" effect out of control.  Talking people into shipping when they have no product or their business is going under.   Very stressful."
good,There was a very low amount of hours allowed to the employees which caused the workplace to be tense. The company was losing money and the store was about to close.
good,I don't really have much good to say about the company from my experience it was a lot of things going on internally that I and other coworkers didn't approve of but the pay was good. some good management but terrible supervision and culture.
good,Need unions  make you work on the dock as a driver for hours and then let you go out for a few hours to drive and then come back and make you work on the dock again
good,"If the promotion of a healthy work environment/culture were made a priority, this could be an excellent company."
good,"Con-way Freight was a great company to work for, that's if you would like to stay in one position without advancement. In most of their salary positions there is no room for advancement only room for raises which most of the time were only 2%. (the politics average) The best thing about the job is I learned the in's and out of cargo claim and its was never a dull moment."
good,"equipment was the best i experienced, but the wait time between loads the worst, very competitive pay and benefit package ok to"
good,Loved the majority of my coworkers. Management was not understanding. The position I worked was very slow I like to be busy
good,"dispatched 40+ drivers per day for pick ups, deliveries, and switches.  I was the only dispatcher, it was very fast paced and busy.  multitasking a must."
good,the job would be a much better place to work at if they would consider increasing pay wages for dock workers like they do every other month it seems for everyone else. also if they would get a set amount of hours daily that the employees would work it would help a lot with balancing home and work life.
good,"8 to 9 hours a day drive time and 3 to 4 hours dock time.  Learned how to transport different material and load and unload trailers.  All the workers worked as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, and how well we all worked together."
good,"I worked for Con-way for 3 1/2 years, wasnt a terrible place to work but far from the best. They pride themselves on being family and employee oriented but that couldn't be further from the truth.  typical day for a driver. Get your truck, hook to whatever kind of trailer dispatch tells you to get, spend about 9-10 hours in the city doing PU and deliveries, then when you get back you are expected to check in. whether you were told to or not, you have to check in. however this on applies to certain people. some go straight home and nothing is said, other go home with them and get written up. the FOM and one other supervisor on FAC shift are the worst. Mark stapleton and Mark robel both violated a companys core value yet they retain their positions. Integrity. They both need to look up what that means. If you need a job and can somehow avoid ever having to make contact with them, then this place isnt too bad. If you are forced to work the FAC shift, might as well keep your resume updated because you wont be there long."
good,"Una semana lunes y martes vendia y miercoles repartia,jueves viernes vendia y el sabado repartia,la otra semana el llunes y martes vendia el miercoles repartia,jueves vendia y viernes repartia,con 10 horas de trabajo diario."
good,"Pros..."
good,"Moving freight all day,I learned how to move odd objects.Management is fair and my co-works are a nice bunch of guys.There are no hard parts.The most enjoyable part is the challenge."
good,"Everything you have read about working 12 to 14 hours with only one 30 minute break is true. And Some management do micro manage and gossip. I have worked for other LTL and with the exception of the Excessive over time. The others are the same way. Money is good, Cameras are in the truck ( for safety)  And Con Way does act like you are a lazy bum if you want to go home before working at least 10 to 12 hours. Health care is only OK.  If you want home time this is not the place if you like over time and a chance to make a lot of money and can handle some stress. This is a Ok job. It is not rare for Conway to ask you to use the 16 hour rule to work more hours. They tell you once a week it allowed. But when you say working that late I do not feel safe. They act like you are weak while the CEO says Safety is priority ONE. He may not know what really goes on/"
good,If your in the click you got it made if not you will not advance in the company.
good,"i't just a part time for a few month is not a bad company to work for ,I don't have much to tall you"
good,"A typical day at work was to come in and take over the main switchboard.  Working a 9 line system witch most of the time light up all 9 lines coming in.  These calls were requests needing pickups or deliveries.  Made contact with drivers making deliveries if they had a problem or had trouble getting there due to traffic.  Handled all calls going to 7 managers who most of the time needed special handling.  Which I had no problem servicing them.  I won all contests for my customer handling.  One of which was a trip to Florida for 5 days. I was 1 of 10 employees out 20, 000 employees who got to go due to our work ethics. The hardest part of the job was as the phones rang, other employees were reluctant to relieve me when I had to go.....I had to raise my hand and wait till someone would come The phones had to be maintained at all times.   The most enjoyable time was working with people who were younger then me.  I was the oldest and they were amazed on how quickly I learned the switchboard, never working on one and how fast I caught on to that fast pace job..."
good,"A typical day at work is going in, checking my truck and finding out if I am going to be on the road that day or in the warehouse all day.  From one day to the next you did not know what you were going to do.  What I learned is that if they do not like you from day one, you would have a hard life with that company until you were gone.  Management was fickle.  If one manager had a problem with you, it spread like wild-fire and they all would have issues with you.  Especially if you were non-white.  I made a lot of good friends in the other drivers.  There was the HR rep who hired me and he and I were good friends until he was left go and I was told to stop talking to him or I would have issues.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with the politics.  I loved driving when I was on the road and my customers loved me and I loved seeing them on a regular basis when I would have several days out.  That was few and far between.  They were hiring more people than we had runs and they were letting the new guys go out on all the runs."
good,"I've been here just over a year, this is the most depressing place I have ever worked at. Coworkers are nice and you wouldn't say so just walking the dock like management does but it is. To many chiefs here. Lean program is a joke, we have 2 guys getting paid $30/hour to do maintenance duties and they work 10-12 hour days while people who want to be in the program are basically just pushed to the side. Work is based on senority. New people less than 2 years with company don't drive much. I still work the dock like 80% of the time. Didn't drive a tractor outside the yard for the first 2 months here. Now I have a few people below me and they get alot of the night city work while I get passed because they bring me in before them so I get 8 hours if I'm lucky. Dock, dock, dock, thats top priorty for newer employees. And if you forget something or misload freight, management will call you over and you gotta explain yourself..Don't expect to get good shifts, Mondays and Fridays are always late nights so don't expect to get off early like you do tues/wed/thursdays. Seems like this place was better to work for before Conway Corporate took over and made a third of the workforce chiefs and everyone else indians. People who work the hardest like dock workers/newer drivers do alot of the gruntwork and get paid the least"
good,"Like most strong professional companies, all of them possess and follow the guidelines of their own P & P (Policies & Procedures) manual. I am a firm believer the P & P's lay a solid foundation for the company and the employees. It is extremely important to clearly conveyed properly the intentions of each policy to ALL employees, management included. In my 21 years with this company, on many occasions I witnessed managers twist the true meaning of an individual policy to better benefit their operation or help support their disciplinary action against an employee. Remember these ""Rules"" or ""Laws"" submitted to every employee at the time of hire are written by a team of lawyers. The context is written within a fine line allowing the interpretation to be adjusted for the companies benefit if needed. It is very important to understand this at the onset of employment and adjust your work ethics accordingly."
good,"High expectations from employees, no regards to employees safety."
good,"I have met and worked along side many good people. You are told to focus on certain hot button issues and try to resolve them, all while the next ""new"" issue is being promoted."
good,Management was not working together well and allowed personal feelings override professionalism. Some merchandisers not trained properly.
good,"Conway was a good company to start out for did a lot of traveling all over the US and Canada, which was fun. but quickly turned out that I wanted more time at home and less at work."
good,My hiring manager over time demonstrated no understanding of the software quality role and how it supports an organization. This led to my departure after a major presentation was dismissed without merit.
good,"As a dispatcher, you would deal with OTR drivers on a daily basis. some were nice but you could get some rude ones. Over all the environment was fun. Like any place you have pros. and cons."
good,"The people were great to work with. I had a great manager. The scheduling was a little flexible. But very long hours at work, and not enough money to hire enough people."
good,"Ok company just the people inside it make it worse, seems like there is a revolving door and they are not military friendly. They have terminated more than 2 military members. one was right before deployment."
good,"typical day was going in early AM  get on a hilo, do inspection of hilo. "
good,"It was a good place to work, however the office is full of lies and so are the management. They are not upfront with anyone."
good,Management is terrible. Terminal manager is a manipulator. Doesn't trust anybody. Very hard to work for.Supervisors are unqualified. They don't understand how to perform their everyday functions correctly.
good,come in to work some management good sector leaders demand a lot of negative feedback to employers did my job in whatever weather conditions were to the best of my ability learned how to be a better loader and unloader of trailers and forklift operator management listen sector leaders made impossible demands and negative feedback coworkers some good some bad the hardest part was staying 10hrs in freezing cold paycheck at the end of the week
good,Working at Conway is enjoyable but the hours of my shift are challenging.  Other than the hours the job was okay.  The work atmosphere was fair.
good,During my time at Conway Freight management often lacked communication skills with dockworkers and supervisors. Due to the lack of communication freight was often misplaced or damaged.
good,Good place to work but at the end of the day it is all about the numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. Soft management though.
good,"Generally a good place to gain experience in the transportation industry.  Advancement is available if you relocate.  However, local management is not backed."
good,"I managed the day to day operations dealing with employee concerns, schedules, costumer care, and operational needs. My team I managed was outstanding and committed to getting the job done everyday. The hardest part of my job was trying to make sure my employees had a home and work life balance. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with throughout my career."
good,"Standard call center duties. Management was fairly decent, let you do your job as long as you met quota. Good benefits. Compensation...OK."
good,I enjoyed my position as a Sales Associate in the Lingerie Department. I had excellent customer service skills. I enjoyed putting product on sales floor and helping people.
good,"Conway was like a warehouse for clothing from all over and it coulds be very crowed in tight spaces. I worked there in the summertime and the AC was broken. So the work place was very hot even the fans was blowing hot air. The store stay packed regardless, but it was alot of complaints from customers. So I dealt with negative attitudes from the public and co workers. I learned to be polite in any situation and it worked in my favor. I enjoyed working in the shoe department, and I didn't like that we couldn't leave the building for breaks."
good,"Work consisted of normal Freight Handling, loading unloading and transfer of freight.  Equipment was in good working order, and safety was a constant reminder.  Co-Workers and FOS's were great people and easy to work with .  Most everyone has the team attitude.  Mgmt literally could not speak the truth.  Constantly caught manager level supervisors giving lip service and then it was generally bad information in which they would not stand behind.  Great pay, good benefits, tons of hours you definitely earn your money."
good,"Questionable ethics and integrity. When I first started out at Con-Way it was by far the best paying job I had ever had, and as a female  "
good,Great co-workers but boss wasnt that great.  Good benifits but everyone was worried about their job or looking for another one.  Good work events.
good,"Conway freight Pasco, is a brand-new and state-of-the-art facility. Just like any company there are politics and when there's politics the morale of the staff is like a roller coaster. This is extremely hard, dirty and exhausting work. Over time it's expected of the dockworker regardless if your asked or not and the hourly wage along with over time is not enough to support a family who relies on a single income, but it beats unemployment. Benefits are not offered until after 90 days which are minimal once you hit one year and three months the employee is offered advanced and better health benefits. In the worst-case scenario once training is complete the dockworker would most likely work the night shift which consists of a eight hour schedule, but will be expected to work anywhere from 10 to 12 hours five days a week. Advancement is slow unless the dockworker is wanting obtain a CDL, which Conway freight provides the training and will be paid a dockworker's wage until completion of the CDL. Management is notorious to be favorable certain employees and also operate in a micromanaging manner, but one manager is very cooperative. This is a very high stressed work environment."
good,constantly changing procedures and ideas very difficult to keep up with and to stay focused on YOUR job working in all elements all hours of the day. I enjoy my co-workers and the ability to change my shift every year to maximize my hometime
good,"The company pays well and is still one of the highest paying ltl carriers.  While management is hit and miss they tend to focus on the trivial things instead of the more important.  Job security is great if you just show up however they will look for ways to get rid of you if they dont like you.  As for work and life balance, you will work 10-14 hours a day and you will never get a day off because the vacation is picked from the top down.  The people that have been there for 20 years have 8 weeks of vacation.  With that being said that driver and the following 150 drivers will pick EVERY week they want before you.  So be prepared to take vacations at ridicolous times and not seeing a christmas week off for 25 years."
good,Fast paced Co workers are fun management is okay they certified me to drive a forklift
good,"While you will make a very good living while working at Conway, you get no respect from mgmt in any way, shape or form.  They demand 12+ hrs from you with only one 30 minute break.  If anyone has worked there before, then you know its anything but a relaxed and easy going environment.  You're constantly threatened with your job if you don't want to work those long hours as well...having good morale at Conway is not going to happen and its something mgmt could care less about!  If you get past all of that, then Conway is a good place to work."
good,I learned a lot of information regarding the freight business in my time of employment there.
good,Worked here for 6
good,Competative company with good equipment and good training program.
good,"Great place to work, good people ,good pay , but ran poorly upper management needs help. They all need to start from being a loader to driver then management so they truly understand how things accually work to better understand the whole picture instead of just going by numbers !!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Con-way has begun the lean journey. Though there have been great strides, it is a long way from reaching full potential. Long hours are a constant state for anyone in a management position 10 hours is a daily average. In order to have a balance between work and home, home must be value time."
good,"Conway overall is a good company. If you face tough times, don't expect Conway to have compassion or be a help. I needed my retirement $ to save our home. I quit to cash out my 401K. I thought I left on good terms, but when I reapplied after a position opened up I was turned down."
good,"Although I was not completely aware of what the retail industry involved prior to working here, I adapted quite quickly to the day to day activity. I will say the slightly less positive outlook I have is due to the management at that time. The company as a whole has shown me nothing but compassion and helped me grow in knowledge."
good,"Got a van that could be used privately. Was in charge of around 20 men, had to sort out wages for them and work loads. Do have to work nights in some projects."
good,People are hired into management who have not been trained for management.  Some may or may not know the operation and sometimes it's learn as you go.  The managers need to be trained on how to communicate and handle people.
good,Typical day was high volume data entry of freight BOLs and high volume customer service calls to trace freight delivery and to quote freight delivery rates.
good,This was a good place to learn the trucking industry and the guys I worked with were great people. I enjoyed my time there. The hours sucked if you wanted a social  life.
good,Day to Day is the same typical work so once you build a routine the job gets easier and easier. You deal with the same customers daily. You have the choice wether to work as a P&D driver or as a line-haul driver over night. On the over night work you are pulling doubles to other terminals out of state and once you arrive you have to do dock work. You work longer hours but you also make more money.
good,Unorganized workplace but you eventually get the hang of things . met some pretty cool people.. Management was okay just cursed more than I'd take a liking to
good,"Working at conway was like any other job. As a driver, you start at the bottom doing tasks you really do not want to do. Sweeping the docks, trailers and dock skirt pads. Loading and unloading trailers and then if you were lucky to get a run, it would be a short trip to the next freight assembly center and unload/load trailers again. However, once you have proved yourself, tasks were more easy and the runs were longer to a more desirable location. In time, you would have an opportunity to go to city P&D."
good,It was a good place to work except for extreme weather and sometimes short and long days management was ok but sometimes show favoritism but co workers was great
good,"To advance in the company, you are expected to move anywhere in the country. This does not work for people with families."
good,"Working in extreme weather conditions, most of the drivers there helped me out alot to understand the ends and outs of LTL."
good,When I started at Conway it was a company a driver could make good money during the day in the city.  As the company changed from ccx to conway freight to xpo logistics that changed. I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with including the supervisors and management.
good,"Moved from JB Hunt to Con-way Freight because of the employee culture and the overall attitude of management towards people and the work/home balance. XPO took over in October and immediately laid off 600 people after stating they would not change anything within the first year.  Freight is slow the first of the year and within 3 weeks XPO had laid off another 190 people. No value placed on people with XPO, all about the bottom dollar and bodies are expendable.  Shame"
good,The management is terrible and there is no type of communication from the boss. They treat you like anything. The supervisors are pretty good and hard workers.
good,"My day started at 6 a.m. with a report on company revenue sent out to Operating unit presidents, Account and location coding of IT invoices, Various inquiries on Expense Statements or Invoice payments and approval.  I learned how to give customers internal and external the best service possible.  I also learned to accept everyone I worked with and with respect. The hardest part was juggling book close duties with high quantities of invoices to process.  The most enjoyable part of my job was researching and finding answers for managers and vendors."
good,When you are full-time you always know your start time for the most part but you never have a clue what time you will end. One day you might work 8hrs and the very next day you could put in 12hrs. As long as the work is complete management could care less how many hours you put in.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Conway. There is always something to you because there is a constant flow of customers from open to close. I worked with a great team because we support and assist each other.
good,"OK place to work, you have to be willing to deal with different conditions, its fasted paced. Management is ok, but like to micro manage alot."
good,"Shift starts and the employees retrieve a scanner, pick a trailer to unload. When scanning the product the scanner tells u the trailer to put freight in. Take freight to trailer and load"
good,"I was not happy here because I spent more time waiting at customers than driving. Some of the places they send you are not made for trucks. Once you are assigned a load, it is yours until you deliver it. I had to sit over the weekend I quit to deliver."
good,"Management in this company are mostly older not very friendly. "
good,"collega's waren top"
good,The people at this company was very nice to work with. The company ended up going out of business due to poor management decisions. The benefits provided by the parent company was outstanding.
good,"Load your gear on your lift, grab your work assignment(s), begin with the unloading or loading of freight via cross dock; in addition reorganizing the freight for an optimal load-out in the trailer.  Roughly a 10hr day each day.  30min lunch.  What I learned I'm not proud to talk about other than operating a fork truck & freight bracing & placement.  Don't make friends with Co-workers just keep it to an acquaintance.  The hardest part is re-cooping damaged freight due to pallet destruction/physically augmenting freight placement.  The most enjoyable thing about my job was going home everyday & getting paid weekly."
good,"as a mechanic you have many responsibilities,janitor,partsman,receptionist,trainer.too many rules!and srt jobs are timed jobs and difficult to obtain.conway has good pay and benefits.and if your not the bosses buddy you will do the worst work like tailer work even though your a truck mechanic!Im sure not all bosses are like ours,at least i hope not!"
good,"Conway was a nice place to work. The managers for the most part was ok in certain situations. For the work that we performed and the equipment we used. I think the managers should have been more considerate of the driver. The workers at Conway was a descent group of guys who didn't mind helping or sharing information that was needed to become a successful driver at Conway. A typical work day for me was to come in and unload/load trailers, run my appointments and some times run a route. The hardest part of the job was to come in on Sunday night at 8-10 pm. I truly enjoyed working at Conway. I finally got kind of use to the Sunday night and was able to adjust. I really enjoyed meeting my customers and delivering freight to them. I learned that if I took everyday for what it was and do my job to the best of my ability that my day would run ok."
good,Con-way Truckload provided good equipment which met all the required DOT FMCSA regulations. Dispatchers always available and friendly and willing to work with the truckers. Terminals were always kept clean and showers provided. Management were very understanding and always will to help within there means. Runs were very practical and fair. Plenty of information to improve or advance on health. Very trucker orientented.
good,Nothing to say good about Con-way. No job security at all
good,"The pay and benefits were pretty standard. The management team tried hard, but often didn't understand the issues facing the drivers on the road. Equipment was good. One day of home time earned for every seven on the road."
good,I would deliver freight by tractor trailer to different local business and some traveling on weekends
good,"During my 7 year tenure, I saw significant shifts in direction of company, as well as goals and strategy. Company is on the path to success with a heavy focus on Lean, but management and supervisory staff is well undercompensated with their ""total rewards"" package - leading to job dissatisfaction and retention issues."
good,We left when Con-Way sold out to XPO. It used to be a pretty good place to work. I wish we had remained company drivers though. Stepping up to owner/operator was a mistake. Lesson learned the hard way.
good,It felt like a family until the sale to XPO. It seems like everyone is a number not a person. I enjoy what I do until they make it  impossible to meet goals.
good,Ok leadership and the technology is good. They are cut throat and do not play favorites. If you do not kiss up the right manager then it will be tough.
good,"Its a ok company, but had no room to grow.  Barely got in 8 hours a day of work.  Doesn't offer 401k, stocks or pension options.  Great lack of communication."
good,"Very caring, understanding, helpful staff. Paid vacation good family time. Paid fairly. Great hours and travel times. All that changed with management and the sale of the company several times."
good,The company had to many bosses telling people what to do and that created a great deal of conflict for the employees to manage. There was games played using employees as pawns.
good,The company was in the processing of being acquired by another company during the time that I was there. Employees were all feel unstable during that time.
good,"good ltl company to work, for fast paced and busy."
good,Great company to work for as I came in with limited experience in the LTL business. Local management was GREAT to work for and they cared about you as a person.
good,Not the best place to work as a temp employee.Job was not as challenging and morale was low. The company name has changed now  and Conway was bought out.
good,"Hours worked were not desirable.  However, the job was fine and the people were even better to work with.  Direct supervisor was not fun to work for though."
good,greate company to wok for but unfortunately the company is sold to a different company and meanwhile i relocated from NY and back to my home town in connecticut.
good,You will work tons of hours but the money is really good. Most the people are friendly. If you don't like to work over time don;t go to work here. If you do not mind ovetime yhr money is well worth it.
good,I did not work here very long.  I was injured shortly after being hired.  I was sent out to pick up a shipment from a company and was not given a pallet jack to be able to pick up the product.
good,This job was very fast paced and busy.  As I was the outbound dispatcher for the busiest region in the United States my day was filled to the brim with activity.
good,Day to day work was good the management was good and fair the hardest part of the job was the heat because I worked on the dock the most enjoyable part about the job was the pepole who worked with me it was a company with great faces
good,while working at Conway i did a lot of product replenish.and learned that you can make alot of money from used material.the management switched alot.we had fun at the workplace and it was alot of positivity. the hardest part of the job was closing. and the best part was seeing the babies
good,"jobs alright management can use some help, during the winter its really cold, kinda high stress because of the different size freight you need too load"
good,"Worked there for 8 months they rarely ever got me out of the nort east despite my requests to do so, and then my wife got pregnant and it caused me to need more home time so I had to get a different job."
good,same as above there is no room for advancementdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I was a part of a good team. I met good people and the work was not hard. They try and do a lot of thing for the empolyees.
good,my job was to load and unload freight onto and off the truck set up the trailers racking system. To load truck tight and efficient.
good,A little slow paced but ok overall. Did not have a chance to work with management but never had a problem. They give very few hours which is a con and cut hours constantly
good,Loading and Unloading Semi Trucks with forklifts as well as hand pallet jacks.  Wrapping freight. Ensuring all Safety measures were met and always being aware of surroundings due to Forklift Traffic.
good,"The people you work with are great and very helpful."
good,"Great people to work with, fast paced environment with a accuracy to the job. Shipping items all around the country. Great people and great benefits."
good,"Cant really give an honest review of this company seeing as how i did not work there for very long. For what time i was there, it was a good paying and reliable place of employment."
good,"Con-Way is a typical logistics company. There are good days and bad. My overall experience was positive......the management had strict deadlines, as many jobs do and this could cause very difficult confrontations."
good,They have constant layoffs. Overwork their staff. A terrible place to work. I worked in Enterprise Architecture until they eliminated the dept. I worked toward LEAN certification until they eliminated the program.
good,"Most typical days would start by working on the dock,sometimes all day long. When I did get out on the street, it was for local p&d around Aurora and surrounding ares.I often did spotting in the Conway yard. and whatever other duties they would assign to me."
good,The work space at the terminal is limited. The forklift traffic becomes very hectic when the drivers are in the building to assist in the handling of freight.
good,"I started out with the best bunch of guys that anyone would want to work with. Moved up the ladder to take on the Bismarck, ND location and those guys were also a great bunch, but when I moved back to Ohio to work at the Cincinnati terminal, that was a whole other world. (for the bad)"
good,"Supervisors are required to work a 10 hour day, many times this can turn into a 12-15 hour day.  Con-way has many great ideas but the pass down from the top to bottom delivery can be overwhelming."
good,"Operate commercial and non-commercial vehicles in a safe and efficient manner. "
good,"Need to pay employees more.  "
good,"Worked in many different capacities during my five years at Con-Way and was promoted three times to positions of greater responsibility. Over two years within the operations realm and three working in a Human Resource capacity where I was directly responsible for all H/R functions of over 150 employees. Which primarily consisted of Handling payroll; performance reviews; discrimination complaints; interviewing, hiring and scheduling all hourly positions; employee morale and performance; workers compensation inquiries; health and medical insurance enrollment and inquiries. Provide training for new hires and re-training for employees to ensure employees are following company standards and policies. Coordinated many external functions within the community in both a support and volunteer capacity."
good,A typical day here was using a forklift to load and unload trucks. pre tripping and post tripping trucks and delivering products to the customer in a time sensitive manner. the co workers were fun and easy to get along with because you have a lot to relate with them.  There management was young and didn't know the driver lifestyle so there was no common ground. The hardest part about this job was it was a long commute to work. The easiest part about this job was working overtime.
good,"it was a cery good palce to work. "
good,Drive my own truck to haul Conway Truckload loads to all 48 states. They are a very good company to work for.
good,can make some good money through the company. as a temp you have to be real cautious of what you do but once your full time your good
good,"To work assigned accounts, deal with shipping issues and making sure that each bill that is sent out is correct."
good,Co-workers are friendly. Work long hours. Management sometimes doesn't care for there employees.
good,"Con-way was a good company to work for - one which provided opportunities for advancement.  The work-life balance was challenged at times given the demands of the job, as well as the industry."
good,"Hourly wages good"
good,if your looking for home time forget it. they don't care if or when you get home..............
good,"A typical day for me would be to come in the afternoon and set up my plan for the night. As my team of employees come in later in the day, they start to unload the freight from the trailers and load it into the trailers going to the night service centers. My day ends when all the freight is loaded and the drivers on their way."
good,Always changing. Constant changes in management and processes.
good,Position was a overnight shift and it was difficult with a newborn at the time.
good,"The hours are long but there is job security and promotions, as long as your willing to move."
good,worked with a lot of great people. Basically I just need to get out of trucking. Im not happy driving for a living anymore. There's more traffic and laws are becoming ridiculously stringant.
good,I worked on a dock driving a forklift in all weather conditions. My co-workers were ok and to busy to converse. I had a deadline to meet everyday.
good,"load trailers for outbound deliver,management is decent to work for ,good co-workers to work with,the hardest part of job is adjusting to the weather its hot in summer time and cold in winter time because its on a dock with no air or heat and the most enjoyable part is doing a job well done"
good,A typical day at work is busy there is always something to do or something to improve on. I learned that team work is very important. Management could use an overhaul. The co-workers are fun and interesting and are a hard working group of people. The hardest part of the job is getting the group and management on the same track. The enjoyable part is working and functioning as a team and reaching set goals also fellowship with the co-workers.
good,"Typical Trucking Company.  I worked for them 3.5 years. Located in Joplin, MO."
good,A supervisor postion at Conway is great way to learn management in a supply chain setting.
good,it was okay they where okay for me not sitting alot i liked that.... never really understood just about every time you would call your fleet manager they always seem stressed out  and didn't feel like they would want to talk thats how they made me feel
good,Not to customer friendly to work there. I would go above and beyond to please a dissatisfied customer outside my reach thinking problem solved my level didn't reach the completion of problem solved. I was always the first to know the problem and the last to know it had been solve.
good,"enjoyed working with team, especially loved the floor projects setting up the store."
good,This was a good company to work for. They had a great company store and nice driver facilities. There was very poor communication between managment and drivers.
good,"As a cashier I handle different transaction at the cash wrap. I assist customer  with questions, at closing time we all go on the selling floor to help. The hardest part for me was when they transfer me to another store and there the budget was low. After that I only worked 21 and 27 hrs and I am a fulltime person. Managers always around,but besides that I enjoy my job."
good,"Con-way was a great place to work, I was going through a rough time in my life and had to leave.  Only 1 major downfall about Con-way was work and life balancing; you're never home."
good,This job provided for my family and made it possible (and necessary) to attend nursing school.
good,"Compensation / Benefits great"
good,This job is Slave labor. The managers don't know what they are doing half the time and I am surprized no one gets injured daily. You are not allow to go home until they tell you so expect at least 12+ hour days every day.
good,just another workplace with good and bad coworkers
good,"fast pace, i learn how to be reliable and what it takes to run a retail store, people disappointing you more. overtime"
good,"Good company to wok for. safety culture is king. Wonderful dispatch, however not enough miles. good place to start though."
good,My day useally began at night i worked with suppervisers to see what was the goal for the night wheather it was working on the dock to get the freight off the floors and loaded into the trailers they needed to be to get it shipped off or hooking sets for drivers that needed to do a quick turn around or taking a line run to its destination or just worked in the yard as hostler moving trailers around to different dock doors i was universal and did it all including P&D loads.And the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing i had a safe productive day and came home to my family with a smile every day.
good,I have no issues with conway they are a decent place to work and the new hire process was enjoyable.
good,Very high pace outbound shifts.
good,"A typical day at Conway Freight depended on sales, customers, and managment."
good,Report in - work dock. Check in with dispatch. Pick up bills and schedule. Proceed to pick ups and deliveries.
good,"Conway was a better company to work for. XPO bought Conway and everyone feels like a number not like family. With Conway, the bonus was base on the company making money. With XPO, each service center now has goals that are unattainable to hit bonuses."
good,"It a job you can take charge and use your brain to complete the job. "
good,"The company really showed that it cared about it's employee. Although the company moved it's operations out of California, it provided a great severance package"
good,"Its not a great company but not too bad. Good trucks, dispatchers are like everywhere else, attitude attitude. Raises come yearly, safety bonus, and good health insurance"
good,Very structured environment with defined policies and procedures which made it easy to gauge your own performance based on company expectations and guidelines.
good,"hard working day but worth it, you'll clocking in find your forklift get your assignment to which door you going to unload when finish with that you'll get assigned another truck"
good,If it is 14 degrees below 0 outside it will be just as cold inside. Was a great job for a person with good blood circulation like a younger man but I almost got trench foot and the doctor told me if I did not quit he was going to have to amputate my left foot!!
good,Loved Conway XPO is headed in a different direction. Tying to become smaller which means they are very overstaffed and rarely good a full day.
good,"The company was very great to work for. You get to meet a wide variety of people. It's close knit. However, they should have a mandatory training for management 3 times a year."
good,Con-way was a second job I took on to supplement my income for the summer. I like the fast pace and action there. The only thing that I did not like was group meeting where they were always talking about writing people up.
good,"Overall good management"
good,The company put to much importance in performance numbers that it made co-workers upset with each other. The poor attitudes created an unsafe environment. I was lucky to come out of there in one piece.
good,"Con-Way was a good company with good benefits. I appreciated the culture of the Company. Communications at times seemed to be lacking, but in general they tried to do the right thing by their people."
good,"The management was nice and caring. Typical day unload and load truck until they are all done. Co-workers were all nice for the most part, some drivers were not the nicest."
good,"Great place to work. Top notch equipment, hot days the management would put out coolers full of water for the dock workers. Cold days, they would take shifts pulling people into the office to warm up. Always had company picnics and events for the workers and their families!"
good,very hard work with plenty of opportunity to advance if you are willing to stick it out. set schedule in supervisor role at 10 hour days. constantly busy with high efficiency expectations.
good,"you work on the dock, when you arrive at your destination and then you work on the dock in all inclimates of weather"
good,"Working in the personnel office consisted of never knowing what each day would bring, Monday through Friday.  When your job is all about helping employees with benefits, workplace issues, major life events, celebrations, etc., you have to be flexible."
good,"it seems that conway freight is a great company to work for but if you do not possess a 4  year degree or know someone in upper management you cannot promote with the company.  They are also one of the cheapest paying companies when it comes to hourly employees and salary."
good,"Conway Freight is a Good place to work if you want to start a career in transportation, they have very good training methods for all employees, the enviroment is very fast paced since Conway Freight is one of the leading transportation companys in the U.S.A."
good,"It was a productive place to work,you have too be ready for whatever the customers need you to help them with.wheather they were mean to you or not,plus keep a smile on at all times.the most part is the customers. the hardes part is not getting enough hours , all in all i like when the customers tell the managers how you help them in finding what they need an more"
good,The bad thing was being through the temp place and watching people get friends in right out the door making more then me who was through the temp. It took me more then 2 years to get a interview.  I stayed all the time for OT and missed 2 days in 2 years.
good,Les journées de travail étaient agréables dans une bonne ambiance
good,"I was a supervisor of approximately 300 employees so I developed management skills which I had previously lacked in this role. In addition, I developed negotiation skills."
good,I work in the parts department for a great boss. He saw something in me when I interviewed with him 11 years ago. He gave me chance. I have mixed emotions an all the things taking place and no room for advancement anymore.
good,Me gustaba mi trabajo pero no pertecia a la empresa era un programa de recién graduado
good,could be a great place to work if management would do their jobs a little better. Need to be more aggressisve toward drivers
good,"The job is fairly easy and pays well but management is very removed from the actual work that's being done.  Bad decisions are made on what our hours should be or changes to the job because of this. If you work as a supervisor on the dock, expect long hours. Drivers also work long hours."
good,"My first few months were very enjoyable. Loved the atmosphere, coworkers etc. Then Conway was bought and everyone changed and no everything is so political in that department, I barely want to be there. I learned a lot of things working in this field, but the management team makes it unbearable"
good,"What I liked most about working for Conway was that it taught me how to persevere under pressure, to stay strong when things get rough, and how to lead others. "
good,"I've been with Conway Freight via contract work through a temporary agency, and I am in no way authorized to give my in-detail description of a review for this company. In-detail, because it is more respectful opposed to partial detail. Therefore N/A at this time."
good,"Young talent is given a chance to advance. But, due to limited training and development budgets, proper grooming is not available. Competitive in the industry and decent place to work."
good,I Karen enjoy's working for this company due to the fact that I love to work with the public and get to help others in there needs if possible I have been into the retail business for quit some time and I'm willing to put in effort into trying different working positions beacause i make the best in everything i do and also told to do.
good,"Looking at 60 hour weeks, forced overtime and hours. You come in when they tell you to, you leave when they release you. "
good,They have a good training program for entry level employees but as you progress the training is lack luster at best
good,It's A good company if you like to run hard and use up all your hours
good,I was harassed almost daily when I was a new hire by this supervisor and HR was extremely rude and unhelpful. I felt very uncomfortable there and I wanted out. Beside that it would have been a great place to work with great pay and benefits which I'm sure it is at other locations. This is based off my own personal experience with a couple very unprofessional management personal at this location.
good,The bad thing about working on the docks at a freight company is it you're not paid time and a half for overtime other than that they provide many hours
good,Conway presented me with a great opportunity to learn outside sales. I was familiar with inside sales but didn't have the outside sales experience. Conway had a great training program and I was very good with the customers.
good,Aprendi a utilizar paypro atencion al cliente buen ambiente
good,"Start a 5 am unload trucks/load trucks out for  the city.go to lunch,then head on for city deliveries.How to use handheld computer. some management was ok. some co-worker worked some did not,doing other coworks work."
good,I liked it but not enough home time.I just didnt like not being home at all currently in seperation process over it.People were great to work for and it is a awesome and friendly invironment to work in.
good,Management will make sure that you have a productive day and will not hesitate to move you if they deem you to be slacking off.
good,"it pays the bills, and support for my family its an ok place to work"
good,"Transporting freight"
good,one of my favorite jobs. management were laid back and friendly. t-con paper work and clean dock. arrive drivers and help managers if needed
good,my job was fine most of the time also i gained at lot of extras through some of mangement and coworkers
good,Con-Way Freight has a very strong Culture after adopting LEAN. They also have very concrete values and a long history in the Freight Industry. They also have very high expectations and place a lot of value on their scorecard which is how each terminal is graded against the next. As a supervisor you will be placed on a shift where you will directly effect the placement of your terminal on the scorecard. Your stress will skyrocket and depending on your terminal's hours you will often have to work til midnight and 1am after coming in at noon.
good,"The training was great and so was the management. They took pride in their employees and it showed with advancements, compensation and the overall way you were treated as an employee."
good,"This trucking company, like so many others, was very much a closed community and difficult to socially integrate with, but the people were ALL polite and professional."
good,"Incoming call extremely busy, learned a lot about transportation, importance of delivery. Learning customer is always right and never loose your cool."
good,"Nice work pace, a lot of team work involved. Management is mediocre. Hardest part of the job is the weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the learning of freight."
good,"Con-way was a great place to work.  A typical day was always busy, as there was freight coming in from US and all over Canada.  All co-workers were awesome, everyone had all work assessed accordingly.  The hardest part was learning to deal with the US side of the business being a Canadian.  The best part of the job the data entry, as always."
good,I had to do mark downs merchandise cloths on the floor help customer with what ever they was looking for and handling money on a daily basic
good,I like dealing with customers on a day to day base. Balancing the general ledger. Running the weekly report.
good,"It was a productive logistics company, and I quit to become a truck driver. it was nice at first driving an hour back and fourth, then it became difficult for me. I left to further my training with Waukesha county technical college."
good,This was a Great place to work it was like a family business I loved what I did and was very disappointed when the acquisition took place in November when XPO took over and the Job eliminations started the whole vibe of the company changed dramatically and my job was eliminated in January after 18 years.
good,"They told me how much work they had, then when I changed jobs for them, they only worked me 10 to 20 hrs a week."
good,"Everything is good at my job the are very responsible, respectful, goal motivated, honest, helpful and the company is big on safety and customer satisfaction"
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a great nursing home and had great staff. Working as a team was key and we did that. The CNAs had to be able to get along and sometimes that didn't happen. Everyone tried to take everyone's job.
good,Explored the lower 48 states and Canada.  It was nice to drive.  I ran teams with my ex wife and it was fun going from one side of the country to the other in a day or so.
good,"Dispatched,and processed company work orders and billing receipts."
good,I was hired as a temp. They needed to fill their receptionist position but they did not want to hire anybody on as full time. They wanted to continue using temps.
good,Job was very stressful and even though it was indoors winters were brutal since bay doors were open and wind and weather was allowed to go through building.
good, Trained new hires on register and store procedures
good,they were good to work for as long as you deal with your dispatcher not larado dispatch that also does el paso. they do not care about you they just want to use you to do there dropped loads by teams.
good,I loved my jobs and enjoyed them very much that were assigned to me! I worked my way up very quickly but most of the management at Conway is under par and inappropriate at the work place. But that aside I loved working there and loved what I did there.
good,load and unload truck. management treats you very poorly. co workers were fun to be around. hardest part is working with hardly any breaks.
good,"My job was usrally 60-70 hrs a week  Long nights starting at midnight going to 2 o’clock in the afternoon! Also had to pull doulbles,sometime with hazmat"
good,"Good pay but the work is stressful and very fast paced, unless you have been there for several years and know how to work the system. Worked the dock more than you drive loading and unloading freight in all types of weather, you might work a dock 6 hours out of your 8-10 hour day. Usually after working a week had to rest for a day and a half just to be able to work on Monday very exhausting job."
good,somewhat a good place to work for you have to start form the bottom and work your way just like everyone else. every annually they give bonuses
good,"great drivers . working with all the people at Conway was a honor.people do not leave companies, they leave management. I will miss all of the great times we had."
good,"A typical day at work was always productive for me because there was always something to do. When I arrived to work, i clocked in and started putting new items out for display. Putting new items out on the sales floor included: hanging, folding, and pricing. Afterwards, i would either be placed on the cash register or help to maintain the store in a clean environment. Sometimes, a supervisor in my department wouldn't show up, so it was up to me to do everything. I learned how to multitask, remain an employee and still be in charge at the same time. In my opinion, i don't think there was a hard part for me; but the most enjoyable part was helping customers find what they need while getting to do what i love."
good,"Great pay, great guys to work with. Easy money for someone looking to work a odd schedule. Advancement is nearly non existent."
good,"Conway is a professional company and  tries to meet driver needs.  the inherent difficulties of ""living on a truck have forced me to seek a more local driving experience with more home time."
good,"I've been working with con-way for about two and half years and do enjoy working there. The atmosphere there is good very fast pace and very little room for error time is critical there because frieght has to go at a certain time. My co-workers and I have built a great comradery. I cant say nothing bad I definitely learned alot about freight companys and cubing trailers out, following DOTs procedures and properly loading trailers."
good,"Con-Way truckload is the best full time OTR company to work for. The starting pay is ok with very reliable dispatchers. Like most OTR companies you don't get a lot of home time, and the benefits aren't really great. Management is pretty good and culture values are decent. "
good,"There were many benifits to working at Con-way Truck Load, You learn quick to ""CYA"". They are one of the better Mega Carriers. The miles are decent. Paid XM radio. "
good,"busy everyday 7 days a week and hoildays,management was always there when you need them, the job place was like family enthusiastic,professional,dependable,and organized."
good,It's okay it was a job... excellent job fair amount of management experience with the work requires. I goal-oriented and move to a team-player job I did like that job just not enough time to say to much though
good,Work /life balance while I was there was great. As with any small business there were multiple hats you needed to wear on a daily basis. People were good to work with.
good,"Excellent pay once you are out of the training periods required for all new hire employees. Poor management however they tend to leave you alone if you do your job properly. No home life, they rarely can get you home on the days you request."
good,"Conway has tested its employees and myself. This job requires great coordination, and psychical ability. The hours are very long, as we work overnight and sometimes into the day. The pay is great because they always need workers that can do a long shift. Its often cold and because of how much psychical labor done, most are hungry so the breaks are used to eat. for long term employees the benefits are great but leaves little room for advancement. Its a hard job for hard workers."
good,"A day a Con-Way, usually consist of getting a handheld unit from the front office, and moving freight, with a forlkift being the main mode of transport up and down the dock."
good,"commercial collections of past due freight bills,the hardest thing to do was the re-rating of damaged freight bills and resolving customers claims of freight damage, the only thing that we were able to do was recommending removal of credit from the customer if applicable. It was very slow and methodical and there was absolutely no room to move up with in the company."
good,good paying and a nice place to work but consistency of work is unreliable
good,"great group of guys to work with, fast pace enviroment, a lot of hours"
good,"I had a good work expereince with the company, I started out with not a lot of hrs, but as time past my work abilities allowed the staff to call me in for extra hrs when co workers called out or if they needed me to come in befor my work schedule."
good,"This company was my first trucking job, they had good training program.i learned how to handle myself on the road, I also appreciate the pay that I made at this company."
good,Needs better management and dispatchers. the miles where ok and they do get you home when asked. I was a super regional Texas driver but they tend to send you out of boundaries to get you miles but I was ok with that.
good,"Managed a number of location over many years, Did the hiring process with the help of HR and Firing Process with HR. I the mouthpiece for the company to guide employees"
good,Good work place enjoyed working under management. I was able to build my experience. I was able to do many types of work there not only truck driving.
good,Con-way Freight provides training by the corporate office and by local management.  Con-way Freight recognizes hard work by shift parties. I learned that I should have stayed with Con-way Freight and not worried about relocation.
good,"The place was pretty great to work at. I was never short on work how ever they tend to bounce you from over night to day time, which to me personally isn't easy to adjust to."
good,"Before Conway was sold to XPO, they were an excellent company.  XPO screwed up the company, and then luckily for the employees, XPO sold them to another company."
good,"los días allí eran entretenidos y se trabaja en buen ambiente hay compañerismo, "
good,"i start my day at 2am wording the dock loading and unloading trailers for 4 hours the move into the front office to help answer phone and help customers for 2-3 hours then 2 hours in meetings checking on projects with project leaders then 4-6 hours driving delivering freight to customers. learned a lot with excel and power point, cross dock and exporting freight to Canada and managing multiple teams on strict deadlines."
good,"Good work place and clean environment. Not many oppurtinities given , and hours. Great partime job , but not fulltime. Benefits are ok ."
good,"Good company, good people.  Newer equipment, well maintained.   In transition due to XPO Logistics buyout of Conway.  Dispatchers stretched thin due to XPO letting a lot of them go along with other management."
good,"Great place to work. Very fast paced environment, makes the time go by faster. Working outside can be tough in summer hours but still a great place."
good,"co-workers were helpful and fun to work with, also learned how to load a trailer quick for the city drivers. The hardest part of the job was the gate times for Line haul. I have nothing bad to say about management."
good,Long hours in dusty operating conditions. The culture of the company rewards those who choose to work the smartest. good place to work overall.
good,Conway freight is a good place to start at if you are looking to get your feet wet in the transportation business. There are locations all around the country to help advance in your career.
good,Great safety and control of work. comfortable work space. Helpful people. loading and unloading of trucks. staying within out times. cleaning and maintaining a clean and safe dock. safety testing forklifts
good,"Decent pay but hard to get a regular work schedule,  Co-workers where great to work with."
good,"I worked at Con-way Freight for over 15 years. They are a leader in the LTL industry and a good company to work for."
good,I  learned a lot about the freight business and really perfected my forklift driving skill there. I enjoyed the people I worked with and around. The only complaint I can say about Con-Way is the upper management.
good,"Very good company. Be prepared to move, a lot if you want to work towards C-level."
good,Took good care of their employees and value family above normal.
good,I am hard working and I come do my job and if asked to do more I will  do. I like working with people who have the same ambition I have. The  hardest part of my job is leaving early because we are slow. the most enjoyable part of the job I get to do what I like to do.
good,Fast Paced work enviornment. good management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to complete the jobs in the time that was needed for the truck drivers to be efficient at their job.
good,"I drove over the road, picked up and delivered regularly. Nice paying salary."
good,not enough miles.  Left sitting for sometimes days and then getting a small run.  Was hard to manage my bills and responsibilities because of this.
good,"Answering inbound calls, entering data to generate documents, assist with dispatching of drivers, billing, imaging company documents for company revew."
good,A typical work day consisted of loading and unloading turcks.
good,"I was a Temporary employee that was awaiting to be hired permenant. While i was there, i gained experience in the cross dock shipping industry. I enjoyed it there because it was very busy and productive. I worked with contracted trucking companies and provided customer service to them. However, managment personel, the ones in charge over me, failed to communicate with me to let me know my assignment was coming to an end. I didnt know until 2 days before it ended and it was my temp agency that informed me, not the management.  The communication there is very unstasfactory.. This i see in the way each department works, instead of communicating with eachother, it was you had to find out for your self."
good,"A typical day for me is pickup and deliver cargo on time. If help is needed with a load or some time of help is required I contact my despatcher. After every load I complete a log book for DOT purposes. Working here at Conway Truckload I have learned that it is very important that I pickup and deliver every load on time and not a minute late. I have never been late on a load but was told the consequences if a load was to be late. I am a solo driver so if I see any of my  co-workers it would be at a truck stop and/or rest area for a short period time and gone again. The hardest part about this job is driving in the bad weathers; like snow storms, rain storms, and high windy areas. You must stay focused and always alert at all times. Lost of accidents happen over the road and its get a little overwhelming seeing other trucks in accidents. But overall I manage the job well. The most enjoyable part of the job is going through the different states. I live in Florida and I have never been out of the state until I began my career in trucking. For the most part I love what I do."
good,Each collector had their own portfolio to work.  Loved the flexible hours.
good,They were understanding to me needing off early or coming in late due to school and homework. Overall they are a great company.
good,"really enjoyed the job, however my 5yr old, didn't like me being over the road!"
good,"I enjoyed working at con-way"
good,"Driving OTR delivering goods to distributors across the US."
good,A typical day at work is to go out and drive freight to and from customers in a time efficient manner. I learned quickly that I wanted to be in sales and the management team was a solid team to work for. My co-workers are the best part of the job and everyone treats each other like family. The hardest part of the job is having to work close to 70 hours a week but the most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and the comradery.
good,I learned how to load a 53 footer trailer and how to secured hazardous material. My co-workers we always work helping each other good team work. Management was good they just wanted the job done and safe. The hardest part of the job was working nights 12 to 14 hours shifts and staying awake. The most enjoyable was when management reward and told u what a excellent job you done.
good,Outbound team works hard to get the job done for the night. Forklift driving to load and unload trailers.
good,Basically the trucking industry is uniform across the board in its work week and days off. You work 70-80 hours a week to earn a single day off it's easy work but don't plan on having a family. A typical work day consists of well driving 11 hours a day. There are stops at the customer maneuvering in traffic. You get to see the country from the freeway but you don't get to stop and see the sights. My co worker is my co driver he's a great guy but he misses his family. That in itself is the hardest part of the job. Your away from home for six weeks and you might get a few days at home.
good,I liked working there because of the people. The co-workers were great. The only part I didn't like that it was also a temp. position.
good,"Picking up and delivering frieght, working frieght on dock and breaking and loading trailers."
good,i was not recieving enough hours at this xompany if this issue could have been resolved i would continue working for them
good,Very productive and dependable person...A very caring company
good,"Busy admin for Finance department and Facilities Manager.  Very fast paced, but also relaxed environment.  Large corporate office.  The hardest part of the job was understanding the expectations of the Facilities Manager"
good,"The environment of the job could certainly be stressful at times, especially due to cut backs made by the corporate office. However, the job in many ways was rewarding with great pay and benefits."
good,"Con-way was the sort of job that held your vacation/ sick time over your head. They had free lunch for perfect attendance once upon a  time, but quit that. I did get to know an array of stupendous people…and learned the solidarity of a good working group as managers were a dime a dozen."
good,"You're always moving, pulling stuff off the trucks, putting stuff on the trucks. If you are not moving you are in the way, this makes the time fly by. Before you know it's it's lunch time or you're on your way home. Great atmosphere and good crew all around you all the time."
good,"Work in the fast linehaul department for 31 years, helped development the freight-flow plans for national LTL markets and maintained the nationwide flow of freight. Grew with the company from 1.7 million pounds a day to 100,000,000 lbs system wide per day"
good,I had a wonderful time driving for Conway Truckload before they were bought out by xpo. After the were bought out i heard alot of rumors of people leaving the company.
good,"Overall a fair  place to work in comparison to other companies and some similarities.A very demanding career and you will always be learning something new,for as things are always changing."
good,"This has been a great company to work for, recently purchased by XPO. We look forward to a great synergistic alliances. We look forward to a growth in the the amount of freight moved. XPO has a great customer basin and had many tools to provide end to end movement for any size company."
good,"Good company to to work for, can be difficult to find a work life balance with the hours of work and the time of work. Pay is good and management is like any large corporation or business."
good,"While employed with Con-Way, I learned a great deal about the trucking industry. They invest in training and want to make you successful."
good,LTL trucking company. Job expectations are well explained. Good working atmosphere. Great team work. Beverages are supplied to replenish you during hot temperatures. Wonderful benefits.
good,"Worked with various departments to resolve technical issue.  Placed service calls to IBM for Unix RS6000 issues, both software and hardware problems.  Reported system problems to development support group and took corrective action per their recommendations.  Assembled document canning workstations and supported them remotely and by phone once deployed to field locations."
good,"Management made this a nice place to work, however; they were unable to pay office staff what they deserved for the work performed."
good,Education is under valued at Truckload and talent often leaves as a result.  However the culture is shifting but I'm not sure it will advance in time to keep me either.
good,"Con-Way Truckload is one of the few large trucking companies that actually cares about their drivers and treats them with respect. Any issues that ever arose were handled swiftly and to my satisfaction. They pay slightly less than some companies, but the other benefits they offer (pet, rider policy, home time, etc.) more than make up for that. They always got me home within 7 days of requesting time off, was allowed to drive the truck home, and could take as many consecutive days off as you earned. They run you as hard as you want and I was able to average 2,200 miles a week with some weeks hitting as high as 4,000 miles."
good,"I worked in logs which is rules and regulations. I ran reports on the drivers and then called each one that was in violation and spoke with them documenting their response. Depending on the number or seriousness of the violation I would bring the driver in and give a disciplinary action that went to the supervisor with her recommendation to retrain or terminate. I had to mediate between Safety, the drivers, and operations at times to find out if the driver could run or had to stay put. My job also included training the drivers on the new elog system and to pass out awards for million mile and above drivers. I attended safety meetings once a month to provide photographs to the drivers for new badges."
good,"you can make good money here but work the dock alot,good people to work with"
good,The company is a key player in the LTL market.  They offer a competitive compensation package with good benefits.  Through my employment I enjoyed a variety of responsibilities.  Positions are bid as in a union shop without a union being present.  I enjoyed how that offered a variety of job responsibilities and added knowledge and growth.
good,"Each day was different . Sometimes good , and sometimes bad . For the most part management seemed to be very good . Sometimes the hardest part of the job was to keep freight together , so that it would arrive at the same destination on time."
good,"Pleasant work enviroment, very good and caring company. Chose to leave because they hired to many drivers.Therefore no room for advancement"
good,"LOVED this place!!!! Not the best management while I was working there, but the pay was great, benefits weren't bad, and they promote and hire within the company. Pretty awesome co-workers, very professional drivers. I would go back if given the opportunity."
good,"Fast paced environment. Sometimes stressful, but great experience."
good,"Day day short. I didn't learn really nothing, Management needed work. My co-workers were not very business like. The enjoyable part of my was the drivers and especially the customers."
good,"Like I said if your single, or have an understanding wife go for it!!!"
good,"this job was ok, but it had its days when it was really nothing to do there."
good,"Con-way was purchased, the new owners decided to consolidate branches. Our branch was chosen to close. My husband was since offered a new position, one in which we could move and be closer to our children"
good,"inside of the 10 years that I spent working with Conway, I learned a great deal of respect for forklift operations and Cross Dock operations. I billion my job highly and was very recognized is a competent City Driver by both peers and customers alike. in the end all, when it boiled down to it, it was management which desecrated the likeness of the company itself."
good,"Good pay for 2005 -  $.44/mile and $18.50/hr. on the dock with a forklift. Did line haul from Steamboat Springs, CO to Denver, CO and back every night. Management sucked at Henderson (Denver) - total jerks - and the other driver/loaders treated us Steamboat people like we worked for another company because we were managed out of California - Con-Way Western Express. I have never been so poorly treated by people within my own company as I was treated at Henderson by other Con-Way employees. When management refused to give us a 2 drive axle truck for Winter I gave a 2 week notice and quit. We had to go over 2 mountain passes, past a big reservoir, and through Eisenhower Tunnel on I-70 in the Rocky Mountains with double 28' pup trailers (wiggle wagons). Otherwise Con-Way seemed like a pretty decent company in spite of the people at the distribution center in Henderson (Denver)."
good,"This company was bought in late 2015 and underwent major management changes.  While change brings a new perspective the core values of this company changed along with the purchase.  Safety, Integrity, Excellence,"
good,"Once I was comfortable with driving a forklift and moving freight around with it, the job become much less stressful. There were very busy fast moving times during my shift and this meant working with multiple other employees including supervisors. Fairly repetitive but with new content daily."
good,Great company to work for. My position was eliminated when XPO Logistics purchased the company. Conway cared about there people. My immediate supervisor wanted to see me succeed.
good,This is a typical freight delivery company.  There were a few people that I really liked. Home everyday. Decent pay and good people. Seniority is overall on advancement.
good,"Process billing, Process requisitions, worked on AS400, key hazmat material, check on drivers returning with billing to process, work with management on reports for corporate office."
good,"A fast paced, positive results, performance based company. Multiple advancement opportunities provided. employee oriented benefits and open with recognition for a job well done."
good,cfi is what con way bought i was with them for 7 months they fired me saying i used to much fuel i dont under stand the meaning of that one for it being aq trucking company
good,"It was a great place to work. You will work long hard hours, but as a team you always get the job done. Great management and great team members."
good,"want of the  good companies , nice trucks ,nice drivers ,great co workers , some dispatchers are  dumbs,but overall great company"
good,Con-way has been a great place to partner with.  They have a long history of showing valued in their employees.  They have a great product to offer the market and rewarded success.
good,"As with any job, not every job is great but at least at Con-way Truckload the co-workers make coming to work so much better. Your co workers treat you better than family and they make you want to work better as a team and step in and help out when they needed. The employees take pride in their work and it shows."
good,I worked out of the franklin wi terminal as a driver( DSR)  CONWAY is a good company I worked there for 6mos human resources  was very thorough on the job description  told I would be working the dock that's fine I figured since I've been a driver for so long that working the dock for short amount of time ( I thought) on daily day would be fine  but I was not told I would be on the dock any where from 2to 6 hrs a day since I've been a driver for so long I rather be  a driver and not a dock worker your day consist you come in  and if needed you work the dock 2 to 3hrs then you peddle freight they usual want you in by 5 then you work the dock until done usual 3to 5hrs some days are shorter for working the dock I would have to say about 65% or a little less I've worked the dock I did try thought I would not miss driving but I do Conway was good to me the people from drivers dock workers and management are very fair and did listen to what you have to say they do hear your voice ( Like others have used aggressive words  on there reviews)  about CONWAY are not true Conway does not treat you poorly they do treat you as a equal  but I wish they would of been more  specific on how much dock work you do that's why some people wrote aggressive comment's about Conway that as a driver we did not expect so much dock work I say if you do not mind a lot of dock work CONWAY is a good company  but for me  I just was not a good fit  for the company or for me   I feel I need to be a driver feels more of a fit for me benefits are good as well
good,Everyone was so friendly and helpful no negativity at all. work at your own pace.
good,"laid back work environment, work is pretty consistent and very easy to catch on to"
good,A typical day at Conway start after you are called in.. Everyday you have wait to be on call in. They call drivers in according to how much freight is ready to be delivered. Conway calls drivers in off a seniority list. the higher you are on the seniority list the earlier you will be able to come into work.  I have learns lots of driving maneuvers how to parallel park a semi and how to maneuver a tracker and trailer in tight space and in closed quarters. New Station manager is cleaning up the station trying to make it a better work environment for everybody. I enjoy all my co-workers it like my second family.The hardest part of this job is when you are at the bottom of the seniority list and getting called in late and then just to get hours you have to stay all night. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when im driving.
good,"Conway pays well.  They hold you to a high standard, which is good to a point, but then it becomes too controlling.  They tolerate discrimination, and take care of senior employees, to the point of hypocrisy."
good,Every morning I come in and get a list for the items mark down or on sale for the week. I pull new items onto the floor from the stock room. I open packages for customers to see what they are buying and fold items and put them back into packages neatly. I refold towels and straighten sale bins. I learned to do interior decorating. If I had stayed I would have made manager. My co-workers were mostly young people and many confided in my about day to day problems and asked for prayer. The hardest part of the job is catching a thief that really needed the items. The most enjoyable part was spending the money I made on items for my own house.
good,I am looking to relocate to Cincinnati area to be closer to my family.
good,Spend 8 to 10 hours a day on the dock supervising the loading and unloading of freight.  Responsible for multiple employees.
good,Long work days. No balance of off time. Was on call and never knew for sure when I was working. Management was fairly easy to work with.
good,"delivery driver, load and unload trucks, drove a 36ft straight truck"
good,"I used to really enjoy currently working at con-way, a typical day for me is to go in at about nine pm, work the dock for about three or four hours, then hook up my trailers and drive to a regional destination such as Des Moines IA, St. Louis MO, or Wichita KS.  Management is good on the shift I work with, but the same cannot be said in my opinion of the shift I worked last year.  I have learned that in a blue collar setting it is very easy to make yourself noticed with could work ethic.  The hardest part of this job is the work to home life balance.  Many times I work thirteen hour days and am quite often to tired to enjoy my weekend.   The most enjoyable part of this job is the relationships I have built with my co-workers"
good,Conway is really not a bad company to work for if you could tolerate the night and weekend dispatchers. You could actually make money with conway.
good,"Typical involved assisting employees with benefits, payroll questions."
good,CFI was the best if not one of the very top companies to work for and in many ways it still is however there are some kinks from the sale to Con-way. Since Menlo owns stock in International they are required to purchase Prostar's and now they are going to 10 speeds with Tag Axle's.
good,load and unload trailer
good,they were very helpful learned alot things with them they were good to me made decent money with them
good,Long hours. The best of working here is the people. The hardest part was fatigue. You have to work very hard to advance.
good,Always enjoyed the job as did most of the people around you. You always had a sense of accomplishment and job satisfaction. You could be friends with people of all job titles
good,"Was a great place to work, with great equipment. The dedicated run i had was awesome Tucson-LAX 5 nights a week. Good management team. Top pay at the time."
good,its a really good company to work for grate hours and benefits and the pay are competitive with other company's and they always have good hours and over time
good,"Everyone worked and played as a team. No one was left out, everyone pulls their weight, and helps when needed. Opportunities for growth are always abundant, if you are willing to work for them."
good,"If you like extra board this is for you, but if you don't like knowing when your going to be called in, it is horrible. Good atmosphere to work in otherwise. You would be driving and working the dock, cold winters and got summers."
good,"I did many different roles including customer service, dispatching drivers and figuring out where lost freight belonged. I learned more keyboarding skills as well as billing for the company. My coworkers were amazing and always willing to go the extra mile for the team and the customer."
good,"Good job, steady work. A chance ay be available to go to truck driving school in the future. Work hours for dock workers average around 45 to 50 hours a week."
good,"Managed and maintained 180 current customers by face to face contact, email and phone calls. Handled customer issues and had to use problem solving ability to come up with solutions for both internal and external customers. "
good,Conway is a great place to work for you'll learn a lot and could advanced in position but sadly management wise is poor inbound manager doesn't know how to treat employees
good,I worked here for 2 years a Dock worker. I worked a ton of overtime which was great since I was in college. Also the supervisors are down to earth.
good,"Handling money and credit card purchases making sure customer received a good shopping experience, and handling the exchange and return transactions. Communicated store policy on refunds exchanges, pantie, and clearance merchandise. Answer phones with proper greetings. Keeping front lane neat and clean, and go backs organized. Processed front lane merchandise."
good,"overboard on accountability.  to quick to punish, and never praise.  alienates crew.  no real training, but superficial.  good leadership should listen to personnel."
good,"Looking back i should have kept my job at Con-Way Freight, the benefits are their. Other employees were helpful while i learned the job, they were ready and willing to lend a helping hand whenever i needed it. The hardest part of the job was finding a solid forklift other than that it was straight to the point."
good,"Con-Way does an excellent job at their core business of Moving LTL shipments.  This is the best place to learn about the LTL industry."
good,Conway freight was one of the best jobs i had ever had. Although i was a temporary employee i was treated like i was a full time employee even though i worked full time hours. The atmosphere was friendly even though there were so many different personalities to deal with. Management was always open to talk about any concerns about employees
good,"My typical day when i get in is set appointments for customers we are delivering freight to. Then I get the bills from what the drivers deliver and i scan them in to a computer. If there is a problem with the bill, I will, I will bill it manually. I love my co-workers they are great, feels like a second family."
good,its like working in any normal retail environment. work hard to serve people
good,I really believe that anyone wanting to get into transportation that Conway is the way to go.  The peers are great and team work is great.
good,"Good Company, very innovative and rewarding job. No complaints. Long hours yet rewarding."
good,Typical day is highly active..very hectic..requiring a lot of multi tasking. Love working with people and the constant daily interaction with them.
good,"Great pay and benefits!"
good,"Great benefits, good environment and great culture. Over 20,000 employees in the US and Canada.  The company is investing in new technology and moving forward as one of the best LTL companies in the United States."
good,You get out whatever you put in to this job (OTR truck driver).  The company is professional and strict.  I enjoyed being on my own and driving all over.
good,Bad thing about flex board was long nights at work plus I had an hour travel time to and from work. More work than life.
good,"At first I was unhappy because analytically-inclined, numbers-counters as managers documented every little thing, no matter how minor and I felt very negative about myself and my performance. But then I had a discussion with management and was surprised to find out that my performance was considered to be good. I was not receiving any positive feedback. However, the corporation is making a concerted effort to change the company culture to be one that values safety over speed and one that solicits innovation from the bottom-up as opposed to top-down oppressive demands to hurry and produce more numbers. I see that many managers are really trying to get on board with the changes and now I am starting to feel better about the company. I believe productivity improves with a positive environment, not with constant hounding and pushing."
good,"I've been here 6 weeks and I came over here with 15 months experience at Vitran Express. I was already doing night line-haul so I figured that I might as well be compensated better for my efforts, along with the sacrifices of missing school functions with my teenagers, etc, etc...If you’re a driver you already know the drill."
good,This was not any fun just try to get by. But the management is very good. very professional and discipline.
good,"Good co. To work for! I'm just ready to start a family, and I can't do that over the road!"
good,"Con-way is an LTL Freight company embarking on a culture journey that has been resistant to change for years. Safety, Accountability, Leadership, and integrity are all points of focus during this transition, however, the typical hourly employee seem some what resistant to change, making for the real challenge. While continuing a tradition of leading LTL freight companies on damage free and transit time, management must change the habits and"
good,"The daily work day is generally structured and follow the same routine. You will be able to sharpen your skill for problem solving while building business relationships that can last a life time. The hardest part of the job is you are hired based on seniority which while the pay scale is very fair even on the high end, your hours generally will be starting at the 3rd shift which will take cooperation and sacrifice from your family. What I most enjoy about the job is meeting and networking with people from all over the world. Working here you are made to feel that your job is the most important job held which gives great positive work sigma."
good,Great pay...you will earn it. Good people to work with. Good benefits. Better than average benefits.
good,Was a fun place to work. You develop a good relationship with people making it a fun work environment. You are around people yet at the same time assigned your specific job where it seems like you don't have to worry about someone just standing over your shoulder and micro managing everything you do.
good,"Great company with stable, good and hard working individuals. I really felt like I was apart of a team there. Pay is average but the level of teamwork there is second to none."
good,Opening the doors and walking around to make sure nothing out of place. I learn nobody is going to happy when you actually have to chase somebody down because they was trying to steal. I like that my managers let us do our job and only talk to us when or if need to be. Everyone was treated like family and even though my job was to make sure no one was stealing. being let go was a shocker because I thought I did nothing wrong. I got to meet very good friends
good,"Conway Corp has always been a great place to work, with lots of opportunities in various fields.  The wide variety of services we supply provides a very wide variety of job opportunities in different fields.  Once you are hired by Conway Corp, there is a good chance you will be able to retire."
good,I enjoyed what I was doing as a job. But the distance to get there and having to work 2nd shift just didn't work well for the position I was in at the time.
good,Overall a good place to work with great potential of advancement. Great safety team and great training with the ability to become a cdl certified driver.
good,"Con-way was a great company and I loved working there, but it was bought out in 2016 by XPO Logistics.  Therefore, the company no longer exists and a review is not necessary."
good,It has a good safety culture and the people I worked with were friendly and very helpful. the hours weren't all that great I was working from 4 until 830 or 9 depending on how much freight had to be moved.
good,They closed this business a few years ago. But overall it was a great place to work with friendly staff. Pretty good pay for the type of work you did .
good,"Very great place to work,supervisors with great attitude.always some one there to help out when inneed.I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an opportunity."
good,I had no problems working for Con-Way Freight. It was a very fast paced environment and you were to busy to have any issues. If I didn't get injured I would still be there.
good,This was a nice company to learn city driving.  Good attitudes from staff and drivers.  Office worked well with the drivers.  The customers appreciated our service.
good,Con-way is a good place to work. They compensate well and have a great benefit package. Good advancement opportunities and positive upper management.
good,"Great company to work for, fast pace environment, great co-workers, anytime i needed help there was also someone around to help! i can't really say anything bad about Con-Way except if you're in the Northeast region as a new driver expect to not get any drive time or any real hours for at least a year or until new hires come around.."
good,Bad upper management change rules as they go.management has there favorites and treats them above other workers.company has been sold to xpo  and they are in the process of down sizing  so don't expect a long career at xpo. All upper management first and then everyone else will be out of a job.
good,"A moderate past morning detail do to safety purposes breaking trailers at a satellite dock with no heat and in Montana. A good safety oriented company focused on efficiency and customer service and satisfaction. I believe most of our drivers were team players. We operated by company protocol with permission to operate freely outside of protocol if permission was obtained from the main terminal Manager. Because we were at a isolated terminal we had no supervisors on location so it was advantageous for all to work together. The hardest part of the job was the long days servicing Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota where the temperature dropped to minus thirty below zero. Although Engine heaters were used often, Vehicles engines would not always start and slowed our progress. Although for the most part driving tractor trailers was enjoyable and sometime challenging especially in the winters. In any position I worked I always found people to learn from and developed new techniques and these guys did help me to look ahead and plan my delivery day before the morning started. Learning these kind of positive techniques are always challenging and fun."
good,"Great company to work for, but the benefits and organization of work could be better. Nice co-workers and management to work with."
good,Fantastic core values are lived each and every day. Team dynamic is expected by each employee. Accuracy and reliability are paramount to succeed.
good,Overall a good place to work but being taken over by XPO which is not known to have a good culture and is known for lower pay rates.
good,"Major carrier with top training program, excellent customer service backup, excellent benefits, and top of the line equipment. Strong marketing programs aimed to target all accounts at all levels with above average discounts."
good,"A typical day at work for me was, getting to work by 6:30am and sitting down at the next available desk and starting off with the paperwork from the previous night. Throughout my job experience at Conway I learned what documents would have to be included in order to leave Canada or get into Canada. I learned everything there was about Canada's border control and had to also deal with some of the workers at their offices. I also had to directly talk to brokers and file documents to companies and brokers. During the time duration of working at Conway I was the youngest one working there and was constantly surrounded by older people. This made me feel and also act a lot more mature then my day to day life. The hardest part of the job would have to be the beginning because the management didn't really explain many things to me very clearly, I had to take the initiative and teach myself many things which obviously was hard to do. Although there are many cons about this job, this is still a wonderful and welcoming place to work at."
good,"A typical day at Con-Way began with Reviewing customer invoices for accuracy and mailing them off. Then reviewing and responding to consistent alerts from brokerage requesting credit on new or existing customers, along with setting up new carriers for multimodal and menlo worldwide when the help was needed. Followed by collections on past due accounts  sending emails, making phone calls or mailing requests for payment, and documenting my efforts, or ability to collect and resolve. Posting the previous days credit card payments on an excel spreadsheet for cash applications review. Would also assist with the Cash app rep when needed to insure proper cash application of the customers remittance. Sending Trade reference inquiry request for customers needing credit. Processing credit cards for payment on future and existing shipments. Reconciling accounts, and processing request for vouchers. and varies duties as assigned. I learned about the transportation industry daily from customers and co-workers, I also learned more about how to handle and resolve past due accounts with difficult customers in the this industry. Management was available for assistance whenever needed, some bigger accounts required credit requests outside of our allocation. My co-workers alternated breaks and lunches, so we were always helping each other out with customers, requests, credit cards processing . We took on each others customer as our own when necessary. The hardest part of my day would be when reviewing credit reports for customers that did not qualify for credit, after they spent time with brokerage"
good,"work swing shift"
good,"Answered phones"
good,"I would usually start my day around 3:00 pm would start the day off by Hosteling  take away and backing trailers to the dock for loading or unloading. When that was done I would be Dispatched to a truck in which I would do Pick ups till about 6 pm. When I would get back i would grab a forklift and start unloading freight. This company moved anywhere from 300,000 to 500,00 lbs of freight a night with about 25 Driver/Loaders. This company also had a driver program that put me through their private school to obtain my class A. The hardest part of the job would b at the end of the night the guys lowest on the totem pole would b sent a hour away to drop off trailers and help load an unload at that facility and would get back home till 7 am."
good,"I have been working as a mechanic at Con-Way for about 5 and a half years now.  Con-Way is a great place to work, they offer awesome benefits and relatively good pay.  They have cultivated a culture of employee appreciation, and it shows.  They have great leadership that has let the company grow in an astronomical way in the last few years."

good,"Conway provided a fun and challenging environment daily. As a Billing Specialist, I held alot of responsibilities for company success and I loved it!"
good,Con-way was a great place to work. Driven for success and customer satisfaction.  Great profit sharing bonuses for the labor and management. Technology was also top of the line.
good,working at con-way frieght was a good experience i coming knowing nothing about transoportaion buiness i learned how to proporly load 28 foot trailer from nose to tell
good,The pay at Con-way was good. the hours was some times long. the trucks was good. the supervisors was nice and easy to work with. the training was very good.
good,Supervised all drivers and dock workers on all shifts. filled in for all supervisors on vacations/ time off. Which could mean working 4 different shifts a week.
good,Good company to wok for. The days away from home was too long. Had good benefits and made great money. They kept the team driver almost non stop. Would recommend to single person.
good,Conway was a nice place to work. It depended on Seniority every years that you got to bid on hours that you wanted to work and which route you wanted as well. Pay and Benefits were good. Over all nice place to work.
good,"Be patient, goo things will eventually come from there. Working there is close to a do it yourself type of venue. You may have issues with OT pay. Nice human resources man."
good,"Formerly Con-way now XPO was a competitively paying freight organization. After working their dock, in maintenance and finally administration I feel that the company is in the higher tier of employers."
good,I liked it. It was a good place to work. Sometimes long hours but good opportunity to learn ins and outs of the industry. If you like the long hours you have an opportunity to go places.
good,This was a data entry job.  The incoming loads were divided onto other trucks for deliveries elsewhere.  I entered and prepared new bills for these deliveries.
good,the management treated good the employees. the employees are helping each one and another the manager is approachable an understand each one who meet problem.
good,Very organized.. Well kept clean and work at a well environment. I enjoyed then wave pallets wear moved around so smooth. Staff friendly and works like a team.
good,I loved it cause i only loaded and unloaded the trucks then clean up like sweep the whole warehouse and take the trash out and ckean the offices and parking lot
good,the job is Monday thru Friday working the dock and going out to swap trailers; or come in before 1200 to run route and then work on dock. pay is good. takes three years to top out. takes a long time to work your way up seniority board.
good,Enjoyed working at Conway with team members and manager. The work environment is amazing with good processes.The software department has many applications that is being supported by various IT employees.
good,"they are good in using new technologies. learned new culture of work and multi tasking jobs. good co workers, and they listen to our suggestions and ideas."
good,Great place to work top management knows how to train and develop employees. Compensation is fair and competitive. Great team atmosphere.
good,This company is a great company to work for but when it comes to having each other back they dont. Other mangers let there empolyees talk to them any type of way.
good,"This job was an eye opener. Helped me gain fork-lift operator skills and taught me at a young age the seriousness of being on a workforce team, and how to bring value to my team. The management there was extremely structured, being that most of them came from the military. my coworkers where great! Nice people who helped me when I needed it along the way. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep up with the professionals at fist, but as time went on I got the hang of it. The most enjoyable part was the challenged CONWAY posed."
good,I enjoyed working with many different types of people in 12 different states and Canada.  Everyday was different and the people made work fun.
good,"Con-Way Freight is a quality LTL (Less Than Truckload) company.  The system and data capture is very cutting edge for the industry and the equipment age is new to newer also.  The customers are unique in that every day sales activities you are working with a wide variety of manufactures and skill levels."
good,delivered and picked up from customers. enjoyed working for Conway. some long days but expected.coworkers were great. very nice company
good,this is a great place to work there its no big I's and little u's in this company everyone is treated fairly and equal there's open opportunity to grow in whatever aspect of this job that you would like janitor to shipping to truck driver to manager supervisor
good,"A typical day at work involved arriving late afternoon to begin answering customer phone inquiries for an hour or two while trying to achieve incoming driver bill processing into freight bills for the outbound deliveries, bill quota, assist callers with ETA regarding nightly deliveries, then finishing the last three hours getting all the bills finished and counted before leaving. Management for what it is does ok being all male and surviving within the confines of the small office (in comparison to other Con-way local branch offices) against all female billers/CS reps. That noted, like all of us - it has room for improvement and mainly with scheduling as the beginning of the year months work there was so slow there wasn't enough work to even keep me scheduled but possibly there isn't a fix for that (I don't know). The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is a pretty cohesive group though at Con-way which aside from occasional heavy/stressful bill load makes it a pleasant company to work for. The hardest part of the job and one thing that should be cautioned though is the Heavy Data Entry part of the job description. Unfortunately during my time with the company it meant HEAVY to the point of 80% of the billers all requiring being professionally medically treated for wrist/arm pain due to the physical strain of that requirement. I don't know what the current situation is, but hopefully that rate has been since attended to accordingly and with proper care so they girls are doing better. If not hopefully the right people read this and take action to do so. : )   Not sure"
good,Co-workers were great people to work with and that was probably the best thing about working there. It was a great job and had no problems as long as u stayed focused and did your job and kept up with the work load.
good,"Con-way is a good place to work, it is an extremely fast paced environment that is consistently changing. My subordinates are great people who bend over backwards to do a good job. Con-way's environment and culture is ever changing for best with our journey down the lean path. The job itself can be extremely challenging at times, but has its payoff in the end. The thing that I like the most about my job is the people and the fast paced environment."
good,I enjoyed working with my team. Learned a lot throughout my year of working.
good,Care about their drivers. Great equipment. This is a good company to work for.
good,"•	Effectively manage the inbound/outbound processing of various freight."
good,"Great job,learned new stuff everyday.management know everything about the job"
good,"A typical day at work for me is condensing in all departments to put more products out on the floor, cashier duties, team partnership in floor put backs and preparing for the next shift. This job really has no hard parts. The most enjoyable is interacting with customers and having a great professional relationships with other associates, and managers."
good,Has been a successful transportation company for 30+ yrs with a strong culture.
good,I never had a problem at this place it was just a temp position.
good,"Service all scheduled customers by the end of shift"

The only downside is that you pretty much have to live in Joplin, MO the rest of your life. Each department has a personality so if you don't like a certain one, try to get transferred."
good,"I would start out in customer service, handling any inbound calls or outbound calls. Handling customer situations (tracking, quotes, lost or damage freight, scheduling appts) then move to administrative assistant, working with 40 managers in the chicagoland/detroit regions, training any new hires, scheduling meetings/conference calls, creating reports, etc. Then moved to the operations side, made sure inbound was done on time or what could have been improved. dispatching and helping outbound with legal matters, getting out on time, etc. I got along great with co-workers, management. This is a very high fast past industry so I challenged myself to learn something new everyday. Most enjoyable was is a situation came to arise and I did not have the answer right then, I worked very timely to get the answer and made sure the customer was happy, also training people all over the country. Hardest part would not have the answer right away and sometimes it may take a few days to get the answer the customer wanted."

good,"At Conway, Your typical day would start at work by having to unload trailers that came in from the night line haul runs and then load your trailer for the days deliveries. Sometime the line haul guy came in late and that would add to your day by making you late for your deliveries and pickups.

Conway put a lot of trust in their drivers and trust that you will deliver your load on time.  Conway drivers are like a family of sisters and brothers, mothers and fathers.  They are always willing to help each other and if they don't know the answer to a question, trust and believe they will help you find the answer.

I would check the trailer for all the correct orders and check to make sure it was loaded properly and safely. I would do a tractor vehicle inspection for safety. then I would hook my trailer up and drive to all my assigned city deliveries. I used a 53 footer or I had a set of two 28 footers. I learned it is always good to double check your work, there is no reason for errors. Also follow safety guidelines is the number one rule. Management was always very helpful to employees. I was very well like by my co-workers, they appreciate hard workers and sometimes it took an extra hand to help with a difficult item of freight.

good,Work Hard and work Safely.  Well compensated for  your efforts.  very much a safety first company.  one of the highest paid positions compared to other  less then truckload companies.  The voice of the driver was very important to those in management.  starting with the immediate supervisor up to the ceo.

good,"You only work 30 hours a week for dock hands, if you work the dock and drive truck you will work 40+ hrs give or take. There is not a lot to say you drive a forklift, load & unload trucks and or you do both."
good,"Driving all hours required"
good,"good people, good place to work. they care about you and your family. compensation is fair. Cant say enough good about this place."

good,"Great company to work for. The pay is great for starting customer service, most than ive seen in a while."
good,"I start my day researching incoming freight and developing my projections for the evening. After that, drivers start coming in from various cities, and we begin to break their freight down and re-work everything to its loading point. We have to meet trailer utilization goals, score card metrics, dispatch deadlines, and a high percentage of undamaged freight. I learned how to manage large groups of people and delegate tasks to achieve an overall goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with the people there. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect; walking a concrete dock all night in the summer heat, subjected to the weather, and working the late third shift hours. "
good,"Constantly busy, day goes by fast. If you are a hard worker, you will like the job."
good,"Cleaning rooms, hallways, lobbies, restrooms, corridors, stairways and other work areas and removing trash from facilities daily."

good,Con-Way Truckload was a great company to work for.  They offered great pay and good benefits.  They always worked hard to get you time at home with family and compensated you for going the extra mile.
good,"Con-way was a very energetic, repetitious, and clean work environment. Management was very hands on with everyone which made things operate much smoother. If you didn't know how to do something regarding freight or certain job functions, they were right there to help. The pay is decent. The hours can be long at times but if you like a very fast pace and have a good sense of urgency then this job is for your."
good,Es una empresa con muchos valores y estrictos en diciplina
good,It was a great enviorment with great benefits! Hours were good and it came with plenty of occupied duties. I delt with multiple people from speaking Spanish to English. I learned a lot about the imprt export company and grew very fond of it.
good,"While there were a few hiccups when working there, overall it was a fantastic experience.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and was treated failry for the most part and given proper compensation for the hard work I did.  Definitely worth it."
good,"I pulled most anything that would go in a dry van.  I started off OTR, but changed to Regional to spend more time with my family.  I saw and learned a lot from going to some of the out of the way places they had customers.  I never had a problem with the management that a simple conversation couldn't solve.  They were very driver focused.  I saw parts of Canada I wold never have seen.  They would try to pre-plan your next trip usually. They offered a cash advance for a trip when they dispatched you from a terminal, only company I have seem that does that to make sure their drivers aren't out on the road broke."
good,"As good as a company to drive for gets. I had Zero issues with management and loved the job."
good,A typical day at work get truck loaded and ready to go.What I learned be responsible at all times.Management good job doing a tough job.hardest part of job trying  not bring any deliveries back to the terminal.most enjoyable helping other drivers get their work done.
good,I can honestly say this company treats its company drivers and Owner Operator with respect they deserve. Mostly all their facilities are driver friendly and dispatchers are very helpful and friendly. I would definitely go back
good,"Accountable for Daily operations of the store, including but not limited too: Open, close, hire, trained, deposits, scheduling, reports, merchandising, cashier, etc."
good,Great place to earn decent pay on a dock. Based on performance and experience they are willing to advance you on to higher positions. VERY cold winters but if you can get through that then the job is pretty good. Fun and enjoyable place to work.
good,"long hours, hard to find a work/life balance. pay and benefits are very good but wasn't worth the sacrifices after 6 years."
good,"Excellent company to work with in transportation. Involving working with loading and unloading trucks according to safety regulations."
good,"Long hours, good pay. Work hard and you will enjoy the benefits of it. Con-way is not for the weak hearted or weak minded, it is best if you go in and expect to work hard."
good,A every day job a con-way was different but exciting. I learned alot while i was with this company like how to properly load and unload trailers. My co-workers really made the job fell like family. The hardest part about the job was getting hired on full time even thought i was suppose to. Other than that it is a great company to work for
good,"It was stressful at times, but the team there was always so helpful, and I loved to be able to help them as well. Management made it fun on nights and were always helpful as well."
good,"At Conway, I would normally come in and assist with loading my truck in the morning. This is a LTL company so it really helped when the stops were lined up perfectly. I would make between 15 to 23 stops a day while building relationships with customers I would encounter on a day to day basis. I enjoyed working with the guys around me. A lot of us had pretty good bond that have been built over the years. Sometimes you hate to see those bonds go, but its respectably the nature of the business. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers everyday. The relationship that has been built with them at times seemed more like true friendship versus business."
good,"fun, fast paced enviorment ! great company to work for competitive pay and pleanty of opertunity to advance."

I learned that you have to be strong physically and mentally i also learned to work hard as team and to also work alnone when i needed to i learned something new everyday and thats what made it so exciting to go to work everyday. My co-workers were fun to be around some had the best sense of humor and i never mind working with an helping any ot them out i enjoyed everyone of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was really nothing i think the hardest part was when i encountered some guys that said some things to me that made me uncomfortable it made it hard but also made me stronger i never had anything that was too hard for me the most enjoyable part of the job was learning and meeting new people everyday i loved doing different things everyday i just really found a job that i really enjoyed going to work i have not found a job like that since the hours were perfect even the job was i also enjoyed the company eating that they had from time to time who dont enjoy eating but the co-workers were the enjoyable part of the job as well as me staying busy i love to stay busy.
good,"Conway Express was a great place to work. A daily routine consisted of answering phones and taking pickup orders from customers, taking customer service questions and helping customers find their freight. Once the onsite manager trained us a particular subject that he or the company wanted, he would basically leave us alone and let us run the office."
good,It's good fun and lots off attractions. Very well warm place joyful people lots of laughter Conway is a great place. County setting it's exciting to be here in Conway
good,Being an over the road truck driver my interaction with the staff of CFI was limited.  However when their was interaction was given the impression that what I had to say was actually  considered.
good,"Top notch company, second to none. Best work environment, in and out of the office. Some would say cult like , considering our loyalties. Great team involvement, One Team One Mission attitudes"
good,"I drove over-the-road for Conway Truckload for 3 yrs and I loved every minute of it. I traveled to almost every state, seen many amazing things. I even got to take my friend with me and my son for a month during the summer. It is a experience that I will forever remember."
good,It is a very competitive job.  Lots of reports and paperwork.  Can be rate competitive with other companies if it makes sense.  Lots of support from the whole sales organization and operations.  It was great to represent an upstanding company.
good,This company  is Cfi  before it was sold and changed to Cfi  so there is not to much more I can say about this place  other than it is a great place to work
good,Very nice place to work at.loved the people and customers. The drivers were awesome and very nice. If I ever moved back to NH I would try to get back in again.
good,"if you get hired get ready to work hard"
good,"Great place to work!! If you can get in stay. Amazing company who pays you to learn hot to drive for them. Great equipment as well. Bosses we great as well, laid back."
good,"The entire office was smaller than 30 people not including the drivers, we were all very well aware and considerate of one another  The office was a laid back fun place to work.  The shifts were pretty flexible too."
good,Conway  was bought out by XPO. this is a faced pace place to work and management isn't very committed or helpful to the employees. it is a cut throat place
good,Enjoying yours daily getting jobs done in a safe manner keeping focus on yours goals every day manger working driver on route deliving packages intact always check boxes crush shipment.
good,enjoyed the work; management very professional. great employee events for the whole family. always focused on safety and productivety. i founded it a great place to work
good,"I was terminated by Con-Way (now called XPO) but I am still gonna give them a good review.  It was a good job plain and simple.  they never treated me bad...of course they asked for more than I was willing to offer but every company will do that.  Some of the Freight Operations Supervisors can be persnickity and think that their poo doesn't stink but truckers have a way of working that out of a person.  Supervisors have to be trained like everyone else.  Be prepared, they honestly believe that your wife with the college degree in Home Economics is more suited to management than you are even though you have 10 years of experience.  I wish i still worked there though.  Safety is a big thing and you better hope someone sees what happened if you have an accident that wasn't your fault otherwise you will be blamed.  Which is what happened to me.  I was involved in an accident in which I was being safe and following all protocols but it wasn't on video and there were no witnesses...so I was blamed and considered at fault and asked to sign a document stating such...but because there was an injury involved I couldn't sign away their responsibility...They called that insubordination and I was terminated.  One thing...gotta watch the office and dock politics...they will snap back at you if you get it wrong."
good,"a work at your own pace learned many diff things such as transports "
good,"very friendly company competitive miles very detailed company safety first,keep you working call you by your first name and very safe equipment,they do their best to comply with your request"
good,"I enjoyed working for Con-way as the Executive Assistant to the Vice President of Gov't Relations in washington, DC, until the company was sold/disband in 2016.  Had it not been for that, I would still be working for Con-way.  Great company, management teeam, employees, goal oriented team.  Greatly missed by ALL!"
good,A good day would be impossible cause theres no such thing as a good day unless one makes it a good day. lets just say if one leaves the dock with a full trailer and you get to your stops and there not there one has to find a way to move that freight to one side. But I knew a lot of people that I could trust and they would let me use there dock to unload the freight that way in my way and leave it there so I can finish my route and then go back and pick it up and they would give me there freight to.
good,I love working for Conway my first Class A job out of school i left because i brought my own truck and move on to owner operator no other comment none
good,id get my truck hook up both trailers got my bills did a pretrip and drove to my terminal dropped trailers and worked the dock for 4 hours then hooked up to different trailers and drove back to home base
good,Working for Con-way Freight was a great experience. The only reason why I left was because I had to relocate to another country with my family. This company gave me the opportunity to grow personally and advance in my career. I was surrounded with great people. very intelligent coworkers and very diverse. It was full of challenges but the company's culture was  to help each other. I Tha hardest part of the job was balancing the very demanding job I had at that time with my family. I had to juggle a lot.
good,"Loved my job here, great people, relaxed environment and never felt under pressure wish I could work there again! ..........................................."

good,"Liked working for this company, they were all about the drivers. What they thought and helped them when they needed it. Never had a problem with them, back in 2007 when my brother in law was dying they sent us home so we could be there for my sister. When my brother in law did pass that June we called them and they told us not to worry about anything, that is why I liked working for them."
good,The managers was very good trained to do whats is giid for the company and always try to help people to learn.  The human Resources people was always there when you needed
good,"I came back after 11 years, to my surprise a lot of the folks who I had worked with as CFI was still there. The way they operated seemed to be the same as it was with CFI. Con-way now known as XPO logistics they were not the reason why I left. My health was not up to D.O.T. requirements. If I was to go back to driving I would go back to XPO logistics. I did enjoy working there, I made good money. "
good,"Con-way Freight was one of my favorite places to work, I was very sad when I decided to leave after moving away.  All of the staff is fun and we all worked as a great team."

good,This is hands down the best company to work for. This company cares about their employers. I would still be working there today had I not moved back to Virginia
good,"The work was challenging, but that made it fun. Everybody worked together in order to get the job done. We all treated each other with respect and I consider many of the people I worked with to be my friends. The hardest part of the job was fighting the weather conditions. Rain and snow often made it difficult to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being out doors and having a birds eye view of things. I learned that working together as a team is a must and working safe and going home every day safe and sound to our families."
good,"Its a good company to raise a family on and if you stick with it or can handle the line haul you will make good money here.  I was more of a delivery driver than a p/d dock worker,  so it just wasn't for me.  Got along with all the drivers and they train you well"

good,Conway was a great company to work for. Every day was met with new challenges. I created invoices for shipments hauled. We had to have a minimum of 98% accuracy to hold the job. I had all kinds of different accounts that required different requirements on each invoice. I had accounts that required billing on websites or via Spreadsheet. Management always challenged us to do our best.
good,"Busy, I enjoy working with the drivers.I enjoy working with the other greeters. My company was just changed to XPO and the changes are so far good.I need full time and this is one thing that is not going to change."
good,This was a friendly atmosphere and a great place to work.  It as full of fun and a great place to learn the various aspects of the business.

good,Prevented theft. Monitored footage. It is a good place to work. I learned to be detailed oriented. There was no hard parts to this position because there is always room for growth.

good,I load and unload according to our safe stack system.Not damaging any freight was the company's pride behind safety of course.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of arriving an hour prior to the actual start time and lounging at the cafeteria.  Once I began my work day, I inspected my fork lift, assuring the lights were functioning properly, make sure the propane gas was full and checked the battery to ensure it had sufficient water.  Following this, I would scan the freight onto the truck and make sure everything was organized and weighed out properly.  Next, I would review my paperwork before sending out all the trucks.  Then, I would dispatch the trucks and make sure they arrived at the right location.  "
good,Best company I've worked for by far so far great people fast paced great pay also great safety record and equipment. Also they will do anything to help you out!!!

good,The company worked together to satisfy the customer and profit at the same time. I really enjoyed my time there.

good,drive 600 miles per day. learn to read road maps. excellent management. co-worker are like family always keep in touch with each other. staying away from home. travel the us and canada
good,"I absolutely loved working for Con-Way. Our dispatcher was an awesome guy, a dry sense of humor, but he got us where we needed to go. Of course, any trucking job is going to have a horrible job work/life balance but I believe Con-Way was different when it came to home time. Typically, the rule of thumb is you get a day off for every week you're out. However, if we we're out for only two weeks and requested three or four days off, it was given to us without a hard time. They make sure you're taken care of. Also, the pay is one of the best. Teams (which I drove) make 45cpm and solos make 37cpm, both with only 1 year experience. They have a great recruiting program, safety bonuses, Hazmat and Northeast pay, ETC. Our truck only had one problem (if you're a team, you get a truck with no more than 20,000 miles) and it got fixed right away without having to wait hours for dispatch to get back to the shop about what is going on."
good,This company seems to honestly care about their employees and customers.
good,"Responsibilities included loading and unloading freight in a fast paced environment while using safe stack and other ways to secure the freight. I worked the Outbound, and the Night FAC shifts. My major responsibilities on the dock for Outbound, and FAC were loading.  Safety was always the number one key we focused on everyday."
good,"If you love the work you do,you will always have fun in what you are doing.There is no hard work, long as you know what you are doing.  my co-workers are vary good peolpe to work with."
good,"A fun place to work with the senior drivers as well as the rookies ,if lost ,help is a phone call away .Office personnel very helpful if you had a return and there isn't info on the d .r. Management concerned about your safety and the safety of others .The hardest part of the job is driving through the morning traffic to get to your first stop .The most enjoyable part of the job is when you completed all your stops and pickups of the day and did it safely."
good,I have been treated professionally at all times.  Conway does not forget who I am while I'm over the road. They are a great company to work for.
good,I work there for an agency. I try to get a permenent position but work started to be low so they could give me  a full position..

good,I liked working there.
good,"From the facilities to the supervisors to the co-workers, everything at Con-Way was top-notch. The trucking industry can be a bad job at other companies due to the nature of the job. This was not the case at Con-Way because Con-Way takes care of its workers."
good,"Coming to work for this company was invigorating. I enjoyed everything about this company. The people I worked for had a lot of respect for the driver. I never had a dull moment with this company. I've learned with this company is, If you put your mind to it, any thing is possible. As far as management is concerned, they give an equal chance to you. Co-workers: friends forever. And I never had any serious complaints about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was having top notch equipment to drive."
good,working start 1am to 2pm i learn more skill as being dock worker and good management.and friendly co workers hard job but its worthted and you injoy working in conway
good,pay was acceptable to pay bills
