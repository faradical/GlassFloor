bad,I thought working under Warren Buffett was going to be a good idea boy was I wrong. All they do Is play favorites and you have no power to change that don't kiss up to them just find a different job these dealerships are a disgrace to the human race they really make you look at people differently
bad,"They were deceptive from start. Offered me salary much less than what was advertised. Healthcare premiums very expensive, $1500/month."
bad,I was dedicated always on time and never missed a day....was fired for something I didn't do ..and that something was so minor...I believe they wanted to pay someone less for what I did.....so they found a reason to for me ...I loved my job and was dedicated ..so I feel they are all about the money nor the people ..they really screwed me.....and I am trying to be nice ...I have more to say but ..I won't ...thank you...
bad,"Management was very unfair, favoritism, pay raises very low,  if you weren't popular were not considered in the group. Did enjoy talking to the customers, and learned alot."
bad,"Toxic work environment, never had any COL raises.  Staff was treated with disdain by management."
bad,"I got fired when I came to work on nov 4, . 2016 after watching my boyfriend be taken off a respirator the the day before nov 3, 2016.  They even refused to pay the unemployment but the unemployment judge ruled in my favor"
bad,The employees are difficult to work with and the management has no management skills.  The benefits are really pretty lame as well.  They are cheap when it comes to what they pay their employees. It's a harsh environment to work in and I don't recommend even my enemies work there.
bad,"Cant call in sick, no advancement, pay sucked, no care for employees. No employe moral, no pay raise or bonuses. No care for employees. Points against you if you call out sick"
bad,The company does not value the employees.  They are mostly concerned with the corporate leaders vs the plant employees.  There is no respect from the leadership.
bad,id rather not do this question. its all my opinions and some peopel may think its great just not for me too much stress and no time to selves due to mandatory ot
bad,"Not very thrilled with this place. Stressful job with the calls, pay was not great and you had to work a Saturday a month. OK if you just need a basic job but other than that I would pass."
bad,"Very busy office. Management leaving company."
bad,I would rather not give any opinions on Berkshire Hathaway because I did not work for them directly but was employed by one of the many companies they own.
bad,"Company provides little chance for advancement and no incentive for going above and beyond your remit, preferring to keep employees on the poverty line basic pay-scale for anyone not involved in Field Operations."
good,"Good enviroment to work in except they micromanage too much and heavy work loads and not enough pay, good benefits and plenty of pto hours avalable."
good,"This is a very unstructured company that didn't exist 3 years ago.  BH Media has grow from 1 newspaper to almost 80 in that time.  The company is run by a small group of executives from Omaha who have no experience running a multiple property company and as a result many things are done ""on the fly"" or based on their single newspaper experiences in an isolated market..Omaha"
good,Work/Life Balance should be implemented. Won't say much else about this employer.  Most of the people are pleasant to work with
good,The management team that I worked under was not supportive of subordinates advancement potential. If you end up on a supportive management team then you can go places within the organization. Really have to be an advocate for yourself.
good,Berkshire Hathaway is a very professional real estate company that has ample training and guidance to assist you as a real estate agent. I enjoyed working in a team environment.
good,"It is a great place to make some good money. But the 60+ hours a week work will make you exhausted if you have prior engagements. Work takes up most of your time, but it is great for people who are single/ or have been the business and have adjusted to the schedule. The incentives are great if you hit your bonuses but it is only regularly achieved by a handful of people who the manager favors. Do not get me wrong, you can work hard and achieve that too, but doing that day in day out for 12 hours a day can get tiresome. The company has been good to me but it is just not what I was looking for. You can see it as a personal choice and not the company for anyone willing to put in the work and effort."
good,"Berkshire is a stable company, but there was not much mid-level career advancement at my location during the period I worked there.  Additionally, experience and skill was not a driver for promotion, instead they wanted to higher recent college graduates with little experience, but with a willingness to learn."
good,"I enjoyed working with the newer senior staff that came after I was hired , better team chemistry than the original staff more collaboration. I guess because they were not looking to prove their job worth Also, seems to be a huge gap in skill between infrastructure team and help desk staff."
good,"Great co-workers, The Broker is sleazy, and gives the top realtors the leads, most of the new folks do not get help from the broker, and they do not get leads.  The new folks are paired with a senior realtor, and they must split their sales with the senior representative, and this causes tension with the new people."
good,"Great management team who are willing to give you the support you need to succeed in real estate.  Also, has a host of outside vendors waiting to help you as well."
good,"Tight workplace I enjoyed working there. It was very fun and exciting, the location is near my home. I learned very much regarding residential real estate."
good,It's a call center.  Not a career path.  You will burn out.  If you need cash in the meantime then this is a decent place to be.  I was treated well while I worked here.
good,Working for a large broker has its pro and cons. There are a lot of fees charged to the agents and the splits aren't that good. I received a decent amount of support.
good,I like all the people I work with and for. Nothing against them. I just don't care for the company. I don't feel like they care enough for the employees that work for them.
good,Enjoyed my work experience there. Educational opportunities were useful and fulfilling. The staff and associates are very helpful and willing to share their knowledge.
good,I worked very hard learned a lot.  but management needed a faster turnaround at work.  enjoyed the atmosphere. would have liked to work longer.  Learned a lot
good,"Kennett Square office of BHHS Fox & Roach Realtors is a very positive, supportive, flexible work environment. The Company offers many tools to make you a more effective agent."
good,Learned a lot but wasn't a big fan of the people I was working with.
good,"●	Greeting the customer via telephone with a welcoming and friendly presentation."
good,"The company was a great multi-billion dollar company, however it seems as though they are far behind on their times when it comes to technological innovations. There was not that much structure in the sales department as far as a day-to-day cycle. I was quite unsure of what my responsibilities were up until the day I was laid off. However, they did try and look out for one another within the company and made it fell as familial as possible."
good,"There's a wonderful work place culture, but its a hard place to work. There is a lot of work to accomplish each day. the company is an industry leader. When I visited your web site, I found some impressive information about the future projects they have planned. I was also impressed with the founders' backgrounds and the current financial statements."
good,I loved the atmosphere and how everyday was something new to learn. My staff was always willing to work as a team which reflected well upon our residents which was a main reason we had such a low turn over.
good,"The work environment was professional but casual. The bosses were always helpful and understanding of the employees' issues. The company also realized that being on the phone all day every day can be stressful and sometimes there were games,work-related of course, but they would help to alleviate some of the stress."
good,"Berkshire is a good starting company. Unfortunately the wages are not competitive to other companies in the market. When you can start out at the competition making more than you left this company with after several years. There is something wrong with the company. No scholarship programs that are geared to all employees. Only minorities get a full ride scholarship. Which is great for them, but does not help anyone else when you are working for less than $11.00 an hour. Raises tend to be between 1 to 3 percent and you start out at $10.08 an hour. And raises are once a year.  The one good thing is your PTO time. They start you right away with PTO, but If you are sick they apply the PTO to your absence and you are also given a black mark for missing work. Raises were terrible, vey few advancement jobs. And a lot of promises of advancement that never happened. Customers could be very difficult."
good,"Working at Hathaway Manor, I have gained a successful experience of what it's like to have a ""first job""; however, the work environment is frustrating at times. Management is also confused from time to time but other than that, not an awful place to work."
good,"You were on your feet for about 12 hours a day just selling merchandise to stock owners. Customer service is a must."
good,"Brooks is Amerikaans hardloop merk, dochteronderneming van Berkshire Hathaway, gevestigd in Seattle. Europees hoofdkantoor is gevestigd in Amsterdam, Brooks Sports BV, welke twee jaar geleden is opgericht."
good,"Small business trying to become a larger one .  Will get there one day, but will have to beat what it's doing .  Do not seem to be able to pull off its business plan on any level.  Projected 175 employees by end of 2016, have about 40 . Good people, but this just isn't happening right now."
good,these managers just make me so mad they are very bad at what they do no one helps when asked you are hazed regularly very poor work environment to be in
good,"Due to this specific branch being new and the team being very small, some improvements and systems are still being created, partly by myself. The benefit of this is that I learned how to create, develop and implement new processes. I had to learn most of my tasks, responsibilities and projects independently and hands-on. This has put me a great step forward in my professional life in a very short amount of time."
good,This is the place for new graduates to work.  They pay $60k for trainees. They provided all the training tools. It will teach you a lot on how to deal with different ethnicity.
good,"You get what you put in. You are building your business, the more people you know the greater potential to make money. It's a unique field."
good,This company is great to work for. The people are willing to help you succeed and share their knowledge with you too. You really couldn't ask for a more positive work environment.
good,I started off as intern and worked up to marketing manger. Definitely an environment where everyone wants you to grow and do better. The pay wasn't the best for the desired amount of work and dedication a job like that takes.
good,This business requires someone to take advantage of the training and tools available .  Berkshire Hathaway provided many great tools and training opportunities.
good,"Company provides numerous benefits to both new and existing agents. Tons of on-going training provided to maximize your success. Commission split for new agents can be difficult to work with, but company-paid benefits tend to cancel out."
good,"Extensive experience in system analysis, design, development and implementation of web based and client/server application using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, Java/J2EE, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, XML, XSLT, Python, Django, PHP. "
good,Learned to grow into a leadership role and mentor other team members.

good,"Berkshire was an awesome company to work for I only left due to health reasons, would recommend them to others. Very professional and successful company."
good,"BH has a wealth of free resources available to make their agents successful!!  They provide marketing materials, training - both in-house and online, coaching calls and more!"
good,I would continue to work there but I feel I need to move on. Realtors very knowledgeable and friendly. Very ethical and care deeply for their customers.
good,This is an opportunity for people who know how to work independently and have the discipline to be entrepreneurs.  Some don't make anything and some get rich.  It depends on your connections and your ability to network effectively

good,Trained me from the ground-up straight out of undergrad; good group of associates that enhanced office culture immensely.
good,I enjoy working at Berkshire and love the people I work with. Management is a bit overbearing and they tend to micromanage at times but it is pretty good to work for.
good,"Working with berkshire hathaway was in a way great & in a other ways very difficult. I believe if I had applied myself a lot more at the company that I could have seen better results. However, the business is one in which you really need to dedicate your time daily."
good,Working for this company ensured career advancement. This place to work was run by managers to atrictly cares for employees. They always took time to ensure techs were happy.
good,"Originally worked as an real estate agent in partnership with my husband.  We sold upscale property in Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and surrounding areas.  We represented properties priced from $500,000 to $15,000,000."
good,Great place with lot of flexibility and good co-workers and management.  Training as needed and great marketing. Good supportive office and if you work hard you will reap the benefits.
good,"Great people to work with, they make to job more interesting and fun."
good,"The atmosphere was very professional, and communication was vital for this company to have success. The employees all worked well together even if they were in different departments."
good,"Berkshire Hathaway Fox Roach is a great place.  It is a typical real estate office, but they treat the realtors professionally and fairly.  Feels like a family."
good,You must be very strong willed and assertive to do this job. If you are not a strong enough person to just tell a customer no that is not possible then this is not the right place for you.
good,"This was my first office job. I enjoyed the work and the people I worked with. Only complaint was getting the time off if my kids were sick. If I didn't have to move for my husband's job, I would've stayed indefinitely."
good,"Professional and easy work environment.  The brokers are available around the clock for any questions, support and issues you may have.  The support is done willingly, dignified and with a smile.   Hard to find sometimes in other institutions."
good,"I absolutely love working here. The benefits are great and the people here are awesome. There's no drama and it feels like family. They give 16 days of PTO, immediate medical benefits, and even 401K after a year of employment that matches 100%. They are closing down the FL office and I may not be ready to relocate to stay with the company. If it weren't for this I'd stay with them. The downside would be not enough opportunity to advance. Once you're a supervisor you can be stuck there and the raises aren't too good. Other than that this company cares for their employees."
good,"Berkshire Hathaway as a whole, is an amazing company. As an agent, you want to make sure you pick the right broker. One that will assist and guide you during the beginning stages if being an agent."
good,"There is not anything negative I could say about Berkshire Hathaway, I would definitely recommend to clients and friends. I just feel I was a better fit at Keller Williams, both great companies."

good,You operate as an individual business owner You are responsible for educating yourself and involving yourself in training's to learn what is required to be successful in this profession. Connections and networking is your basis for success.
good,"Berkshire Hathaway is a great place to work because of the people. Top notch in recruiting the right people who work well together as a team.

The hardest part about this job is not having stability in income, and no benefits."
good,"Loved the Company, great split for pay no office fees and access to all of the marketing material. I was privileged to conduct open houses for realtors within the company to grow my business."
good,"A typical day at the office is different each day, some days it would be more office and paperwork while others consisted of running around going to meetings. Everyone you came across was friendly and you see new faces each day. The most difficult part of this job was depending completely on income from commission, especially being new to the industry. On the other hand it was nice to make your own schedule and meet new people on the regular."
good,"As an independent contractor my days are spent contacting clients and prospects by phone, in person, direct mail, email and online through social media. A great deal of time is spent chasing leads or figuring out where my best return on investment is when it comes to marketing myself. "
good,I learned a good skill being able to talk to clients seeing exactly with what they need sometimes see what they had in mind. It puts you in a perspective of the real estate value.

I loved the people that worked there; the stories about World War II and how our attached mill played a large role in the war efforts.

good,I enjoy working as a Realtor and helping others.  Typically a day would include business meetings and then helping clients with home searches and preparing contracts. The day is flexible and can change at anytime. My office is friendly and the manager is always eager to help.
