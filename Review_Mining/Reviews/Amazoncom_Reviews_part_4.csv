good,"My time here has been good so far its just some things I wish could change. For instance longer breaks. But the co-workers are good people, management is good. Hardest part about working is standing for 10-12 hour shifts."
good,"Work space is really good,have learned many new designing concepts and the way to lead a team, we have a friendly management and co-workers with good helping mentality. Our team is really hard working, will finish all the work before deadline at the same time enjoyable group."
good,"My Daily work is"
good,"Amazon is a very organised company that motivate associates to reach company's goals with fast, quality assurance as well as a fun workplace"
good,"Awesome place to work. Great opportunity for anyone, Career opportunity. During my time there, I developed life lasting skills and work ethic!"
good,"Generally, the experience of one's internship at Amazon is dependent on the team in which they are placed. Fortunately, my team was a great group of people. As long as you showed daily progress, the work environment should be fairly relaxed. However, tickets requiring large attention can cause quite the hectic scene. The was an agile workflow, and sometimes it would seem like the process was unnecessary, but it did keep the progress of work going and organized. Most enjoyable part of this were the connections and people that I interacted with."
good,learned a lot from what they had to offer. Taught me on many different types of forklifts and I was a very quick learner and enjoyed my days working there. the other employees and management loved to have me there everyday. They asked me for my opinions on the job and I always tried to increase production and moral for all other co-workers. when new seasonal or full-time employees came in I gave them all the knowledge I learned and taught them at a pace I felt was good for everyone to understand. My days at amazon were some of the best times working I've had and the friends/co-workers made me smile everyday
good,Working at Amazon has not been okay for me. I love the pay wage and love the hours. The one thing I didn't love while working at there Moonachie location is the pay issues I have had. I don't like Amazon's attitude when it comes to paying there employees. There were actually times where they have not paid me for the days I actually worked. There Fulfillment center was not kept clean therefore my face would break out and my skin would be itching constantly. It was not a blast working here.
good,The  job is interesting the people I work with come from all different backgrounds and cultures. It is very challenging and I feel a healthy place to work. Over time is available and helps to have in these days.
good,"Selling on Amazon is great! You work at your pace and publish as much or as little as you want. I have learned how to create eBooks as well as the do's and don't's of promotion. If you don't know a lot of people or have much money, promotion can be difficult. However, you can publish on Amazon from home, and the representatives are very helpful when needed. The greatest part about selling on Amazon is, you are your own boss."
good,"A nice place to work with a good friendly team, but looking now for a new experience closer to my skills and abilities. A typical day at work is usually busy, with lots of interesting tasks and real targets to achieve."
good,A typical day working at Amazon is simple and repetitive work for long hours through the day. What you learn working here is how a warehouse system operates. You also learn several different warehouse jobs as well. Everyone is well versatile working there. The management at Amazon is well organized and are willing to help you as best as they can. There are some co-workers there where you can make some friends but most of the time you are isolated and being by yourself. The hardest part of the job is just dealing with the very long hours they give you from 10 hours to 14 hours of work. The most enjoyable part of this job is the money you can make.
good,"Packing costumers orders, making rate and exceeding rate. Number one packer. Made friends with the other top packers on the floor.  Many Positive documentations. Was trained to Problem Solve for all the hard work which was recognized by Managers. Only 1 out of 5 trainees to fully understand and work independently as a Problem Solver."
good,"Have fun working at amazon. Peak season was the best, always fun talking and working with co workers. Hardest part of the job was standing up for long periods at a time."
good,The Amazon sort center in Pittsburgh overall a good place to work.  All the work at my level was very standardized and involved a lot of repetition but was enjoyable.  Management is always accessible but it can be hard to get to HR at times
good,"Amazon has been the most employee concerned company I've worked for thus far. Management thrives to maintain a fun, respectful, and productivity promoting culture."
good,"it was a well organized company with with alot of opportunity. a really fast pace job. working side by side with co-workers, helping each other. learned alot about the product we builded. it was a great experienced."
good,"Une journée type chez Amazon correspond a :"
good,"Many things are still being figured out at DFW7, so there isn't much consistency to its structure. Negative factors of the job are slowly being worked on due to persistent debate."
good,a typical day at work would be me coming in going to my locker putting my cell phone and other items into my locker then going to my department and as a group doing our morning stretches then going to my station and scanning items management is really nice and they stick with you until they feel you you are ready to be left alone  my co works are very nice but in my line of work its not time for talking but the hardest part of my job is doing the same thing over and over again its boring and exhausting because your constantly doing the same thing over and over again and the best thing about my job is the people seeing how nice and hard working they are makes you feel like your part of something good
good,"fast pace and energizing "
good,"Is a nice place to start a career, you learned very easily, the environment is nice, working with different ethnic people is nice. The hard part of the job is to work long hour more than 12 hrs. And the most enjoyable part of the job was free breakfast, Good recognition program."
good,the typical day at work as a picker first you log in to your scanner find your location and get to work . the good part is everybody get motivated get encouraging words and we stretch to get loose the hard part when you have to pick a item and all the way down A or up high like G and you  need a latter. Co worker or so nice and helpful the most enjoyable part of the job get the chance to win gift cards and prizes I learn to use a RF scanner and what to do if the item is not and the ben or if you cant scan the bar code it a lot of fun but you have to work hard
good,"It was a very good job on my ex-location, but unfortunately, I move from that location to another place."
good,We worked ten hours a day for four days so you get a lot of time off to spend with your family outside of work. The break rooms have arcade games and a store to buy snacks and food.
good,"My typical day consists of working safely and quickly while providing quality and quantity to make sure customers orders are first priority. I have learned how to be a positive influence on new hires while training them, how to lead production lines, and various job functions. Management varies but are there when needed and has the time for employees needs while trying to ensure shift numbers are meant. I work with various cultures as well as people with disabilities. I enjoy when the company gives out incentives for their employees for their hard work."
good,I learned a lot of things while working at Amazon.com. The managers would motivate us to work harder. Amazon is a good work environment to work at. My co workers were nice and friendly to work with.
good,"i like to work hard, an love to fun at work ! "
good,"I loved working for Amazon! It was a fast paced work place which I have to stay busy and it kept me busy. Amazon gave me the opportunity to work as a back up for the manager and a problem solver, 2 things which I absolutely loved doing. Amazon helped me come out of my shell on talking in front of others. Now I can talk in front of a group of people and it not bother me at all. Hardest part of the job to me was it was rough on my knees, walking on concrete for 10hrs a day. I had some wonderful co-workers that I was able to train and work with."
good,A normal day at work would start at 7 am and start and end positive and happy all the time. Working there was a very fast paced and exceptional place to work and be trained to gain experience in factory work. The people are very nice and understanding and the work there is easy to pick up on when you have great concious down to earth trainers and assistants. the communication skills there are absolutely exceptional. (when being taught something or having something explained correct)
good,"The job was very simple, the only difficult part was standing for at least 11 hours, but that wasn't a problem after working there for a couple months."
good,"prepare box,Scan Order, put P slip, label box, bubbles in box, close box, keep doing the same routine over and over until you gain speed."
good,"It depends what department you are in. I was in Inbound, Inbound consists of Receive, Stow, pallet receive, prep, pallet put away, and being on equipment. I did learn a lot, I was a problem solver at our Reno, NV facility. I learned just about all the processes in Inbound, management is okay, I liked all my co-workers at all 3 facilities that I worked at. The hardest part of the job, is that it is physically demanding, and that during our peak season, there is no family time."
good,"Working at Amazon is a no brainer. My building is a Sort Center, so you come in scan some packages to a pallet, wrap them up and go home. Very simple and straight forward."
good,"Amazon is one of the most employee friendly company in the world. Speaking about the work I did there was pretty amazing, I had amazing team which would support and make me feel proud whenever I did something out of the box. People are friendly and I never realized as I was working there, it was more like my second home. Times do come when the work has to be done overnight and I think I have done it right in time. Overall, I enjoyed working there."

good,"i did enjoy working here, I learned some warehoude skills and health and safety skills about working in the warehouse although I found lunch time very unreasonable. 30 mins was not long enough considering the amount of people waiting on lunch"
good,"I really enjoyed working at my present employer. My co-workers were like family.  There was a lot of turn around in management, so they were not there long enough to understand what everyone's job was.. This is a big problem.I take my job serious, because it dealt with making sure the customers had a very good experience ordering from this company."
good,"echauffement"
good,"In the department of Payments Portal of Commerce, the life work balance is well maintained. We typically start our work early in the morning around 10 am, and end at 6 pm. However, if you're on call, it's not the case, you maybe struggle with something not expected at night."
good,"Unfortunately it was only temporary work... 4 days per week 10 hours day give more free time for the worker. Overtimes payed well, so i would really stay there if its possible. Peoples said the work is hard but i think hard only for lazy ones.... hard work is not enough to keep the job at amazon though..."
good,"Very well organized, healthy work atmosphere, good opportunity for advancement and every one works with a strong sense that they are part of a team"

good,As you start you're day at work with a briefing you work non stop for 10 hours strait with only a lunch brake and two 15 min brakes. Management will always be there for you but you will always have to go to them.
good,"Amazon advertising a great step to the OOH field of advertising, I meet amazing talented people; however, it is a limited field to work . over here a person can only focus on the out of home domain. its a limited field with limited amount of learning. Although on the other hand Co-workers over here are too much supportive as well as the company management, the only reason i want to switch is over here their are no growth opportunities, in terms of salary YES but in designation NO growth opportunity. the hardest part of job is when i got brief from the client and the location which the client demanded is not available or locked by the other client. the most enjoyable part of my job is when i meet with different brand manager, marketing managers e.t.c"
good,"I am not able to speak about amazon at this time as I am under contracted privacy laws. If further information is required, I would be happy to speak more on my day to day activities and what the job that I currently do entails."
good,i enjoyed very much with all my staff members and i learned very much things in my company with the comfortable confiiction.
good,Working at Amazon is a great part time job happy employees great working environment just in general. The management team is always above there standards. I personally think there is no hard part to this job as long as you follow procedures as told. Most enjoyable part the job is meeting the new employees and training them on what you have learn.
good,A fast paced environment that requires attention to detail and versatility. With a customer centric philosophy and culture. Not for everyone but a nice place none the less.
good,"Easy to learn Processes, open for new ideas and suggestions. Great health insurance, beginning the day you walk in for your first day of work. Easy to take time off, very flexible in your vacation times and paid time off."
good,Work culture and ethics are great. Management is excellent. Facilities provided  to employees are good. More over a nice place to work
good,"It is a good place to learn but it is not a good place to have fun. People there are very nice, but the working culture isn't some I like."
good,It has been the best place to learn how to be social. I have many good things with me after joining Amazon. And whatever I'm today is because of it. I'm a proud Amazonian.

good,"Amazon has taught me how to think outside the box, manage multiple employees, and has greatly improved my collaboration ability."
good,Very well paid job that was all about customers needs and also their workers safety. Many different jobs to move to n company also.
good,"If you are looking for a job where you punch in for your 8 hours, do the same work everyday and do the same job for years, this is not the place for you. I personally enjoyed the amount of challenges at Amazon, and the great thing is you can design your own career path, find your own interests and challenges and pursue those. The experience you can have at Amazon is what you make of it, and if you put the effort in, you can quickly grow your career here. Likewise if you don't put in the effort, you may not last very long. Amazon continually pushes for process improvement, which infinitely provides great opportunities to take the initiative and own a project or process improvement from beginning to end.  They also have their own program that is a mix of LEAN and Six Sigma called ACES, and not only encourage people to participate in this but also require certain people on teams to go through the training. From what I've heard, your experience can be very different depending on the organization or department you're in, or who your manager is. I've had some good experiences with a manager that I was able to outline my goals with, and she helped to ensure those opportunities were there for my growth.  I continually got feedback and weekly 1:1 time with my manager which is great to ensure you're meeting expectations in the short-term, as well as what you can work on for your long-term goals. "
good,"TIME was the major thing at Amazon, I enjoyed the constant work and the work I was given to do. I learned how to maintain my time, how to do quality checks, and to even operate the in house driving equipment! My co-workers were interesting, for the most part they just came to get their work done and go home. The hardest part of the job was learning and getting used to operating a PIT (powered industrial truck). The most enjoyable part would be the teamwork and commitment that everyone put forth to the company!"
good,Amazon.com in Campbellsville KY is a very good job.  I only would consider leaving for another job close to the culture of Amazon.com
good,"Astronics, when I worked there, was a fun place to work. I worked in the machine shop with a bunch of guys, we were on second shift, and once I got used to the machinery and how to do the job, things were good. Management had its good days, and bad days, as any job goes. The crew was hard working, but our shifts and work allowed us to be able to have a regular life, despite working second shift. They had started to expand the plant and the machine shop, when I was laid off, so I don't know how things might have changed since then."
good,"Amazon. I have worked in many FCs over the years, each one is different but there is a driving energy behind them, the culture long a ago was a lot more potent than it is now. This is not to be taken as a bad thing. "
good,"•	Testing of fire phone, kindle device software on several variants of devices."
good,"Great company lots of benefits, great place to start your career. You can definitely grow with the company if that's something your interested in. Plenty opportunities to advance."

good,"For industrious I worked inside the Amazon building. Where i packed serveral items per hour , it was fast pace. i really enjoyed my time with Amazon"
good,"Get to work on time and swipe badge 5 minutes before the shift start is a must. The average day at Amazon consists of making sure to stretch out your muscles before starting work, after breaks, lunch, and before you leave. During the work day it is a must to make sure you make rate while at the same time providing 5 star quality on every item you ship. This job helped teach me how to work individually, as a team, and to work under pressure. The co-workers at Amazon were very helpful and made everyone feel great to be part of the Amazon team. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the day because it was a great environment to work. The most enjoyable part of working at Amazon was knowing that each day you come to work, you were going to work with the #1 online retailer to bring excitement to customers when they receive their shipment, as well as satisfaction to yourself by knowing you made sure to send quality products to millions of happy customers all around the world!"
good,"great job ,great people just needs to pay more"
good,"I ran the RMCF for about two and half years, loved the job and the people i hired to work with me. Ran the store with no complaints for two years as manager, The hardest part of the job was during Christmas and Valentines day. those were the most insane and productive days out of the whole entire year, and I enjoyed to the max."
good,"Fast Paced Warehouse "
good,"Sunday-wednesday but a lot of overtimes .I learned how to work safely in warehouse and other places as well.Management is getting bad .The reason i say that,management used to be wonderful in my warehouse but now because of creating little leaders under area managers making a lot of mess like making favourtisim among associates other than that is good management."
good,"It is the rate that drives you crazy - you race like heck and find your rate is 87.  On another day you are exhausted and walk slower and you find your rate is 115.  I have no idea why and everyone I asked all the way up to the GM does not know exactly how the rate works or why people get the numbers they get. "
good,Had poor training and spent most time figuring out how to do my job. Co- woker were really helpful .

good,"The comradery of the employees was excellent "
good,"entreprise a l'écoute de ses salariés, travail enrichissant sur le plan personnel."
good,I walk around and pick items that customers buy online.I learned how to multitask better because you have to make rate which is to pick 100 items an hour. Management is really nice and informative. My co-workers are nice. Most enjoyable part is looking how i make rate each week and they congratulate me.
good,"Durant mon experience a Amazon, j'ai été au contact de professionnel de divers régions (Chinois, allemand, Irlandais, francais, Italians...)"
good,"Debout 5h pour commencer à 5h50 au site d'Amazon Montélimar"
good,The company was overall a great place to work for.  It was a very fast paced company that worked off production rates.  Excellent benefits.  Management was easy to get along with.  The work was very strenuous. Got me in great shape.

Providing detailed information regarding p.m.'s  doing Trouble tickets when time permits creating work orders for all calls, trouble tickets, and for any significant down time needed repairs/replacements on equipment that was discovered.  logging 100% of your time on duty."
good,"if  you choose to work at amazon you better get very good walking shoes i got cross trainers  its the best diet ever we walked any where from 5 to 10 miles a day  and i was in shipping  one of the least walked areas "
good,overall a good place to work but be ready to be told you need to move faster even if you improved from the last time you were informed you werent meeting their expected hourly rates
good,"Everybody on the job was willing to work as a team even the managers, always helpful and understanding."
good,"The job done in the Retail Business Services for a catalog associate is to create ASINs for the products available on site. And maintaining the huge Database. Documentation of the listed products and make necessary changes if required. My shifted started at 8:30 A.M and ends at 5:30."
good,If you like doing the same thing over and over again amazon is a good place to work. The hours are long and all the jobs are repetitive. After getting into a rhythm you can go on autopilot and wait for the shift to be over.
good,"* Fun at Training Period regarding about our products"
good,"A typical work day consisted of long hours, but fast hours. Massage chair, ping pong table, video game, basketball court, etc. during break. The most enjoyable part about the job was satisfying the customers."
good,I enjoyed going to work and during the holidays we got a dj to come in and we got to listen to music while we worked. My manager and co workers were always a lot of fun. The hardest part was only that i worked midnights. The most enjoyable was all the people i got to meet and friends I made while i worked there.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering phones, and assisting customers with their games/software needs, including troubleshooting, walkthroughs, and referrals to vendors or manufacturers."
good,PTO time is accepted as time that can be used whenever you want (no questions from mgmt).  Easy to make friends with co-workers.  Great benefits!
good,"foi muito bom porem com alguns desafios"
good,love meeting the people I worked with and the bosses where good
good,"Seriously, the best part of my job is without a doubt the people that I work with. Everyone is always ready to help and encourage one another. That has definitely helped me become a more confident person.Is having the freedom to express myself – to laugh when I need to de-stress; to speak and actually be heard, and to perform not just because I’m paid to do it but because I’m inspired to be the best."
good,"I worked for Amazon.com in India as an Investigator-Intern dealing with sensitive seller data on Amazon platform and looking for any possible fraudulent activity, by considering the large data thrown by the system tools regarding their personal and financial whereabouts. "
good,"There has only two shift per day (will add 3rd shift later). I have been learned how to get the productions and sent it to people who ordered them through online. There is kind of good management. There is very friendly co-workers. There is about 5,000 workers. Many people said there is hardest some area but to me, not too hardest part of the job.

good,"always a lot of moving around speed and accuracy. Learned many things about computers, scanners and pallet jacks and other things. management was really great at getting everything running smooth and simple. co-workers were awesome i miss them too haha. the hardest part of the job was making quota i would say since there was alot of the quota to be met. lunch best part of the day i guess its every part of the day for any job but other than that was after lunch more relaxed work place."
good,I was a picker so i would go down the modes and pick items and put them in a tote and send them on the conveyor belt.
good,"A warehouse full of life & enthusiastic people willing to do what it takes to do the job right. The hardest part of the job is not getting off task by looking at all the exciting products going down the line. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction you get knowing that whatever you picked, packed, sorted, or shipped will be arriving to customers all over the world with a smile."
good,"I worked as a picker packer, job was fun but had to flex up. I enjoyed meeting new people, my management was helpful, I learned to work without rest, to work through busy time, to be a good worker."
good,Had a good time walking around the warehouse meeting new people
good,"When I was working at amazon I worked at a station and work off a computer screen. I had to scan the product wait for the paperwork to come off the printer then pack the product and add the receipt for customer into the package."
good,The company is the best of the beginners. Give an ample time and opportunities to grow and understand the BPO culture. Lovely environment to work and maintain balance between personal life and professional life.
good,"A typical day at Amazon was very busy, never a dull moment at the job.  A typical work day consisted of 10 hour shifts, 4 days a week.  It was surprising that as big as the company was, and the specific job site, management was very aware and intune with all of the employees. "
good,"A typical day at Amazon Integrity was very fast paced and productive.  Everyday there was a rate that had to be met so there was no time for games.  Management was always refreshing and willing to help, as were my co-workers.  The hardest part about working at Amazon Integrity was meeting 90% of the rate each day, but after doing it for about a week or so it became an easy task.  The most enjoyable part about my job was knowing that the work I am doing is making another person somewhere in the world happy."
good,"Stand up, with stretches to get ready for work.  Find job duty for day."

good,Great place to work with opportunities to advance in management
good,I did like this job a lot but again it was only available for seasonal hours. I was a picker for the company of Amazon. Worked everyday 10 hour days.
good,"I did everything from dock to dock including stocking, picking, packing and transporting using all kinds of personal industrial trucks (PIT). The number of employees was nice so many different people made many friends over the years. The hardest part was 4th quarter getting geared up for Christmas insane pace, stress and long hours."
good,"The atmosphere and people at Amazon are great, but the job can be very draining in the long-term. You begin to feel like you live only to be at work, and talking to the same ten archetypes for days on end on the phone can make you want to scream. They do work their best to keep you happy, but unfortunately their best isn't always enough."
good,"I have learnt how to analyze the Fraudulent activities taking place on Credit Cards, also to keep the customers satisfy which is the main motto of Amazon.com. Each individual is answerable for their own work, so makes each one of us responsible. Co workers are the best in this company. Better than any other place. Hardest part of the job being in different shifts every quarter, being unable to plan an outing with colleagues due to shifts/offs being different."
good,Well work is pretty simple you go in work to meet your quota and then you are good to go!
good,"A typical day involved fielding calls from customers who had questions or complaints about their orders.  You do your best to correct the problems, and you're given more discretion on handling complaints than you will at most any other job of this kind.  On the negative side, you're not allowed very much time to remedy what are sometimes complex problems.  This works against the customer-centric culture Amazon works so hard to build."
good,"Is a grate job, good money. Just didnt have alot of time with son and puts alot on your body."
good,"Walk 15miles a day on a 10 hours shift. Dealing with non heavy material. I learned alot about how I collect customers oders, the management is not so great with communitcation between co workers and managers, dont really have a hard just just alot of walking involved and the thing I enjoy most about my job is training to hires during the holidays."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. It is a fun and fast-paced environment. It is rewarding to help customers with their online purchasing needs.
good,"The job is not for the slow paced or lazy, you are constantly on your feet and moving around all most all the time and you had to keep a calm and cool head to come up with ways to stay in pace with everyone else and come up with good solutions to daily problems."
good,Amazon.com strives to be Earth's Most Customer Centric Company. This is the most important Company saying as agents give their all on every single contact/call and agents receive the same regard as internal customers.
good,"Fun, laidback environment! Call volumes can be hectic, but helping customers is very fulfilling."
good,"I got hired to Amazon through Integrity Staffing Solutions. A typical day at work for me was clock in, grab a cart and scan it, locate shelves to store the items, scan the items into the bin, break, repeat, lunch, repeat, clock out. I learned out how to use scanners and how to work in warehouse conditions. Amazon management and their employees were great, but the ISS was not. The hardest part of working at Amazon under ISS was the pressure they put on you. They expected you to be as fast and efficient in two weeks as those who worked their for years, and when you're not, you get 'let go'. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I was making."
good,"When you work in Amazon,you feel very good,because the people with who you work are amazing. In there im learn everything what i must need or know."
good,my role at amazon was either to pack ship or manual slam those are the things i learned at amazon and i was relly good at them the management were greatand very helpful when needed the hardest part of the job was to keep your targets up even when your ask to do many different jobs and the most enjoyable part of that job was working with my friends and just doing a good job
good,"As i worked at day shift (7a.m-3p.m) the hardest part of the job was to get up early. However, it was the most enjoyable part, as i finished early as well. All managers and co-workers were very nice and polite, so the working atmosphere was friendly."
good,You are on your feet the entire time powerwalking to locate and scan items at a particular rate. So no matter how fast you are moving if u dont make rate it really doesnt matter. My co-workers are really nice. Management is very polite but tough. I learned how to read numbers in a way that I am more efficient with timely tranport to conveyer belt for packing and shipping.I like the fact that I am losing weight due to the constant moving on the job.
good,I am manage and am responsible for the outbound/inbound department where I manage labor work force of 40+ associates.
good,"This is a great place to work, great people, good job security accept for managment. The managment team has a higher turn over rate than I have ever seen anywhere. The hardest part of the job is during peak season when you are on mandatory 60 hr weeks, but atleast the paychecks look good"

good,"During my time working at Amazon it has been a good experience and I was able to learn and grow in the company very quickly. The company is customer driven and strive for excellence. Also, encourage employees to better themselves and engage in workshops or express ideas to better the company."
good,"I enjoyed working as a fulfillment associate for Amazon Prime. There were various job assignments which I liked, as it keeps you from being bored and you stay busy, which makes the time go by quickly."
good,I really love working here and love to get the packages to the customer on time. It is hard work and a fast pace job and loved the consistency of packages after package.
good,"Gran organización y ambiente laboral, salarios y beneficios excelentes. Para ciertos cargos no se ofrece estabilidad laboral, contratos temporales que afectan la experiencia."
good,Great company to grow in and obtain knowledge in. The work is fairly simple and easy to learn and perform. The pay range is fairly high do to the work and the hours of work can be long so it's a great company to make extra money if necessary.
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for. Started out as a seasonal employee. Quickly realized I enjoyed working in this environment, so I made the transition to a permanent employee. Gained more responsibilities over the months I worked there."
good,"Don’t apply through integrity. Trust me on this. Less than a week after my conversion was approved, I was laid off. By integrity. Apparently, they were supposed to call or email me to tell me I was laid off. Extremely unprofessional. "
good,At times I feel managers don’t make the best decisions in terms of what is best both equally for the employees and the customers. I don’t know what else to say ok
good,Working with Amazon was very different but an interesting learning experience. I enjoyed working with the company and would definitely consider joining them again.
good,learned how to operate within an amazon fulfillment center. Ability to pick up extra shifts when they're offered which allows you to learn other areas of their warehouse operations that you'd otherwise not learn based on your base shift schedule. Good workplace culture.
good,"I was happy  to work for amazon,because the traite employees  with respect, and their benefit are good,they are many benefits you can choose , is the best"
good,"Amazon is the best place to work where you can learn a lot, specially the managers are really nice specially in my shift my manager Joe he is very nice person he helps me a lot to learn new skills he never put the pressure on his workers he knows how to manage his team to get better out come ."

good,There is always work to do there. The workers are nice and very helpful. The manager take pleasure into helping the workers and if you ever have a problem the managers are willing to sit down and help.
good,"Hard work of packing."
good,"Been with Amazon 4+yrs. Their is a lot of room to grow and develop, but only if you are willing to put in the work. It is no necessarily a job that you stay at the same level with for a long period of time. It is a great job work at, while you pursue the career field that you want to go into."
good,"Good job, worked with school schedule. If being in your feet all day and always staying busy this is the job for you. Personally, see a lot of room to grow."
good,This job is extremely physical if you are not used to a job like this. The 4 day work weeks and 3 days off in a row was great and the pay was great. People you work with make a difference when you need a little help.
good,"I have not worked at a company prior where I know 100% of what is expected of me at all times. Amazon is a very simple job in the sense you are handed production goals and the tools to meet those goals. It is hard work and long hours, breaks and lunches are always at the same time and some roles you do not interact with others more then a few minutes every few hours other roles enjoy a ton of interaction. Everything at amazon is hands on and you jump in fast. There are a lot of friendly faces, managers and process assistants that want to see your peers succeed, it is easy to make friends with the persons in your group and if needed someone is there to help when a questions arises. "
good,While working at Amazon i had a great experience. The management was helpful in training new employees and work conditions where very fair. From the very start it was a comfortable environment with room to advance.
good,"Your day will generally consist of moving packages of all shapes and sizes, whether it be off of trucks or into delivery bags. The work load is reasonable most of the time."
good,Very productive and fun place to work that gives their employees time to spend with family. Very laid back and willing to help their employees within work schedules.
good,"This is a very demanding job with excellent benefits. It's a great place to work. Set schedule. Only issue is when it's slow. Always keeping busy which I enjoy, management does a good job and coworkers are very friendly. Everyone helps each other out and are all friendly for the most part."
good,It's a fun filled  intensive and demanding place to work . Your personality trait and emotional management are essential as in other work environment.
good,"Great company to work for, as long as you’re physically capable, and mentally strong since most of the work you do is by yourself. Especially if you’re a picker, take care of your feet."
good,"Distributed packages and documents for institutions, businesses, government agencies, and individuals. Received assignments by phone and wireless data service. Delivered packages in a timely manner, with efficiency. Verified and maintained manifest with load to assure accurate count of merchandise for every stop."
good,Great place to work. I enjoyed a lot over there and also worked there as a SME for last 6 months. Everyone was supportive and helpful. They have a open door policy which i liked most.
good,"Great benefits and a bit physical job if you don't mind lifting heavier items. If you do your job well, you can easily move up to better positions. Enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"Amazon used to be a relaxed and chill workplace,however they have made many changes that it became so stressful without any fun.(Especially for VCS folks and associates)"
good,The work which you do everyday some times feels very routine and you might get bored. You don't get much to learn if you are in a non technical process. The management and culture of work is fun loving and very professional at the same time.
good,"I really admire Amazon to reach me the few basics which are very essential for anyone. Particularly the people who want to be leaders and build their career in the Management track."
good,Everything was overall well put together all of the staff and management were well structured and the security was one of the best I've seen overall it was a good experience
good,Good facilities and a great work environment with great and leadership. Safety always comes first and its the most important like number one work ethics.
good,"long standing for 12 hours shifts with only 2 breaks, job is physical you become an industrial athlete and you get a decent rate of pay"
good,"Very good work culture . If u complete your task on time, no one will mess with you. But because of the hierarchy and new managers work culture is spoiling and converting into a BPO."
good,Mon parcours chez Amazon est super bien . Car je ne m ennuie pas.
good,"This is a call center vs inside sales, quotas everyday.  Management does want everyone to succeed. "
good,I like amazon. I just don't like the fact that we have a point system. They also don't work with your schedule. I'm currently in school full-time. They really don't care.
good,"Challenging and rewarding work with excellent opportunities for advancement as well as stellar compensation and benefits packages.  Huge emphasis on safety, customer satisfaction and hitting goals.  Very team oriented and casual environment, but the business at hand is always the driving factor."
good,"I have been doing Amazon flex for 2 months.  I love helping the people!  It means the world to me.  The"
good,great place to work fast pace job as a  Stower   there  a percent  quota  per week of 100 percent that must be met other wise it is a great place to work for the work days are Wednesday  Thur  Saturday  7 am to 530 pm  or Sunday  Thur Wednesday 730 am to 600 pm the location was In Lebanon TN  at 500 Duke DR
good,Very great company to work for. I would suggest you do your research and see that Amazon is the best thing in Seattle. Especially with everything growing as fast as it is.
good,"Very safe, productive, fast paced (time flies), inclusive, flexible, and enjoyable workplace. There is a lot of room to move up to any position you're interested in."
good,"There was no interview. I took an assessment online and was then told I would be contacted to complete the hiring process. I had an appointment to complete the hiring process were I had a drug test, signed paperwork, and had a photo taken. Then I started within 1-2 weeks. I had health problems arise shortly after starting my position with the company. I was able to take PAID medical leave several times over the first year. They worked with me through it all and everyone was incredibly understanding from management to HR to Amazon's Leave Team. The health benefits started on day one and for someone with a lot of medical needs, I was extremely thankful. The work is very repetitive and mundane and not for everyone. The initial training program was thorough and staff would help if you had questions. They also had weekly on-boarding sessions for new staff. Staff was not initially friendly (at this location) but after some time at the warehouse, I believe that is due to the high turnover rate. They do not waste their time befriending until you've been there for a while. Amazon would constantly give incentives or perks. Weekly, Red Robin would come in during lunch so employees could purchase food onsite. They frequently had free food days - fruit, tacos, sundaes, etc. During training they are honest about the level of physical activity. Although I found that I did more miles a day as a picker (on the floor) than they estimated. I did from 8-12 miles a day of walking, more often closer to 12mi. They estimate from 5-10 miles a day."
good,"You will never feel like not going to work if you are a part of Amazon. There are definitely some flaws and drawbacks but that's the thing, isn't it. Who is perfect?"
good,"Everyone is very friendly and happy and you learn a lot about the job and also the management is great they are very cool people to always talk to, it’s really fun to be around the people there."
good,Love this location for work. wonderful management and team work environment. Only worked as sesonal part time employee then found full time work but a great company to work for.
good,Good place to work with a variety of different backgrounds where you can learn off each other. Great with people management at the site I work but don't know how it is at other sites.
good,"Die Arbeit ist in Ordnung, Alle Mitarbeiter und Kollegen sind sehr freundlich."
good,"This is a very good organization to grow your self in every way. The hard you work here the more you achive here."
good,"I enjoyed working for amazon in indiana I currently moved to Florida . The job location was great and the environment . Very diverse culture and everybody was very helpful , a lot of good trainings."
good,The workplace diversity and leadership principles are very helpful to excel in one's respective role. There are ample opportunities available for one to explore and work which makes employees strive towards success.
good,"An Amazon warehouse is a good place to work. It's fast and you have to be hitting certain rates every week like the rest of the warehouse associates to stay on track. After the one month training period, you'll get the hang of it. Be safe and be careful at all times, not your ordinary workplace."
good,A typical day at work and i learned management skill in work and really life and workplace is Diversty and family culture and friendly hardest part is rateing and most enjoyable part is friendly and fun
good,"Helping to support the daily management of the department, making sure all barriers are resolved for the associates to have a productive day.  I have learned with working at Amazon is to multitask, stay positive, always being present on your floor to be available for all associates for barriers they accrue on a daily basis, which will provide service for our customers. I have been very blessed to say the management I have worked with has developed me into a Leader. I am still learning new processes within the facility and ready to take the next step to become an L4. I have been with Amazon for almost 5 years I started as a level 1 inbound stow, problem-solver and auditor. There is so much opportunity to grow with the company and I have been a  Tier, 3 Process Assistants, Feild Transportation Specialist, and currently a Learning Trainer. I will honestly say the hardest part of the job is not having weekends off and all holidays off to spend with my family. which all live out of state. What makes me go to work is my associates it's a great feeling when you can help someone and make a difference to better our customer experience, which is always my top priority."
good,"Callaborative team culture join a fun forward thinking and dynamic team"
good,"If you're great at your job they ask for you to join think groups to work on process improvement, train others, and take on special projects. Usually each AM takes on two within the department to help coach them into leads called process guides (PG). The guides for each department usually have the first chance at an interview for the assistant manager position come peak. If you excel during peak season you have the chance to stay on as a PA once the peak season has ended."
good,"it's nice to work, I learned a lot of warehouses works, the management they are friendly, and the company was great mostly the benefits of their employees."
good,"I liked working in Amazon. It was challenging, but fun. It had difficult and different tasks to do, fast work with good organisation. Unfortunately, the job was temporary."
good,"Quick days as always fast paced, team briefs were every morning and set targets. Very friendly work environment and managers were always willing to help."
good,It's a good job but if you dont like to walk this job isn't job you. It's kinda like going grocery shopping but you never know where the item you looking for might end up at.
good,i had a good time working at Amazon. I didn't want to leave but they didn't have short term leave of absence for part time employees. I wanna go back!
good,You have to be physically fit to work t amazon. You are on your feet all day and you have to meet production everyday. Once your body gets used to it the job isn't that hard.
good,A workplace with peaceful work atmosphere and enjoyable work. Sometimes during peak seasons the workload increases but with increase in fun and good team culture.
good,"Amazon was a fun place for me to work. It was a very challenging place, as the expectations are very high, but it was easy to push yourself to succeed."
good,Amazon Company provide good environment for work . Amazon service is also good. Departmental managers are always support to juniors. Pick and drop facility is fine.
good,"good environment to work in,just need a car and it would be easier otherwise its the travelling to and from work that kills you,hours are ok,you just gotta be ok with being tired all the time"
good,"Amazon offers many opportunity for career advancement. The company has different departments to work for and transfers are available for those who qualify. Also,if you looking to relocate throughout your career Amazon is the company to work for."
good,La única pega es que era una nave temporal y no teníamos aire acondicionado en pleno verano y moviendo bultos muy pesado. Por lo demás no tengo quejas.
good,"Been with Amazon for one week now and it's been on absolute pleasure so for working  at this place. I love working in a fast paste environment, because I don't like been at work hanging around without notting to do. So, for me I don't mind working here for the next 10- 15 year's"
good,"I loved my job at Amazon working from home. I would still be there if my Landlord hadn't sold the property I was renting and had to move somewhere else. I moved, but my new place hadn't been wired for cable, phone and internet and it was two weeks before I got connected. I called in everyday to let them know I couldn't work and after finally working I was let go. I was so hurt just when I was about to become a full-time employee with benefits."
good,Everyone there has a great attitude and is committed to their job. Great for people who can work any shift or have a lot of free time since they allow you to pick up extra shifts sometimes or stay extra time. Not great for anyone looking to make good money from the start since it takes 3 months to become fulltime and until the. You can only work 20-25 hours a week.
good,Typical day at work is only about work with funs which you can't expect to calm your minds. Learned a lot about communication and convincing customers. Management are cool to approach and solve the greviances and ensure every process is smooth. Workplace is fllled with many newbies. Hardest part of Job is inability to solve customer problems on some occasions but can only convince them.
good,I am working as a vendor receiver in amazon from last one month.Amazon is great place for work.Manager is very supporting and helping.Amazon provding gud salaries and benefits to emplyess
good,"I really enjoyed being able to work from home on a schedule that fit my family's needs. There could be difficult calls that took more out of you than  expected, but your management was right there and always willing to help, support, and encourage you along the way. "
good,I just wish that Amazon would do much better and to watch people how they work and not ordering them around cause Amazon isn't all that most of the time
good,"Me siento feliz ver tenido estas experiencias,pero no deseo trabajar más de noche"
good,Alles in allem war ich dort sehr zufrieden........
good,"Enjoyed the job, did not enjoy the heat. No air conditioner. Really easy job. I did packing and we packed ithems from 1 pd to 50 pd. Probably would of stayed if they had air."
good,It was fun and energetic. Pay is great.  It was easy work. Very undertsanding management. Hours and scheduling was great. Benefits are worth it.!!!!!!!
good,"You're always on your feet and there's always something to do. Very Fast pace, especially during the holiday seasons. It was very hard at first, and time seemed to go super slow, however, once you found your pace and great coworkers to work together made so much better."
good,Hard to get started but once learned the job was rewarding. Learned so much from each manager I worked under. Looking forward to applying the skills to future jobs
good,"Mi occupavo di ricevimenti e controllo qualità, imballaggio e soluzionare problemi in base a ogni tipo di prodotto non conforme,"
good,I will apply again for seasonal work. It was nice. Good to know that the first time work experience with Amazon will be memorable. Safety is number one priority
good,"From the very first day the management team were very welcoming and patient during the training process. We were greeted with easy-to-understand instructions that helped achieve our daily metrics and helped keep our work space clean and running efficiently. Overall, it made the management team very approachable and the intimidation of relaying any professional concerns almost non-existent."
good,"Many product line and more opportunity , great culture, more number of teams and services , great employee management, nice building , great benefits, good salary"
good,"Great Culture, Great Learning, Fast-paced environment. At times stressful, but well balanced overall. A lot of opportunities to learn from your peers."
good,"Job is mostly easy, but there was minimal training available (probably due to the location recently opening when I started). Job can be very tedious and some-times there were so many lows that the minimum weekly hours were cut in half. Position is part-time only, but there have been days when extra time was offered (few and far between, as we were over-staffed). Not too many options available to move-up in the company as you're told. But they do try to make the day go by fast and make it as enjoyable as possible. Day-shift (4-5 hours per day at 5 days) or night-shift (8 hours days at 3 days). Be careful of weather - as things can turn dangerous really quick (i.e., wind can unexpectedly blow over racks, icy or wet floors make for a slip/trip/fall hazard, cold and hot weather can be a pain)."
good,"Vary interesting place to work. People are great, and as long as you do your best everything should be ok. Working Nights is good, but it does interfere with work life balance because you are always up at night on your days of and it does make it difficult to do anything social. Other than that it is a great place"
good,"Le travail était très bien organisé suivant les mesures de sécurité et motivent les travailleurs à suivre ces règles pour leur propre sécurité, avec un bon rythme"
good,"Working at amazon was very interesting and exciting for me, because it help me recognize how fast and active i had to be. Amazon was really helpful to me because it help me prepare for a fast paced environment."
good,amazon is very much employee committed. with flexible home work schedules they make it easy to come to work. they have lots of incentives to keep you comfortable through the long work hours
good,I just cant wait to get to work and get my shift going! Great people! Talking with my fellow employees really easy! Job is fast paced. Keeps the day flowing and steady.
good,Fun place to work but they will let you go for no real pay reason. Pay is good but job security is poor. AM are nice LP will get you fired always watching.
good,It was a great plcae to work. Leaving early on first day was allowed because other part time job didnt allow switching the schedule. So i quit the part time job.
good,It was a good experience working at Amazon. It was simple and easy. Fast pace long hours. Fun team members. The paychecks was the best part of working there.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon.com, I loved the work place, my colleagues & everyone in the building . It was really fun working there during the Peak Sesson & even though it was under pressure half of the time."
good,I loved working with Amazon during the holiday season.   They gave out awesome prizes. I had great coworkers.  The management team was very helpful and did not mind filling in when needed.  I would have stayed but we had shift changes that did not work for my lifestyle.
good,I enjoyed working here and had a fun time learning new things and worked hard. meals there are cheap and nutritious too including all vitamins and nutrients to maintain energy levels to keep work rate steady throughout the day
good,productive and fun workplace good  working envirment friendly manajment good benefits good working hours transportation provided good and exeptable salary
good,"When I stared was a good job,they always congrats you for your efforts,they teach you how to work correctly and work safely,very good co-worker,lead and managers."
good,The job of a fulfillment associate was straight-forward but wasn't always easy due to seasonality. The workplace-culture and the people you meet make up the difference as it was always a fun environment and overall a positive experience.
good,"work culture was good as well as so many good thing related to this company like increment,boss,and strategy for business development,"
good,"One the best place to balance work life, and learned a lot in terms of professional and in terms of personal. "
good,"Waking up early, cup of coffee. Started the day, break at 11. Finished the second half of the day. 2 breaks in between start of shift, lunch, and the end of the shift. Good place to work, I would work there again."
good,"is a good place for work, you can increse into the company. There a good envirosment of work. they have good benefits. Have care over the workers. Is a safety and clean place for work."
good,"I greatly enjoyed the physical labor that came with working in the warehouse, and the conditions did not bother me until I became injured about 2.5 weeks after starting. While the A3P relocation program sounded like a great opportunity, and I was originally thankful to be able to continue working somewhere with my injury, continuation of work did prevent healing. Furthermore, it was very difficult figuring out who to contact whenever I had a question of any sort, and communication between departments was not efficient. That being said, I enjoyed doing the job I originally applied for, even if only for 2.5 weeks, and my managers were approachable and available during my shift. I would like to note that this position was stressful, as making rate was often difficult, but the managers seemed to be understanding as long as you put effort into your work."
good,Clock in 1 hour early setup the equipment so when the workers clock in everything is set up and there is no delay . Walk the warehouse make sure associates have completed there task the set up induction board for the following day
good,They work you really hard. Don’t really care for employees. Hard to get extra hours off. But good pay and great benefits. Managers were very nice and helpful
good,$15 and it's a great job because of all the benefits. The only down side is alot of body pains to to intense fast pace at a nonstop rate. The bonus was amazing too. You work 4 days 10hrs and have three days off.
good,Job is easy and enjoyable. Time goes by quickly. They make sure we exercise daily. Everyone is friendly and happy. The job isn’t stressful at all. Everything is done at a steady pace. Good pay and benefits
good,Driver carrier for Amazon. Receive company van. Delivery packages to Amazon Customers at a timely manner. Have to be able to know how to use a smart phone device to complete your deliveries
good,Would still be there today if I didn't endure a few medical issues!
good,Everything depends on how you perform and keeping good connections. Helpful management. Managers and team is friendly and helpful. Cab facility is not free.
good,"you work 10 hour days. management can be very good.very fast pace, must meet production goals,you get to meet a wide veriety of people,make good friends."
good,Amazon is going to rule the world one day. that's why I believe is a great company to work work for. So many great opportunities 2 advance anywhere in Amazon.
good,"Very laid back, no cellphones allowed in the warehouse. Long work hours, very hot on the line. Standing on feet all day. They will cross train you in different parts of the warehouse."
good,"A high paced and hard working job, but with a great culture. Management was quick about solving problems and coming up with innovative solutions with help from team members."
good,"Amazon a"
good,I would come into work and each shift would have stretching and exercise warm ups to do before their shift began which I thought was really awesome because it showed how much the management cares about their employees. Everyone was very nice to work with and the breaks were generous with each shift.
good,"A typical at work is busy, fast paced, relaxing. I learned to stay focus on the job I'm doing.  Management was helpful, relaxed which helps me to relax. workplace culture was fun no drama. I like to go back to work for them. The hardest part of the job was the lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers."
good,"I learned  very key components about warehouse work. I had good teachers who cared about the company and the customer. The culture was good, a team effort was always given. The lesson learned at amazon i will be able to apply to other jobs for the rest of my life."
good,"I enjoyed working Amazon Flex , it paid very well as long as you could find shifts to except. You would receive notices if a shift/block was available. You could except the shift , but it was first come , first serve. If you were not fast enough someone else could take the shift. Once you had a shift you would go to the warehouse at the time specified and receive your packages.The wait for the package area to be ready was sometimes long and would cause your shift to run over time , which you do not get paid for. After verifying that you had all the packages for your route the app would tell you where to go and who was next. Your job was to attempt to deliver all packages. Sometimes people were not at home so you would have to return packages to the warehouse that you couldn't safely leave. It was a fairly easy job. The hardest parts were rush hour traffic times , and sometimes you would have many third floor apartments which was hard on my knees. Also some apartments were a little confusing the way they were set up. Other than those things I really enjoyed delivering for amazon."
good,"The job was fast-paced, demanding at times, and stressful.  Management was very approachable and tried to keep it a fun place to work.  I would recommend this job to most people."
good,"A typical operations day consisted on making sure our customers were the priority. Always focus to achieve a high number of quality results. Our team was very friendly, but more communication was needed to achieve better results. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks we got to relax and grow as a team. I'd say this role has helped me see how giant companies operate and how there could always be improvement. While the most difficult part was getting our managers to understand that we had sufficient and quality data collected to convince that the study was a complete success."
good,Amazon had a lot of benefits for myself and my family. Its a great company to work for and with hard work and dedication you are able to move up very quickly with the company.
good,"good company to work for , sky is the limit for this company, i will recommend anyone to work for this company, it can be better in terms of family life"
good,"I worked very hard at the job with great joy for my hard work , and helping others at the job where ever they needed help there I was helping putting many boxes in the right place to be shipped out."
good,"Good place to work around your schedule."
good,"Pros - Fast growing company. Will allow to expand your capabilities and reach as much as you are willing to push yourself. "
good,Amazon is a fast pace job not for the weak heart you will be on your feet for 10 to 12 hours a day working 40 to 60 hours a week sometimes a good place to work
good,"I enjoyed Amazon and their work culture, the team is much like family. Everyone is willing to help if you need it as well. I would recommend to a friend."
good,Its is what it is but great part-time  job for those who are actively looking for full time work or in school. Pay and benefitsare pretty good as well.
good,i would definitely recommend this as a place to be however the shifts do take its toll on your life. If you are flexible and innovative you can definitely go beyond statue at this company but if you have a family or enjoy your social life then amazon isnt the best place for you
good,I like how we get there clock in get into our Van's drive over to the station to go get our routes for the day then the rest of the time were on the road till we're done with our routes and depending on if I have to do something after work I love to go help others out
good,Ambiance de travail agréable et conviviale. Je recommande
good,"alright for short-term, possibilty to work over time, bonuses, chance to move up, good athmosphere at work."
good,Its a fun place to work. This is a fast paced environment so if you don't work quickly then don't apply. The only thing bad about the company is that its hard to get promoted. They hire out instead of in house. Which in my opinion they don't trust the staff they have. Overall a great place to work.
good,"La tipica giornata di lavoro inizia con una parte di briefing durante il quale si organizza la gestione del turno insieme al manager."
good,"Perfect place to work with little to no experience, decent benefits and great opportunities for furthering your career, wether that is at this or other field."
good,"I worked at 2different locations I was at cmh2 (shipping&packing) in Groveport oh & DCM1 (sorter)in columbus oh. I was a rehire when I went to dcm1 so a lot of things were different.  I guess they're on a point system with attendance which is better then hours. But since I had just had a baby the heavy lifting was too much to endure. Good pay, but I just couldn't stay. I needed more time to heal. I went back too soon."
good,"Amazon offered good benefits and a structured schedule. Regular pay raises, overtime, health, dental, vision insurance. Management was organized and ready to help when we needed."
good,"Fast pace, competitive, but once you advance the job becomes more and more ez-er as you go. If you plain to make a career out of your stay at amazon then your on the road to success. Some days will be header then others due to the long hours and shout brakes. The pay is great and due to the fact that your tired as spit when you get off its not hard to stack $$$."
good,"Hard to have/enjoy breaks with it being ""pick to pick""....two-thirds of breaks are spent trying to rush to and from the break area.  My only real complaint."
good,"You have many shifts to choose from. 4 -10hour shifts at $15 per hour or 3- 12hour shifts(overnight thurs-sundays at $17 per hour.. Even part time who only work Saturdays and Sundays..The medical and other BENEFITS ARE AMAZING..Just medical for 1 person is only $26 dollars a month and it's awesome. It was better but it changed this year. A little more , but still better than I've seen before..Most departments are monotonous work but fast paced. "
good,"I enjoy working at Amazon. The people are friendly, and we work as a team. Management is awesome. They offer competitive compensation and great benefits."
good,The job is fast-paced and busy and there is no room for being slack until your lunch or break. You have to be on your feet all day until your break time but there was a lot of overtime and bonus payouts.
good,Delivery is fast paced but also mapped out. GPS system is good but not great. They offer time blocks in 3-4 hour increments and you can pick from what's available.
good,"Amazing place to work at, incredible growth opportunities which can help you grow at a rapid pace and there is work flexibility, where the company culture aligns with your needs."
good,Check board to see where your magnet-picture of you-located to the job you are assign to.Sometimes pit or equipment was out of place.The people were nice to work with.
good,"Me parece una empresa que desarrolla valores y skills muy valuables que ahora puedo utilizar en hoteleria y no en una oficina o call center."
good,"Loved working for a company that not only cares for the quality of their customers' products, but also cares very deeply in the organization as a whole."
good,"my first day at work was stressful"
good,"Good place to work, but if you make a tiny mistake including safety wise it could get into a termination, even after you’ve been there for years. They have no heart inside."
good,It’s a great job to work at if u like Fast pace  The hours are lovely to make easy money you got a little work hard to work fast. The job is not hard if you like work it will be a good job for u
good,"Depending on your perspective, Amazon jobs are fun and interesting, the only downside is the luck you have with the management and team leaders. Some of then are not professionals and are pushing you to your limits. sometimes you are associated with a number in the company and not a real person."
good,"Great place to work "
good,Working at Amazon was a great learning experience. The environment was fast-paced and dynamic but opportunity for growth was immense. They have a great work culture but finding work-life balance was a challenge.
good,I had the best manager ever. But corporate decided the Amazon store locations should shut down. But overall the position was defiantly a great learning experience.
good,"If you like to be kept busy, amazon is a great place to work. It is very fast paced and requires a lot of lifting within limited time but co workers are always willing to help if you are behind. No one goes to lunch unless everyone is done."
good,"I understand packages need to move, need to get out (quantity), but if you have a hard worker who cares about the product they put out (quality) & has a decent rate, I don’t see why they cannot move on to a permanent position. Where I felt like the cherry pickers, easy out, take the easy work coworkers get to stay. There are good & not so good things that go on, but overall I would work here again."
good,"The team cares for each other "
good,"STL6/7 was a phenomenal place to work at. There was a perfect balance of having some fun but also getting work done. I worked mostly in the Outbound Ship dock. They moved me where i was best. However working at STL4, not as loose per se. They did have fun. But there was a lot of serious. I was working my butt off in a station that was not my strong suit. I made sure I let them know. But i was getting write ups for not being ""productive enough"". I was working hard just like everyone else. i just wasn't as fast. but i still got punished for it. The managers tried to help but no matter what they did it still wan't enough."
good,Amazon is a great place to work it show me difference skill I didn't know I could do it you like difference challenge this the place to be enjoy wprking with my co worker
good,"Amazon was overall a good positive work environment. However, picking products does get over repetitive. The warehouse I worked at had 1 paid break and unpaid lunch."
good,"The pay was really good and the targets helped me know when i needed to improve."
good,A typical day at work is very hectic. Some months a lot of meetings happen. You always have to be on the go and also making sure that all your deadlines are always met
good,"This is best organisation I have worked so far."
good,"I really enjoyed being a driver for delivery of packages."
good,If you are looking for a flexible work schedule amazon is definitely a place to consider looking for a job. It is a fast pace environment where you will be on your feet for the whole shift so wear appropriate foot wear.
good,"I worked at Amazon for about a year. It was tough to learn all the requirements and adjustments at first, however it was not too overbearing. The managers and the coworkers got along quite well and communication was key."
good,"Come in go to huddle for exercise and brief meeting. then get cage, and assigned to assembly and packing line. get cubical ready for packing, and pack as many packages as possible with the best accuracy as possible."
good,I have built my Amazon store over the past 12 months to sales of over 45k per month.  I am looking forward to increasing the sales.  What I do not like is that they've gotten rid of phone support for Seller Central business owners.
good,Good company. Gets old after 2 years. Average employee lasts 2 years. Writing this to satisfyfy my review requirements. Blah nlah blah blah bbn lah blah
good,"le lieu été agréable"
good,They try and keep things fun and safe for the work place. They put you in groups with fun badges with fun pics on them. It was a very fast paced area having to put a item in a bin under a minute.
good,"I didn't have too many coworkers. Most of my time was spent with one or two other people, including my supervisor and boss. I enjoyed my day to day duties and the warehouse made for an organized workspace."
good,"Great Opportunities to move up and learn new things. Opportunities to be cross trained and gain experience. The only downside is you stand for long periods of time and depending on your position, you may walk up to 10 miles a day."
good,"Fast pace work......."
good,"Sehr nettes unternehmen,!"
good,Super bonne organisation au niveau du travail et de l'ambiance.
good,"Started up the FC, largest in the nation; was challenging and dynamic. Was provided plenty of opportunity to learn about supply-chain logistics, 3PL's, and SAS's."
good,"culture, salaries, benefits, work-life balance, management, intense critic , Ability to make an impact on the companies growth. ..... Overall this is the best company I have ever worked for, this  not only shows passersby that the business has a fun vibe, at times it would be hard to meet rate “ due to the large amount of shipments that had to be out with also managing time properly to pick the next item to drop in our cage with several associates picking in the ale “ as well"
good,"nice environment for work, they give lot of workplaces to people. the work is a little tough and you can feel tired after some weeks but it's good for young people"
good,An upbeat workforce that made way into how you communicate with technical possibilities and productive encounters to make yourself a better lifestyle and a challenging way of cummunacating with customers which was actually very helpful
good,It was good working with the company. This is the good company for People seeking part time jobs. Great Benefits. Managers and co workers are very nice and cooperative.
good,"It was a wonderful experience working with Amazon.com. And very good work culture. They provided free food coupons,leaves,etc. Providing Security for ladies."
good,"The culture is fun. The work is easy if you have the customer service skills to make people happy so that they can rate you. work performance,  You need to get every two weeks a minimum of 80% otherwise you will be fired after 2 months."
good,"The best part of this job was the people. Most of the other warehouse workers were very personable, funny, and hard working. Some of the managers were condescending and supercilious, as were some of the ambassadors, but others were down to earth, competent, and a pleasure to work for. The ambassadors provided great training, as well. Easy work and great pay. I only left to pursue other options but I would happily return."
good,"Over night shift, small group great people to work with, everyone is willing to help each other out  to get the job done. Manger are ok depending on who’s working that night but don’t expect them to get up and help. With exception of one and she rocks! RL......"
good,I like working here because of the work culture and I feel like I'm important to the organisation. I have given opportunities to take part in deciding the correct resolution for a problem and I like the flexibility of the work that I do.
good,"Amazon velizy , l'entreprise grande comme plusieurs terrains de foot mais avec un accueil à taille humaine."
good,Very centric to singular duties however there is a good deal of opportunity to both move up as well as laterally withing individual distribution centers. Incredible training opportunities.
good,"Unorganized  and hot , a whole bunch of packages to handle and if not done at a certain time an extra hour is added onto shift  other than that amazon wasn’t very bad at all It was just too far away from where I lived"
good,Lots of benefits and the paid time off was great. The work schedule was good with 4 days of work and 3 days off. The pay is great and the job is easy.
good,Une bonne expérience mais trop temp de route pour moi c dommage
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. However,  unrealistic expectations must be achieved in an unrealistic time frame for an extremely Physical  position."
good,"Good - money, career progression, 100% customer focus"
good,"Starting off, you're given a lot of things and you can advance yourself professionally in pretty much any aspect you desire. Work is always fun on they daily, but can be stressful when its crunch time and everyone wants to finish for the day."
good,"It was a good stable job that paid well. As I worked there, I was able to meet some really cool people. The managers were nice and the work flow was productive."
good,"Good benefits, but pushes to hard and runs thru people like water. Other wise if you can deal its not bad . Hours are to long. They could go to a 8 hours shift and still get things done. Make is a 3 shift. They will have more people stay and get more done with out run the people into the ground. Not everyone is that happy at work."
good,"Productive job they’ll definitely have you working,things that can be improved are More flexibility hours for those that are attending school. Other than that it’s a pretty good job/ca"
good,"typical work day consisted of long periods on your feet with 3 stages of working areas there is pantry 78 degrees, fridge 36 degrees and freeze -10 to -20 degrees. You get 3 bracks 2 15 mins and a paid 30 mins"
good,"Had fun, co-workers and managers were cool. Great job if you learn multiple roles. Very boring if you only want to process all day, but still easy. 10 hour shifts are long but you only work 4 days."
good,"Very fun place to work, great break room, a chance to work with a diverse group of associates. they have fun ways to help keep there associates engaged. you get a chance to learn a lot of different type of jobs"
good,"Even as an intern, I was able to witness the speed at which Amazon is able to deliver new features. Customer obsession is very apparent, and there are many smart engineers working at Amazon."
good,It’s a fun place to work at for a start but the cost of living of where I stay plus the fees I had to pay for school is way higher than what I earn but the management is top notch
good,"Really competitive and fast pace, must have a drive to stand out and move forward. You can not just only be good at your job and mind your own business, you must seek opportunities constantly nothing is going to be given to you.  Pay sucks tho"
good,"The best part of amazon India is they have given us the opportunity to work from home , it helps to save travel time and many other expences. "
good,"Overall, the management and team leads were very good people. It was a new facility that had opened up in that area (Aurora CO). "
good,"I had an amazing experience at Amazon. The pay, environment, co-workers, everything was awesome and professional. However, with 10 hour days and taking public transit to and from work, I was putting in over 12 hours of my day for 4 days in a row. If you have your own car this would be easier for you. Also not a good choice for a first job. Everything else was a 10/10 though."
good,"spending a couple months working for amazon I had an overall great experience with the my coworkers.  on a typical day i was assigned tp a station where we assign routes to drivers across the country and you would often ask for help in the beginning because its alot to take in , everyone you share your work space with are pretty friendly and open to any questions you have about the job."
good,"They wanted quick and efficient working, which had incentives, like tablets, electronics, etc.they wanted fast effective work . They made the environment very competitive."
good,"The days at the amazon warehouse were pretty easy once you get into the hang of what you are doing. It was like once they train you are onward for success especially if you are quick , and efficient at work. This is definitely one of my favorite jobs to work at."
good,"Good summer job, and the pay is not bad especially if you are a college student. The environment can be slow or fast paced it depends on workload. Overall ok place to work."
good,"nice place to work, great poeple, great hours, great managers, and perks. would be very happy to refer anyone to work at Amazon. they also offer trade courses and college level classes to help people advance in life."
good,Amazon has a wonderful culture of growth and job potential. There are many advancement opportunities if approached correctly by an individual looking to move forward.
good,Amazon Fulfillment is a place where you have to be focused and ready to work for 10+ hours a day. Its not easy at first but once you get used to how the job operates it becomes easier.
good,"I have been working at Amazon  (less than a year)"
good,"Amazon is a very fast paced environment that likes to take new ideas and implement them as quickly as possible.  Love the day to day challenge.  Communication within leadership can be suspect, but overall I have really enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with Amazon. The benefits cannot be compared. However, management tended to be lackluster and uncaring. I always worked a minimum of 40 hours/week guaranteed and sometimes (especially around Prime Week and Cyber Monday) the contact volume was nearly unbearable (50+ hours/week mandatory overtime with constant back-to-back calls). Luckily Amazon compensates for this by providing paid time, unpaid time, and vacation time which you periodically get deposits of and accrue as you work. They allow you to take paid and unpaid time off as you need it, so you have the option of taking even just an extra 15 minute break to go take a breather. If you have the patience to sit behind a desk then you genuinely can't beat working for Amazon."
good,Overall good experience . I am working in amazon since from 2015.Everyday is treated as a first day at Amazon. Management is very good. Leave policy is fentastic
good,"Your work day consist of 40 hours a week"
good,The team I was a part of was much smaller than most teams in the fulfillment center. I was able to get on the job training. Amazon has awesome health benefits and you also get stock options.
good,"A day filled with new learning at every hour of the day. The team included many helpful hands when needed, who were ready to share their ideas to approach new things.Time management has been the key to a successful day."
good,"processing, diagnose, repair and fix customer returns and make them  happy and working in one of the biggest company is priceless. i am really proud to work here."
good,"I love the warehouse. I have worked several other warehouse jobs and this one is the best pay ,people , and have the best benefits if u dont like getting dirty and working out while you work this isn't what you want to be doing"
good,"The people were nice to work with and there is a big emphasis on safety. Don’t be afraid of heights, because you may have to work several feet off the ground and operate a PIT. It can be hard to balance keeping the rate and also being safe at the same time. They do give like 3 breaks though, so that nice. Overall it isn’t hard to get used to though over time."
good,"•	Promoted after 1 year to Training Associate, where I was previously employed as an internal auditor, performing basic audit functions, leading responsibility for US and UK region and training all new auditors."
good,Amazing bosses. They care. Hr is helpful. Night shift is killer but if you’re tough you can do it. I would recommend to anyone who isn’t a pansy. The pay is great.
good,"Great place to work, to learn new things. Good work culture and good environment. I enjoyed working with Amazon learnt many things which were useful for career prospective."
good,"You work 4 straight 10hr shift days then you get the other 3 days off. You have to work really hard when stowing, I was a stower, but the three days of rest is beneficial. The hardest part of stowing is finding room for the big boxes but overall it was pretty easy."
good,good place to work. it an environment of diversity. nice work ethics and very good support from other employees. training and career advancement opportunities are available as well.
good,Amazon is not a bad place to work its ok that's why I gave it a C. The pay is great and the fact that you get paid hours off and un paid time off on top of that vacations and some holidays off as well. But the one thing that makes Amazon a C is that Peak. Peak is around Novemeber and last till Januaery you work 5 days a week for 12 hours is so tiring.
good,"work hard have fun and make history"
good,"Mucho trabajo, tienen excelentes beneficios de salud"
good,"It's a fine place to work, you just have to be careful with your time management. I have seen many people get into trouble at work for going over break hours.  Always show show up on time!!"
good,The culture and people are very friendly and the management team works with you quite often. Everyone is willing to work with you. Advancement. Many opportunities pop up for associates to apply for. Entry level positions can work their way up to a tier 3 management positions in under a year.
good,Holidays are the best . When it's the busiest and you can get doubles everyday that's when you wanna work. Up to 60 hours a week swear it was the best i took every open shift i could
good,"j'ai beaucoup aimé y travailler."
good,"Leuke sphere, leuke collega's en een goed Management."
good,A typical day at Amazon included clocking in at 7:30 and making my way to the pick tower to then listen to my manager give me and my team a quick briefing before we start our day of hitting our targets. I learned that speed is not everything and to go for quality over quantity at times is better! The hardest part of the job was to remain focused and to scan our items accurately and to not miss any out. But i loved the people i worked with and that made my day at work a lot better!
good,"I was only part time at the fulfillment center in Durham, NC. Working at amazon was great for extra cash. Granted you are able to pick up more shifts, i wouldn't advise to use this as steady check to pay monthly bills."
good,the job isn't that hard it the same stuff everyday. come in here the announcement seeing how much packages we have .  then the worker separate and get to work.
good,I really enjoyed working for Amazon.  I worked from home. The training can be tough at times but if you stick with it and aren't shy you will prosper!
good,Just be careful if you really want this job. This job is not  gaurentee to have. They have Keep you or ask you to leave if you are not Keeping up to your hours of work
good,"Salle d'accueil agréable, boissons chaudes gratuites."
good,"While I was only there for a year, the culture is pretty relaxed for the most part.  The call center operates in two seasons, on season (thanksgiving/christmas) and off season (summer/early fall).  On season can get pretty hectic with ensuring the call center is ready for the holiday rush.  But, on the IT side of things, we are pretty busy all year round.  This particular call center featured a mini-mart, couches, PlayStation, big screen TV, popcorn machine, and some other goodies.  Hardest part of the job can be meeting the company's established metrics as a lot of people tend to game the system making it harder for the people who honestly resolve their tickets to meet those metrics.  Beyond that, it's one of the few jobs you can show up wearing your pajamas and not look out of place."
good,I enjoyed working here It was a great place to work but why do I have to fill out a review for this. I am really not interested. This is what happens w
good,"love love love this job! it is easy as pie, all you have to do is keep a pace a chill. there is noting to it and the people around feel the same way so that means new friends."
good,"Log into computer and take five minutes meeting time to open all programs that you will use and read any emails. After logging into system and getting into the work chat room and speaking, you go immediately into available in which you will take calls until your first fifteen minute break. Once you are done with your break, you come back on and continue to take calls until your hour lunch break. Once your break is up, you work an additional two hours and then you take your last break. On certain days, you will have a team meeting and if your team manager prefers, on other days, they will have a one on one with their employees. After the last two hours, you then clock out and log off for the day."
good,It was a fun environment everyone was very helpful when it came to getting tasks one. there were several times when i didn't understand things there but the management was very helpful
good,Amazon does not disriminate if you work hard and show up you will be rewarded it's fast paced so your day flies by and plenty hours if I could I am happy to go back indeed
good,"Process accounts and incoming payments in compliance with financial policies and procedures "
good,"at amazon its the same energy everyday. l learned how to be a work beast, however it does gives a person a whole 3 days off (we work 4 days per week) which i find to be real convenient."
good,"You will be working from the moment you clock in to the moment you clock out, work is rewarding and fast paced. Management is always accessible and easy to talk to. Job is physically demanding but accommodates all. (sort centers)"
good,"This was a great summer job for me, it is very fast paced but if you work hard you can get your work done efficiently and the pay is fair. This job is an easy job if you have the time to work 10-12 hours a day."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the company. I was given opportunities to prove my capabilities, being able to work collaboratively with those from my own site as well as with those around the world. Growth opportunities were endless if you were willing to relocate. I learned a lot about what I was capable of, a lot of leadership and management, but the demanding schedule of peak season is difficult to manage for most. I loved the fast paced environment but it's not for everyone."
good,Managers are tough but as long as your keeping up with rate they are good...fast paced environment and have to be willing to work long hours. When able to they give a lot of voluntary time off which is good if you know how to balance your time and always have a secure job
good,Productive work. Management is great. Not too stressful and great teamwork. You learn how to deal with customers in a professional & friendly manner..
good,"I feel like amazon is a good company to work at they provide so many resources for their employees and they want their employees to succeed . The have tuition reimbursement options for those who want to go to school , they have classrooms at some facilities"
good,"A LOT Of WALKING. Like a ton of walking, 12 hours a day. This was a great job with great benefits for those that can do the walking, I have nerve damage in my foot so I couldn't keep doing it."
good,"I loved working there... would not have left the job if it wasn't for my higher studies."
good,a typical day would be getting a free hot drink in the canteen and relax for 5 mins. then i would go to work packing for about 4 hours have a 30 min break and the cycle repeats once more. the hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time but i got used to it after a while. the most enjoyable part was the people i met there were enjoyable to talk to.
good,Amazon will help you grow both professionally and personally. They are committed to their customers and associates who want to develop their own growth.
good,Its goord to work in amazon as a fresher. I would like to upgrade my skills and willing to settle down in my home town Delhi. I am lookings for something good in delhi/NCR/NOida or gurgaon for japanese opportunity.
good,other than internal politics its a wonderful place to be a part of.
good,"Despite the Brand Ambassador position being a part-time position, I thoroughly enjoyed working at Amazon.com, Inc with Fuse Marketing. As a Brand Ambassador, I worked with a partner in the designing, planning and execution of events in order to spread brand awareness and increase Prime Student membership sign ups."
good,Opportunity for advancement if you work hard.  Part time benefits are modest.  You receive 20 unpaid hours off per quarter.  The work can be monotonous but the culture is positive.  Management provides good leadership and will mentor those who show promise.
good,Day starts at 8 am where Team lead allocates work for each individual. Allocated work should be completed at end of the day. Better work life balance and fun at workplace
good,"Fast paced and good place to work, looking to advance to a management position excellent security staff to keep us safe. I want a job that can give me a living."
good,"Bonne gestion de l'entreprise."
good,"One of my favorite jobs, because i love driving and time goes by really quickly. i enjoyed the extra exercise i would get daily when loading packages and delivering to homes. A typical day at work would be first having a meeting about what goals to accomplish that day and how to reach the goal, line up collect your packages, scan them, and load them up and off you go. Everyone was really nice and helpful, whenever i would finish my route early i would help out my team. The hardest part of the job would have been the rainy days when we would have to deliver in pouring rain. i loved all the overtime and extra days i would get."
good,"Lots of benefits, so it is worth the slave labor. I was a picker, but I did not mind it because they rewarded me for my hard work. You do have to put in the work though, because you are constantly being monitored, which kind of made me uncomfortable."
good,In the full year I worked there I didn't hear a single person raise their voice to another which is very pleasant. The machinery is of top quality and maintenance budget was always an afterthought which gave the mechanics free reign to fix as they needed to.
good,I worked in the afe packing department of Amazon and enjoyed my work for the most part. I had the opportunity to get to know my coworkers and socialize on the job as long as productivity was kept up. Work had to be done at a VERY fast pace and if you didn't meet requirements you could be terminated. Luckily the managers are fairly lenient but expect constant and quality work.
good,"I go to work with an positive attitude, given daily task i make sure to finish my work load by the end of my shift. My work place is an friendly working environment , we all help one another. Team work comes in clutch. I have learned to work in large amounts of group. Time management, working with groups of 3 or more can be tough, its always best to be at the same pace. The tough part of this job is when i end up doing scanning most of my time, as it can get really stressful and boring at times. The part i enjoy is working as an team because  it gives me experience to know about one another."
good,Your work is recognized by the management and its a fun place to be. You have a lot of growth opportunities and there is no biasing system. Flat hierary
good,i would like to stay with the company but i am trying to relocate to houston texass to be with my girlfriend.  So right now there is no transfers available for me so this is why im trying to find a different path for my future
good,"Great place to work. Fun and productive enviornment with open door policies. No uniform is required, dress code is casual. Safety is closely monitored."
good,"Amazon is a great place to start your career. One would love working here. The salary and perks are really good. All you have to do is be customer obsessed!"
good,"The more people you know, the easier it is. Production rate can be a scary thing and it takes a while to get the hang of it. If you work hard and get along with people well, you will make it far. Don't kill yourself in the process it's just a job after all."
good,"Fun, easy, and a good job to have when you have other plans, or work a second job. Friendly coworkers, and easy to get along with managers. It's quick paced, but it's also easy to get bored. In my case, I usually sing in my head and sometimes dance around while I work. There's a lot of space, so I don't bump into people. If you plan on working here, just be sure to have fun with it. It's a good place to work."
good,"Mi piaceva tutto ."
good,"No day is the same.  Every day is day 1. "
good,You get plenty of time off with roll over vacation and paid time off. Plus voluntary time off when they dont have enough work. You get stock for free after working two years which is a added bonus.
good,"Amazon is a faster work place as the deal with customers order and they always find the ways to remain on the top in the market place. so, our daily work was normal and fast with good management, the task was mostly based on device connectivity, troubleshooting and installation. as all electronic device, sometime we don't just understand why they stop working so the job was including patient and self control."
good,"Very nice people within the job, good benefits, nice work environment even within the digital realm. Also working from home with no commute is a big benefit."
good,Very friendly work place. Easy job compared with Curtis. Great benefits and stock after your there 2 years. The only draw back is all schedules include working Sundays. I do not want to work Sundays. The pay is a little low but sometimes benefits make up that.
good,"I have been working with Evi Technologies since last 1 year and it was a wonderful experience throughout."
good,Une première expérience des plus riche dans des conditions optimales! Bâtiment chauffé et manager présent. Travaille dur mais pas plus que d'autres. Au final le confort de travail le rend bien plus facile.
good,Its a fast paced job.great benifits and stock options. You will definatly earn your pay check working here. Its a fun place to work. Peak seasons are rough but it pays off in the end.
good,Good place to advance in work. I learned how to be quick and get things done in a certain time. The warehouse was big full of people I learned something everyday such as policy procedures.
good,"I love working with my team at Amazon, even though we worked very hard, and at a very fast pace, we tried everyday to best of our ablity to reach our goal for the day or even the week. However, what I loved most was that we had a really good environment, and that we enjoyed each other no matter what the circumstance was or the obstacle we faced."
good,Great place to work with amazing management which truly care for their employees. I would highly recommend Amazon to anyone who is willing to work for an innovative company.
good,"A typical work day was fairly quick-paced and ""full"", demanding but not strict."
good,"I was in a sorting facility and the biggest problem was the work was repetitive and if it was slow the shift dragged. The best part about Amazon is the people you work with and the fact you work pretty independently. Peak season can be a pain but you are busier so the time passes quicker. You do have to stand or walk a lot but I didn't find that to be a problem. The time off is nice. They give you a set amount of hours to be off per quarter, and they do roll over. They also have voluntary time off that happens on a very regular basis, depending on the season it can be every day. No job is hard to do, which can sometimes make it difficult when people slack. They pay you very well for what you're there to do. One annoying thing is they can move you to another job in the warehouse if they need people. So you may not always be doing what you want, but I never thought it was that big of a deal. My experience with management was pretty good, I liked most of my managers and those I didn't care for much were easy to avoid. Pretty much as long as you do your job and aren't late from breaks you get left alone."
good,"great management, fast paced environment, good hours, people are friendly and helpful, I like the part time hours it gives flexibility in my schedule, and good lunch and snacks."
good,Amazon is a pretty good place to work at. They have excellent pay and great benefits. I wouldn't recommend working here if you have kids. They aren't very flexible when you are a parent.
good,"The staff are very assertive and understanding. It is a great place to work. Although, it's not the kind of job you would want to have if you have an outside life. Basically, if you have children, and motherly/fatherly duties, it is not the job for you. The hours are very long and the job requires you to be full-time. The atmosphere is great though."
good,"A typical workaday at Amazon, jump into work, morning meetings, working sessions, lunch, training for new conventions, back to work until end of day. Team work environment, but must be a independently motivated."
good,Amazon is a place were your moving constantly all day .In the workplace everyone is friendly and always provide help as needed. In amazon your attended to pick customers items as given on the scanner and sending them off .
good,"You can expect to "" roll up your sleeves"" but the environment is nourishing with lots of tools to succeed. My managers, some are young, will get in there with you when deadlines are close too. The physical part can be a lot at time so stretch daily and eat breakfast. You can't beat the paid time!"
good,"You have to meet your targets daily or you will be warned. Amazon salary is pretty good."
good,"Working at Amazon:"
good,"Great place to work. 2 breaks of 30 minutes, on feet almost all time. Basically as long as you did your job right, no problems. Good rewards such as being able to use many ways to secure hours. Unpaid time off that adds little by little, vacation time off as well, voluntary time off, and team competitions. Winner had bbq. Some people complain but i feel its an easy job for the pay."
good,It was a great place to work at when you needed extra money for the week. I was only an temp but it still was a great place to work at. You meet new people as well.
good,Amazon has great training procedures. Everybody knows their job role and works hard to achieve their best. Daily department meetings keeps you updated about new achievements and events.
good,"The only thing I can say is if you've never worked in a warehouse, just because you hear the name Amazon do not assume it's any different. Warehouse work is long and hard and you do walk a lot, so expect just that. You have the option to do different base level positions which is nice. You meet some great people and many of the managers and senior ops are great quality people. There is definitely a lot of positions within the company that are available to employees."
good,"Not like any warehouse that I have worked in previously. Automation has made this warehouse cutting edge, but the demand of the workers is very intense."
good,"10 h shifts you get to choose days or nights... really good salary for night operatives and you get rewarded for good work or  are looking at receiving a full time offer from Amazon directly."
good,"Great job, questionable management in some areas( especially during Q4). Friendly atmosphere. Multiple options for how to spend breaks, lunch room, quiet room with books, or the game room with pool tables, ping pong, fooseball and tv."
good,A typical day at amazon was fast-paced but enjoyable. You have to be on your feet at all times. I've learned since working here that you have to be very cautious while packaging.
good,"Great place to work. steady hours , good benefits, not a bad place overall. Just think for the work they should pay more on the hour. And give better opportunity for advancement in the Buisness."
good,"It is a great work environment, fast paced, good people, and an awesome management team. The hardest part about working here would be the 15 minute breaks, because our facility is so big we cut our breaks into half walking to the break room. Though, I do enjoy the gifts and drawings they offer."
good,"Work includes heavy lifting sometimes and you are always moving (which, I think, just benefits you), hours go by very fast and it is never boring as you get assigned to do different tasks. Time management and willingness to do your best is a must! Nice people to work with and the management is great."
good,"There is a lot of hardwork put into the workplace at amazon, there is not much in terms of social interactment, mainly just getting your head down and getting on with your work but overall a good place to work."
good,"I was hired during peak, which means you'll have to work at least 5 days a week, 11 hours a day. The job itself is very simple. You'll be doing one task either standing or walking for your entire shift. Breaks are really short since you have to compensate for the amount of time it takes to reach the break room since the facility is so large."
good,A daily exercise prior to start of work which is good for conditioning the body. Scanner is provided for every worker and give us a chance to learn in using it. The workplace is clean and enable us to do our work efficiently. The work is ok except for the fact that we are unsure if we will be continuously working for the company so that we will continuously earn money for our daily needs.
good,"Fun filled workplace! Managers are very versatile to many personalities. Very high paced work environment, I learned to keep moving and to always check your screen on your handgun. I really enjoy having my lunch break!"
good,Amazing job if you need a temporary job during the holidays. Really diverse group of people and all in all a great experience. Would do it again next season.
good,Definetly a great place to work. I would recomend it to anyone. The job can be fast pace and can get a little difficult at times. The managers are helpful and will listen to you.
good,"Nice place to work....if they offered full time, I would work there for sure! Health benefits for full time employees would be nice. The ability to work at any fulfillment center around the country is Awesome especially if you need to relocate for a Full time job"
good,"Average day at Amazon was long, but enjoyable. The pay, medical, dental, and vision healthcare was cheap but thorough. Their Peak Season, however, was crazy."
good,"On a normal day we would check in at the beginning of shift and all crew team members would meet up for briefings and stretches. Afterwards we would immediately got to our assigned stations and begin working, with various breaks including lunches required. Management was motivated and intent on attaining the best numbers for their teams, but that mean they always checked in on you if any problems were detected. Although fast paced, amazon provides various opportunities for advancement and they provide a plethora of benefits for employees."
good,"While I hadn't been employed at Amazon for long, I did enjoy working alongside my co-works and my supervisors. The work-load wasn't that much on a day to day basis, but as with most warehouses you're working on a concrete floor which does mean your feet will hurt after a while. You're constantly on the move though."
good,"Friendly people and steady rate of work for 4 to 5 hours a day. Parking can be chaotic. Overall you will get along with everyone there and you have a quota to meet, just like every job."
good,"If you aren't prepared to work hard, dont go to Amazon.  There are endless opportunities for someone who is willing to start from the bottom and work their way up, or for someone who already has a degree.  My management here was wonderful and always made sure that we had a good time while getting our jobs done.  Peak can really break you becuase of the mandatory overtime, but you have so much extra money that you don't have time to complain about it!"
good,Loved the environment.Managers play vital role.Fun to work in the company .Amazing culture.Exerience counts.Colleagues are amazing.Payrolls are pretty good.
good,It's a good job for college student's because of the flexible schedules but it can be stressful and I can't see myself there for the rest of my life but everyone's different.
good,"Most workable place with lots of freedom and there is a lot of scope for growth."
good,Fast Pace and productive. Been with the company for about 4 years. Great benefits. HR is very cooperative as well. Great pay as well as bonuses for productivity.
good,"A typical day at the job would be very competitive. The production is great for to someone use to working this job, but working here you need to put the best effect into keeping this job. Good pay. You learn that its a big work place environment and to always stay safe while working. The building could feel just as it could feel outside, so it always great to dress according to the weather. The hardest part of having this job is making production and making sure you're there on time everyday and the stay consistent. The most enjoyable ting about this job is during peak season they give away plenty of gifts."
good,It is a perfect place to work but just got bored with the same old stuff. Learnt a lot of things at Amazon which helps us in building ourselves into a better person. I had the opportunity to work and help a new site set up and it has been a great experience so far. But there comes a point where you need to change and explore new situations.
good,Worked very hard in a fast paced environment but nevertheless was appropriately compensated with salary and benefits.  Would return immediately if AMZN would allow me.
good,"The job gives you a goal and a way to get to the goal, the rest is up to you. There are coaches and advisors  to give tips along the way as well. Everyone is given plenty of help and there are lots of ways for workers to achieve their rate and meet standards at their own pace."
good,I enjoy being there.  The management is excellent.  I can honestly say that I've really enjoyed working there because of my Area Managers.  Just fantastic people
good,"Amazon is an excellent place to work but be ready to work hard and do many of the same tasks over and over for weeks at a time. Expect to stand, walk, lift, crouch, climb stairs, and pivot for the entire 10 hours you are in the facility. There are opportunities for advancement but it is a very competitive environment so the opportunities are sometimes few and far between. If you have a Bachelors Degree I would highly recommend working here since you can apply directly into a Leadership position and once you reach that level advancing is much easier."
good,I would recommend this job to a friend. It's a good place to work. They have their perks. It's easy and sometimes competitive but all in all its a good place to work.
good,"Shifts are 12 hours, however, you get two 30 minute and a 15-minute break, 3 hours apart. Management one on one reflects or coaches you if necessary to help better your role as an associate. You are required to stay hydrated. Amazon offers many benefits including health coverage, 401k, and tuition assistance. Pay rate depends on your shift. No matter what, you get a raise of 25 cents every six months. (Etna Ohio location)"
good,They need to make the lazy and slow workers work harder or at least give more incentive to work harder. The hard workers always have to cover for all the lazy people.
good,"I really enjoy working for Amazon because of the flexibility and the pay. Typical day would be to go to the warehouse, receive your packages and then deliver them to homes. Pretty fast paced and easy. Management is very fun and laid back to work with. "
good,"It is a really fast pace job. Reduced time schedule are 12 hours every Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 6PM-6:30AM. It can be hard but not impossible. It gives A LOT of overtime and the pay is good. Prepare to work hard."
good,"This was a very hardworking fast pace job. Sometimes the long hours can weigh on you in a negative way. When I first started, more than half of the people in my orientation group quit within the first week of employment."
good,"It was a stress free working environment, It was fun working at Amazon. The incentives were great. Good Work was rewarded. There were 24 hours rotational shifts."
good,"A typical day at work would include learning, engaging in day to day work, not to forget to enjoy work, enjoying work makes it fun and fun helps in having better outcomes."
good,"learned that it takes a athletic or strong person to work there , its a great experience to work there , you see all kinds of shipment that comes in there and all . Great co-workers from all over , great CEO, nice environment"
good,"Amazon is a good place because of the social environment you can have with your coworkers. Great competition games that we are able to compete for and win prizes, such as gift cards and electronics."
good,its a fisical job just have to be in shape but its very nice people are very nice and helping you learn alot because of the different area you get to work in.
good,"Again, this is not kosher.  I have never had to rate past employers.  A good way to get bad recomendations.  Not happy about this feature of indeed AT ALL."
good,A typical day at Amazon as a seasonal employee during peak season was tiring but well-worth the pay. I learned how to Stow while I was there and the pick system. Working with a safety minded attitude. I learned how to lift properly. I learned how work graveyard shift. Their management there were insightful with questions and help. The Workplace culture was friendly but competitive at the same time. Staying on your feet is the hardest part of job and staying awake. The most enjoyable part of the was being able to fend for myself and that sweet paycheck.
good,Amazon culture is excellent. my first MNC job experience is in amazon. Always given first propriety to customers. so that presently amazon is a great MNC in the world.
good,A day to day challenging part of work with which we can learn new things by disagree and commit... We learned a lot of things on a daily basis because of the pilot process with efficient leaders for us to guide on. The workplace culture in amazon is the best
good,You are rewarded for your performance and nothing more. It is a great culture (a few bad apples) and there is tons of growth opportunity due to the sheer size of the company.
good,"Environnement de travail agréable "
good,"fast pace, great people. lots of benefits and opportunities."
good,"As the above motto suggests, Amazon is a fun place to work in, provided you work hard. It is an energetic place to work in as most of the employees are in the age groups of 25-35. There is free flow of ideas and managers are always looking forward to encourage their team members to perform well and provide them with a promotion."
good,Every day is going to be new. Ambiguity is going to be your friend. So much to learn and so many resources. No limits to what you can learn. You grow as per the thirst you have.
good,"my typical work day starts out fast paced then slows down some. I've learned a lot on how to operate different machines such as forklifts, reach trucks, and doublewalkies"
good,"For a warehouse job I would say that it's a really nice place to work for while getting the needed benefits and interaction required to live. They pay really well for the amount of time you are spending there, but the time off you get per week isn't as kind if you are trying to have a life outside of work."
good,"everyday challenges are different, as the culture of the company is different,."
good,"nice work culture"
good,"Transparent culture, empathetic people and a handful of work. That was my experience at Amazon."
good,"Productive ,"
good,"had a great time working here, very fast friendly environment, many  employees, had opportunity to learn many job functions there. I also made many friends within this company. great benefits"
good,"- day shift"
good,"Job had great benefits, long hours, hard on your feet, mandatory overtime during peak hours from November to January. Mandatory overtime when needed, sometimes sporadically."
good,Amazon is a wonderful place to work and growth is immense even if you give a little honest efforts. There is a lot of flexibility and culture is also on the informal side. Hard work is recognised and rewarded.
good,Fast-paced especially around the holidays. Managers don't micromanage and you are free to work at your own pace. Only met superior one time during orientation.
good,"Seasonally, a good job to make quick money for the holidays. Busy during the holidays but a job that requires you to be very active. Great to get the exercise but not a very fun job as there was no music playing and we could not listen to any music either based on location of factory."
good,"Experience working for the largest ecommerce retailer, Amazon. I gained insight into a 24-hour operational company and learned how to work effectively under high pressure."
good,"Very good company to work with. Very good wok environment and incentives.Low salary in some profile.More work is there for associate level employees sodexo,transport free"
good,"Was a nice place love the pay and benefits they gave us and the hours were crazy but what they pay us it was worth it and they give us 10 mins break , 10 mins break , and then they give us another 30 mins break"
good,travail dans de bonnes conditions suivi par les managers
good,Grupo everyone help precaution experienced with the people who worked experience to company and help the group safety every times the people is very good together
good,It is very fast pace and you have to learn to keep up and meet the quota every 2 hours whic is 100% . other then that you learn to enjoy your job and other people who work wit you
good,This job is fast paced and there is a slight leaning curve but it's definitely hands on and Amazon will give you the experience you desire. It's great for entry-level employees to get experience
good,Fast pace job but you get used to it after a while. Very talented people. Working at Amazon brought out the best in me. Good training is provided for those who are interested.
good,"Etre très rapide, bon ambiance même si cela n'est pas facile"
good,"first two weeks spent in training then given your assignments. Learned how to scan items "
good,"Excelente empresa para trabalhar, tem uma enorme preocupação com o cliente, o que gera satisfação em saber que a empresa realmente não se importa apenas com números, mas também com a prestação do seu serviço."
good,"Working at an Amazon warehouse is ""easy"". You have an assigned role, you do your assigned role, meet quota/rate without dawdling too much, and you're good to go. As a picker, we work in clusters, which are separate parts of the building. On a good day, you'll move regularly without being stuck in one area for too long. Being stuck in a part of the building for a long time can be a good/bad thing depending on what you're picking. Clothing/apparel are easy and help your daily quota. Some mods are good for easy picking where others have you climbing up stairs and walking long distances. Management is reliable for the most part. They try their best to keep employees engaged albeit it can get repetitive at times. The people there are very friendly, and they help out new people. It's easy to make friends, but sometimes they distract you from work. The hardest parts of the job are being awake for ten hours (including the hours going to/coming from work), meeting quotas, and trying not to be bored. The lunch break is only 30 minutes, which means you'll have to scarf down your food. Bring plenty of snacks to keep yourself satiated during the day. The most enjoyable parts of the job are VTO (voluntary time off) which allows you to leave work early if there isn't enough work/too many people working in one department. After working for a year, Amazon offers Career Choice program which provides tuition at various colleges.  After two years, you get Amazon's stock. Working four days and having off three days for full time, part time usually works weekends and reduced time for students. Weekend"
good,"Sleep good."
good,Le poste de préparateur de commande est poste assez physique mais simple. Il ya un réel suivi établi par les managers dans le sens ou ils sont disponibles pour nous. ils échangent avec les employés afin de leurs faire progresser et c'est un point assez important.
good,the journey in amazon till now has been good. The work culture is fun and productive. People are cooperative and friendly including managers. the working hours are too much in amazon which makes it difficult for our health.
good,"Was a nice work , a good team and a good experience ! I hope someday to return at this warehouse! I apply again for this job and I'm waiting for a response!"
good,Amazon is the best place to park at four season it is very hard but it's very healthy for a lot of people we have one 30 minute break then twi 15 minute breaks but the brakes go by so fast as they were literally standing on her feet all day we have paid vacations and family fun
good,Prouductive and fun . Very nice place to work . They are always giving opportunities for associates to move up . They also have great benefits and they have one of the biggest parking lots in Baltimore
good,"Standing on your feet in one place for 10 hours a day gets annoying after awhile BUT Amazon does offer wonderful benefits, multiple time off options and a diverse environment."
good,Workplace culture getting to know new people. Face paced. The hardest part of the job is keeping up rate. Management seems to get along with mostly everyone
good,They train u in what ever u show interest in. They r friendly and an outgoing place to work. They work with you when u need time off. they r strick about u being on time but if you have to be late and call ur fine.
good,Amazon offers fast growth to all employers. Amazon builds leadership skills. A typical day at work would include strict time structure and achievable goals in your respective department.
good,"Amazon gives you a lot of freedom to work and develop your own ideas. The management is very supportive, work can be a little more specially during the sale days. Growth prospects are slower as compared and salary benefits are less, but if you get good shops that gets compensated"
good,"getting various amounts of customers everyday, learned how to better my communication skills, very knowledgeable management that can help solve your problems, the worst part was the tough customers and the best part would be helping solve the customers problems"
good,"I love working at amazon. Mia5 was and still is one of my favorite job ever. We had benefits and they gave us options on getting more hours and to do ot."
good,Ok job if you live close. Was traveling 40 minutes and paying tolls so I quit because I was not feeling like I was benefiting by doing all of that and also it was too many physical demands. I was sore every day. Could barely make dinner when I came home. But if you have a lot of energy and you are motivated it's definitely a great opportunity
good,this job is not meant for someone who enjoys being sociable with their co workers. most of your time on the job is spent alone or very few interactions with your colleagues. you will spend 9  of your 10 hrs working alone i most cases. as far as the job its self it is rather easy but hard on the body and requires a well balanced diet and and a full nights rest. The benefits start from day one and there is always room for overtime. amazon itself was a great place to work but the fullfillment center is just a little tough
good,"It's a great place to work, but they have less breaks when we work 11 hours. Lunch break is ok. It's a fast paced working environment with the ability to work fast to make rate in order to meet customers' demand."
good,"It is a tidy place to work, it is a little bit stressfull as another places. The people is ok, it is nice that you have transport and free drinks. And the shift is ok."
good,"Loved the environment, the team, the team lead and support staff. I was hired as a seasonal employer during the influx of online Christmas shoppers . When the season was o over I was l laid off."
good,"Amazon was a very good job to have. Everyone was friendly there, things are in order and its very quiet there very peaceful to work in. Although you do have to be one dedicated person to work there because the hours are crazy there but it all pays off because of the check you worked so hard for."
good,fun to work i like this job i m excited to work . i worked in amazon warehouse like more than 1 year . i like that job.so i  m ready to work to amazon
good,"Work at Amazon is both challenging and Fun (the fun in winning a challenge)."
good,This is a good job but in the end you don't have time for anything else because you're too tired to even think about other things. Everything is pretty easy and the management is nice and understanding for the most part.
good,This is a great job with great pay but it's takes a lot of work hours I worked some days for 12 hours and I have a family and I really wasn't able to spend much time with them but if you are a free agent this will be a perfect job
good,"Lab126 is a relatively small company, but maintains strict standards in product design. Hence its a great place to learn. The open culture also promotes access to information and resources to improve one's career - both technically and leadership qualities."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for for boys and girls of all ages.  the work is fairly easy and well organized. They offer great benefits and opportunities for all employees.  The culture around the warehouse is pretty friendly and helpful. Pretty well managed workflow in all departments.  The biggest challenge was always meeting customer expectations when even having to overcome the biggest barriers, but well worth the feeling of accomplishment over a hard challenge."
good,fast paced work environment. great break room accommodations. time off is easily manageable. great stock options and lots of investment opportunities.
good,"Most the managers who work here are very friendly and easily approachable. All the people are great.Most days you joke around with you friends in between phone calls. "
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for. The benefits are great. The 10 hour works days, 4 days a week allow for 3 days off providing the employee with a great work life balance. Workplace culture is very different from other companies but not in a bad way. They have their own way of doing things that is difficult to explain. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 10 hours a day, sometimes a bit more. Sometimes the facility or certain shifts work mandatory overtime, they also provide options such as voluntary overtime or extra time. It is overall one of the best companies to work for. Many other facilities do not provide air conditioning to the employees but all amazons do. Some facilities even provide water bottles to their employees during harsh summers. Amazon hires many young graduates to be managers which is great opportunities for them however some (not all) could use some classes on people skills and experience with working the floor."
good,"it is an easy job. long hours and gets pretty repetitive but makes decent money for what is required so as long as you don't hate it, its worth the money with good benefits."
good,"Amazon is a fun workplace where you get to meet all kinds of people."
good,"As a part time employee we do get paid for 6  holidays each year.  We do also, received 20 hours every quarter of Unpaid Time Off which helps when you are sick.  You can carry over up to 80 hours of UPT.  There are some nights where you work 5 hours and there are some nights where we only work 3 hours depending on the volume.  Amazon does guarantee 18 hours minimum pay when you work the full 5 days and you don't take any Volunteer Time Off or call out sick."
good,"Honestly I love working here and would only leave if the pay fits. I love the culture, the paid time off, and the location even. It does pay more than the usual call center ($8 an hour is for imbeciles)"
good,It was tiring but the work was fairly easy once you got trained in your position. It became second nature to me. I enjoyed the time I was there and the other employees.
good,Everyone is so helpful and they all want to see you grow with the company. Granted their is some bad seeds but that do not over do the great seeds their.
good,"It took a while for me to actually start work. I applied mid April and received an email a week later. We had the orientation a few weeks after and took the drug test. 4 weeks later was the hiring event, which was paid, and started our actual schedule right after."
good,"Good pay and benefits. Community was very close knit, knew a lot of people by the time I quit. Managers were very understanding and helped out whenever there were problems. Work ranged from very easy to moving heavy boxes depending on the days needs. Lots of walking/standing up is required for almost the entire day."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work at with good benefits and a great team. However, you really have to push yourself if you want to succeed because it's a tough job."
good,Learned a lot gained a lot of experience in problem solving and met a lot of fun caring people there. The managers and PA's where very kind and helpful.
good,You can chose to work a challenging and rewarding job task or take it a little easier and work at a slower pace scanning pacakges. Either way its an upbeat place to work.
good,Starting your career at Amazon is like a dream for any fresher. You are able to get into a nice corporate culture with a vast atmosphere and there is always scope to learn something new everyday. The flexible working hours and the amount of freedom we are given apart from worktime makes it a top notch company to strive at. Your views are always addressed and taken for consideration and there is no bias for action. Working at Amazon has been a wonderful start right from Day 1.
good,The management was exceptional and understanding. work was grueling and fast paced. the motto was to have fun and very customer focused. competition was encouraged.
good,Fun to work at such a place. You get 2 week offs. After office no one disturbs. Option to work from home. Main mantra is that the work should be done on time. N matters if u do it from home or at office.
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon, it was a very interesting experience for me. Im certified to drive the cherry picker for my specific job description in my department."
good,Great company to work for if have older or no kids. There's a lot of long days at least 14-15 hours shifts. Overtime pay is great and the never mess up with your check. They value their employees.
good,"You always got to work hard and get the job done. Trying to be as quick as you can, and you can always have fun doing it. Lots of walking or no walking at all, depends on the job you are doing."
good,Great place to learn... A new experience in life and a person learns how to handle situations.. good transportation facility was given but it would be late at times...
good,"Overall great experience. Very fast paced working, allows to learn how to drive forklift. Many opportunities throughout the entire warehouse. Downfall is because it's part time, we don't get the full benefits."
good,"clock in with key card and then head over to our team meeting,jump into our forklifts and go to work. everyone is nice including management.the most enjoyable time at work is meeting new people and new friends."
good,i like my job at amazon was in the best depatrment was difficult and targets where managable. pmp where a great agency always gave me information and got to do extra courses would defenitly go back
good,"Typical day on they job. Arrive to work get the days work details, stretch and got to your work station and get to work. I learned to operate an order picker. good management,"
good,Excelente Empresa que acrescentou muito conhecimento e profissionalismo a minha vida pessoal.
good,Great place to work can get hectic at times as all jobs but they treat you with respect. Not too hard on you. The company tries to work with everyones schedule to put you on the sort that you request.
good,It is a great place to work @ amazon.Management is very good infact processes makes management stronger. Best company to work with just need to work upon salary benefits to employees.
good,"job is good not increment in salary good come back on routes and we know about public and i got a two RNR AWARD IN AMZON.IN"
good,"Amazon is an amazing place to work. Depending on how much you commit to being an Amazonian you will receive just as many perks benefits and pay. Work hard, exceed the standard."
good,I was always on time to work and work always went by fast. I was always being productive which made my days at work go by fast. I enjoyed working with people who always taught me how to do my job right.
good,"it doesnt take too long to get the hang of things, its almost right away. same things for different days. I do believe you are able to rotate stations depending on if its full or not or where you make it to. The hardest part of the job is the long hours of standing and short breaks. At the end of the week the checks are lovely and most of the people are friendly."
good,"Package handles is not  a very challenging job, but it pays well and its very convenient as it only requires 4 hours a days for 5 days a week. I would definitely recommended for people going to school. Also be sure to take advantage of the benefits."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for. They always keep you busy with a lot of work, value each one of their employees and have a great job culture. Although being a test technician can get quite boring because its very repetitive work, the people that I work with make the experience better."
good,"The managers, supervisors and employees are all very nice. It's a great environment to work and be in. Really the only issues are the hours. I started working there shortly before their ""busy season"" that put us on flex time and supposedly would allow us to get plenty of hours yet we were still working 3-5 hours a day and there wasn't enough VET (voluntary extra time) to go around and it was often for undesirable shifts. (7-11pm, midnight-4am etc.). Also the job can get very repetitive as it's very, very simple."
good,"Due to being a temporary worker as well as it being a busy season due to Christmas, I had to ride a shuttle in and out of work. On the job it was very fast paced and a little demanding with them wanting us to send out 230+ items an hour. My first real day working I was told I averaged at around 150."
good,"You go to work and at stand up while you are stretching your told the goal for the day and then you start working. You only have three breaks which are two fifth teen minute breaks and a lunch break. After lunch you do everything over again. I enjoyed doing ICQA because its easy, all you do is sit down, count and record it"
good,The hours are very convenient and the pay is good at $14 an hour. I wish I could get more hours but the hours I do get are the same week to week which is nice.
good,"Simply awesome. The best place to work with.S"
good,Actually Amazon was one of the leading company..... So I wish to work here and fun work also..... I Completed my b.Tech at sahaja engineering college at karimnagar
good,"Very tough job but overall rewarding. Long hours though, especially durring the peak season. Good pay regardless. Lots of walking. Very hard on the feet."
good,"A typical day at Amazon for me would start at 7:30 am. I am on my feet all day. The work is constantly , non stop. At times the production levels can be over whelming. Thats when the help from management is needed, but thats you won't see happen. A manager getting their hands dirty. The hardest part of being an Amazon employee, is the 15 min. break , scan to scan. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job would be the pay."
good,They give you a lot of freedom but also expect you to do the good quality of work.A typical day at work would be very hectic. sometimes I would take over 100 calls a day which is very stressful. But they give you good pay at the end of day which is best part
good,The break rooms in any of them were perfect. The food in the freezers where always fresh and the t.vs where awesome as well. I always had a fun time playing in the table tenis things. Also everyone are so nice and accepting while working there. Great place to work. I recommend it anyone.
good,"Start from meeting with leaders and managment."
good,I had interned with Amazon and i think they one of the best work culture . The management is quite open to new ideas . Great rewards for best performer .
good,Love my job and my team. Amazon has a very unique and special culture. Managements are awesome. There're a lot of opportunities to grow within the company which is very nice to have.
good,The hardest part of the job was just being on your feet all day. The work was simple and also efficient. Management was good and always made sure the staff was comfortable and safe
good,"Was there a wk where I was 'slamming' packing. I couldn't keep up  & back, knees killing me. Went to the mngrs, they put me on picking.  Which I like."
good,"Si usted hace su trabajo bien, nadie se preocupa por que este haciendo de más, no hay codigo de vestimenta y hay mucha flexibilidad de horarios"
good,Dort zu arbeiten war schon eine gute erfahrung die ich gemacht habe doch wurde es sehr schnell monoton und unötig stressig. Ich habe mich gefühlt als ob ich meine Seele am Eingang abgebe und wieder mit nehme. Gehaltsmässig war es aber sehr in Ordnung.
good,If you enjoy hard work and making money..I Love working for Amazon and yeah we get frustrated but what job doesn't..work is steady and leaders are nice and helpful. MDW6 is def a work in progress but changing and growing rapidly. Amazing coworkers too😊 Feels like family❤
good,"Great place too work, Friendly people and a great environment too be in. Keeping busy is no problem in Amazon with the amount of orders we get daily.."
good,"responsibilities: loading the van, delivering parcels along a particular route using Amazon's routing technology, filling in documentation"
good,"It was an easy job but some of the management/workers either had the degree and didn't know how to use it in the field that they worked or they didn't have the degree but knew how to  do the job but since they were not ""qualified"" they were rejected from moving up in the career."
good,Amazon is a great place to work with super smart team of DBAs. Peers are always there to help you. Feedback from customers is very important at Amazon.
good,Amazon development  centres provides all kind of support and training ang always appreciate hardworking of the employees. They always take care of the workplace and keep on taking suggestions for new creative ideas
good,"The compensation and benefits were excellent, and the co-workers were great overall.  But there was too much drama and inconsistency with the management."
good,I like it but they work you to the bones. being time to go the bathroom. short break are least than 5 mins. 5 mins to walk to lunch room then 5 mins back and sign in station a min before break over.
good,"It is a great company with great leadership principles."
good,"I am working since November 2015 in Amazon fulfillment center Carteret NJ USA, as a part-time fulfillment Associate."
good,"I am in the problem solve area, so i fix the damaged packages that get bought to me. Its very time consuming so your never standing around doing nothing. I like that position better than scanning. Nobody is constantly on  your back about the small stuff in that area."
good,A good way to begin to work. Managers are Ok and give their best interest to guide you. They are means of transport to the warehouse from different locations.
good,It was Productive and fun workplace I learned to work with different people from different backgrounds. The environment was exciting because something was always going on.
good,"I like the job, it pays well but if you a willing to work you have to be single because if you have a family needs that you have to miss work or go home for be careful and if you run of of UPT (Unpaid Time) you are finish. But besides that I liked working for the company."
good,"The diversity in the workplace is excellent, there's plenty for those who prefer to work alone and those who cooperate with others."
good,It's a fun place to work at exciment alive. There's always overtime can use your pto or vacation time right away. You will lose weight just by working here.
good,"I love everything about the place, it's a great place to work for. I am able to help customers with obtaning anything available with just touch of a fingertip."
good,"The job that amazon offert to me was very hard and a lot of hours."
good,"Working in Amazon was my first job in a corporate environment after graduating from university and I worked in the Transaction Risk Management Services department."
good,"A normal day at amazon consist of picking, stowing, and truck unload/loading. I would start my day by picking items, that would appear on my scanner. Then after lunch break I would load the remaining trucks that needed to go out before the day was over with."
good,"as a temporary associate out at amazon, I loved it I was in HRV inspecting jewelry. I always made my tack times and was a modeled worker. Amazon is very physical and stressful depending on the job your at."
good,"Fast paced, good paying, the only con would be the long hours and days away from family, unless you get a reasonable schedule or department then you're good!"
good,"Amazon is the best warehouse that i have worked with because it is fun while working, team work is excellent and good working condition."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at amazon.  I enjoyed most of the people I worked with, and learned a lot about how to lead, and be efficient."
good,The warehouse Area Managers needs to follow up with their associates to give appropriate feedback. I learned a lot about leading a department.
good,"Amazon was one of my favorite jobs. If you work hard there are plenty of opportunities for growth. There are so many good skills to learn at Amazon, and there is always management nearby to help. There are plenty of opportunities for overtime and extra work, and great incentives."
good,Amazon brings alot of different oppertnuity to learn and move up into the company. The safety standards are higher then I have seen in a company. Altough the production standards/quality are high I find them to be a tool to challange myself to do better and more
good,"It is awesome, great experience. Fun culture had lot of fun , looking for carrier growth, work hard have fun make history. Over all good experience , loves sodexos."
good,As long as you do your job it's easy to meet standard. Hold on to your stock as long as you can goes up every year. Work hard have fun make history!!
good,amazon is a great company to work with only down side is not knowing if you will keep your job at the end of a contract but if you work really hard then you have a great chance
good,"Working with amazon wasn't easy but it was a lovely experience."
good,"Working at Amazon was an experience that I will not forget. A typical day at work would have included clocking in at my start time and normally working 10-12 hours a day. I would have to be on my feet at all times working from truck to truck packing them, or I would have to divert packages during the day. It was really well managed to the point that we met quotas really often. I was able to rely on nearly all of my co-workers to keep up with everything and we would help each other where it was needed. The hardest part of this job for me was the drive, I had to drive ~2 hours to get there plus another 2 hours to get home. This drive would have to be the worst thing about the job. The most enjoyable part was the environment in which I worked in."
good,"Good place to work and have fun. "
good,"My days started and ended with 100% productvity. Working at Amazon taught me to push myself to achieve more and be more productive with less time. I found it most difficult part of the job was managing my time with larger sets of work. However, the best part about working for the company was the unity, benefits, and holiday dinners."
good,Go place to work for. A learning experience great benefits able to find out about what this provide for you. A enjoying place to work for. And great employee
good,"you come in you stretch with the group then off you go straight to picking in a giant 3 floor building.Timing was everything in amazon from how fast you can get from one item to another and finding the best shortcuts to make your way throughout the building."
good,"Training was real fast paced and by the time you hit the production floor it feels like you haven't retained any of the information, however you soon discover that things are quite basic and all you need to do is follow the lead of the system and be customer obsessed. Management is so approachable, team leaders are so helpful and coaching and feedback takes place on a weekly basis. I developed from a Retail Representative to Amazon Locker Specialist to Concession Abuse Prevention within a space of 6months. There's continuous room for growth, however there are really challenging customers who may expect a bit too much from Amazon. Though I love my colleagues and the environment, our breaks are so closely monitored and too short, which is the norm for call centers."
good,The best thing about this work place is the Benefits they are affordable and very good. The hours are just really long. Wish they had eight hour shifts.
good,"The job really great."
good,"- Dive deep"
good,The job is good paying with good benefits but is vary tiring and hard on your body because of hard floors and also has long hours. The benefits are awesome though.
good,Amazon was a great place to work. Although they required you to work long days it was well worth it. I would consider going back to this company if the opportunity suited me.
good,My typical day at work  I come in talk to management and my co-workers get my assignment's and begin to unload the trucks. the hardest part is getting the all of the trucks that are signed in unloaded and back out on time.
good,"I enjoy working at Amazon. However, I am having a tough time with the night shift, which runs from 6pm-4:30am. I am a wife, and mother of 3. I am one of the few odd ones, who enjoys all of the walking, and physical aspects of the job."
good,the management and workers are really friendly and it makes it nice to wake up everyday and go to work because you know that you will have a great day.
good,I really enjoy work for amazon but I have a very big growing family and I need more money and less hour a day. The ten hour shift is the hardest because I have very small children that need my help with homework.
good,"Very good company to work in for experienced people and for the people who are just out of college, very good opportunity to gain wonderful experience."
good,Good Place to work with some exceptions of management. There is a lot of benefits including entertainment at work. There is even a HR Office on site.
good,"I was graveyard shift , it was  the  hardest part of the job. "
good,work was simple and easy. you felt like everyone was family you spent so much time with them. But i did fell like i was there more than home
good,"work hard, make history. The name will precede you. This company can legitimately be called a ""Disruptor"" and perhaps even a world-changer. Customers love it and it's amazing to watch it all unfold at times. It's a pleasure to be even a small part of that."
good,"Amazon was a lot of physical work. A typical shift at work involves walking 20-25 miles, meeting a required rate, and making sure the quality of your shipments is perfect. Management was great, they were also pushing the workers to do the best they can without being too harsh on us. The hardest part of the job was the physicality of it: lifting, bending, walking for 10 hours wears your body down fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing what was expected of you and that sense of joy and accomplishment you feel when you exceed those expectations. Amazon would not hesitate to recognize hard work."
good,Good place to work. Part time hours. never more then 20 hours a week. Very flexible set my own schedule. Very well organized and structured.
good,Amazon is a good place . You do get promoted and moved around but is worth it. Your benefits and composition is ecxcellent.
good,"Typical day at work: Walking 15 - 20 miles a day in this warehouse, picking items from several different mods. The requirement is picking 125 units per hour, but I average 172 picks per hour. "
good,"I've been a Picker at Amazon for over 9 months, and I do plan on staying here for awhile...It just fits me better than dressing all up for a corporate job, which I could easily get considering that I have a college degree..But this job just gives me the peace of mind of knowing if I just come to work to work and not to play and talk all day, then I will have a stress free day at work..The managers are great at Amazon..I can't say enough about how easy it is to talk to them and to get along with them..Probably the best management I've experienced and I've worked for a few other Fortune 500 companies....Another thing about this job that is awesome is the work scheduling...Most work schedules give you three consecutive off days, but all schedules are 4 ten hour shifts and three off days. So life balance is definitely not a challenge at Amazon....In terms of coworkers there's a high turnover..A lot people leaving..A lot of people applying..A lot of temps..Some good..Some scary...Overall coworkers are great , for the most part....The most enjoyable part of  the job for me is driving the OP machine..When I get into my zone, I feel like I'm pacman in a video game or something as I'm bobbing a weaving through the k-racks trying to be as productive as possible throughout the day...You can easily make this job fun for yourself, if you have a good imagination.....Amazon has great benefis, 3 to 4 raises a year, Tuition Assistance program if you want to go back to school, stock options, etc...Considering the level of Easy this job is, If you're a laid back person like I am , who could care"
good,I had a good time working with amazon . I learn how to work with other . I learn how to keep working when mad .I learn how to work long hours. I had the best co-worker that u can have at a job. we all got along real good .
good,"I am currently working in Outbound picking, a typical day means picking items to fulfil customers orders for 9 and a half hours at a rate of an average 90 items/hour. It is quite challenging as I often walk a marathon every day but it is rewarding in terms of good health and fitness. I also am moving a lot in between departments as we have a cross training policy at Amazon. The management is great, they help a lot, they often participate in processes in order to train better, most of them are highly skilled and trained. The hardest part of the job is to mentally adapt to the effort, after four days of walking your feet are like jelly no matter how fit you are but there's a great satisfaction when you (quite often) are smashing the targets and get the recognition from your leader (along with other rewards)."
good,"The job is easy, but you are busy from the moment you start to the moment you finish!"
good,The work culture is one of the most amazing thing about Amazon. You get to learn a lot about management and how the world works in a retail sense and catalog wise. There were a lot of challenging works that keeps you going even though the work load is a lot. It was an enjoyable experience.
good,"We all get together in the morning , talk about are plan of goal of how many packages need to be packed out for the day. You get stationed at a place where you work and pack all day, sometimes you get rotated into a different function depending on the work of labor or where your trained. I've learned to work in both departments, and be trained in different functions because of the ability to learn quick. The management is very nice and helpful when need of a day off or sick. The co-workers are very interesting some are easy to get along with others very quite and just go to get the job done. The hardest part of the job would probably be standing and walking for ten hours if you don't get your 8 hours of sleep. The most enjoyable part of my job is during the holidays they do some BBQs for as on the lunch breaks or give us random pizzas days, for successful days of goal accomplishment's."
good,Picking using scanner pick products from the library shelves. Operate forklift. Take item from them into boxes the customer.
good,"everything is go, go ,go."
good,"A crazy day at work"
good,"A career with amazon is typical of the Amazon tagline- 'Work hard, have fun and make history' The company is excellent when it comes to opportunities and internal growth. The best part of Amazon is its amazing work culture. The dress code is no where close to formal and the employees can express their views in a much open environment. A typical day at work for me involves facilitation sessions for new hires. The other best part about Amazon are the people.. you will meet some Amazing people..!!!"
good,"I really enjoyed getting to know the employees and becoming good friends with them. The competitive part of the job always had me working harder. I would get to the top of the list for going really fast. It was a really great job even though it was only seasonal, I loved it. The management was really understanding and made work fun for us.The hard part of the job was getting up really early morning, but it did make me feel better about my day because once I would get off work I would still have the rest of my day left."
good,"It was great working at Amazon. It goes as its slogan ""Work Hard. Have fun. Make History "" . There is hard work and fun both at workplace. I improvised my problem solving skills and logical and analytical thinking ability.I had a very good team and so "
good,"Each day would be assigned to job for the day. Was trained to stow, prep, receive and pack. Was a problem solver to assist in correcting information to connect p.o. information to products. Was a peak Ambassador , who trained and assisted  anyone needing help with their job assignments. Had good managers and co-workers. Enjoyed my job everyday as I try to be a positive energetic reliable person. Made rate daily and was among the 10% above required rates. Had overtime if wanted."
good,"i like to drive "
good,"Typical days at work can be very steady, but tedious. Communication of the work standards and requirements are on constant display. It requires constant awareness and a fast-paced sense of direction. The hardest part of the job since I was employed & working overnight, was not counting the long hours until break or end of shift."
good,"The workers are very diverse.The pay is great and they gave everyone a free pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving, which was appreciated. My only cmplaint is the long hours and short breaks. Not a job for lazy people."
good,"As i was a fresher, Amazon was the first company i ever worked with. It is a fun place, great working environment. Co-workers are fun, understanding and very flexible. Had a great learning experience, learned about product styling and how does an e-commerce run. The most enjoyable part of the work was music while working."
good,Amazon treats their employees with nothing but respect and favor. I have nothing bad to say except the over time during the Christmas season can be terrible on your personal life but should be expected do to the nature of the job.
good,amazon having very awesome culture.no dress code and no micro management.i really want to work in amazon again but in Gujarat only
good,"enjoyed working here there is always room for growing in the company and becoming apart of the management team. although the hours are long and strenuous, it was a fun work environment"
good,Ho imparato ad orientarmi in un grande magazzino ed ho imparato a lavorare in una squadra dove ogni dipendente è fondamentale per la produttività e per la crescita dell'azienda.
good,It is a steady-paced work environment with many employees and job positions. I've learned the importance making the best use of my time due to deadlines for packages to be shipped out and working as a team. Management was mediocre. I was very isolated while working there. There were issues of racism in the work facility. I was treated disrespectfully by fellow co-workers and some management. The hardest part was the extremely long hours away from home. The most enjoyable part was the paycheck and incentives they gave us for working hard.
good,"Excellent Leadership Crew in Concord, NC location"
good,"Every day is inspiring, always teaching new things and always raising the bar to help us reach the next level."
good,"Meus dias de trabalho são corridos, devido ao atendimento ao público ser de prontidão, sempre visando a excelência de nossos clientes."
good,"Our main focus is the customers making sure we get the others out on time and correct.  I have learned a lot by working in Amazon, the way we focus on customer service is excellent.  My manager and co-workers are fun to work with, will always to out there way to help others.  The hardest part of the job is the hours."
good,Fun and also a encouraging workplace where I could enhance my talents and as well as to fullfill my expectations. I being a customer relationship executive felt about being given the power to directly interact with the customers and complete my sales requirment to the company
good,"place extremely focussed on tasks and jobs"
good,"Fast work pace,however is a fun work environment. If you stay on top of your rate you're good! Can get hectic at times! Everyday it is 10hr shifts with 2 15 minutes breaks and 1 30 minute lunch break."
good,"Worked with Amazon for almost one and half years and was always excited to go to work. I worked as a Transaction Risk Investigator where my job fluctuated between extremely stressful at times to moderately stressful. The work culture totally depends on an individual to interact with others and enjoy the fun on the floor. The bigger the team, the better you have fun. Our team consisted of 24 people and there was always someone to reach out to whenever you're bored or needed a coffee break. However, that was ruined with different time shifts for everyone though. Also, managers were very supportive at work. Overall it's a great fun and balanced work place if you think you can handle stress."
good,"I worked for some time in Amazon development center back in India as a Process associate. I used to speak to new people every day and got to know many new things about them. In Amazon, it's all about the way you present yourself to the customer and provide the best service to them they deserve. My communication and management skills have reached a new height after I started working there. The environment there is very friendly and casual. We used to have fun events during our work which would reduce our stress to great extent."
good,"Very typical warehouse job with the following exceptions:"
good,"I worked as a Resolution lead at Amazon.com. My job duties included taking customer escalations, chatting with associates when they needed help, a policy exception, etc. The environment was wonderful, but at Amazon you have to embrace change to truly thrive there. I went through several managers and leads on my teams before I left. A lot of management turnover."
good,Everyday would log into scanners and go start picking. It was always busy and tiring but would be fun to pick more orders than other people.
good,"Amazon is a good place for work, especially on the seller support side.  The benefits are good and the pay is reasonably high, especially for the area I live in. "
good,basically same as the other one. full time hard labor work as a team shipping products in and out the building. warehouse type environment. provide e.xcellent service for our consumers.
good,"great hours"
good,"Working at an Amazon warehouse is a great real world experience. Your managers are there to help you do better and make sure to hit your rate marks, but they also overall check how you are doing from time to time. This company is very strong on the safety of their employees. There is a great opportunity for growth if you apply yourself and work hard; you do not have to be the best in your area to move up within the company. There is a very diverse group of employees everyone works hard, but also can find time to socialize with one another. The pay with this company is great, you can really catch up on bills or even school loans extremely fast with this company. As part of the Integrity Staffing employees you are paid weekly, while amazon employees are paid bi-weekly."
good,"Very strenuous on your body."
good,Work is very easy because of the proper installed  modern  electronics and software application to an extent. The uniformity regularty and all good  treatments that a company needed is properly followed. The co-worker  that i  got is extremely  inspirable and helped alot to work hard and to get better result.
good,"Management was perfect, they were understanding and handled everything with proper work ethics. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the long work days. The most enjoyable part about working for Amazon was the coworkers and managers encouraging you to do better, as well as helping you when you need assistance. Amazon is very flexible, and a nice place to work. With the laid back dress code its makes the day easier to get through and more comfortable."
good,"Entertaining most days."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for.  There is a lot you can do with the company if chosen to do so. The only con is not knowing someone to get up the ladder faster.
good,"great place to work, what liked the most was the 10h shift. and what I didn't like was the slow time. But overall it's a great place to work, we have free lunch sometimes, gift card......"
good,"Work Hard Have Fun Make History, Great learning opportunity, Learning curve never ends at Amazon. It's always day 1 at Amazon, Even after working for 4 years i still feel like its Day 1 at office. Great management."
good,"- Easy moving with client"
good,"The past year working with Amazon has been a really positive experience. I have leaned many skills to deal with online account management, coding and online redemption."
good,"long shift"
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for - the people are great and the opportunity to grow and share ideas are endless."
good,Great Company to work for. The only negatve thing is standing for 10 hours. They have attendance bonuses during Peak Time to assure you have perfect attendance.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Amazon.com The workplace was fun and very productive. They have a strong sense of teamwork and leadership there. They also care about their employees and ensure that they are feeling good so our customers have a great experience when they need our assistance over the phones. The primary work performed was done via phones, chat, or email. The associate was responsible for correcting order issues, changing payment types, also correcting and verifying shipments. The only down side for me was the hours went from working 7am to 3:30 pm then they suddenly had me working later and later hours. They did give you plenty of paid time off during a course of a year and sick time if needed. I would recommend they pay more than 10.00 an hour, not sure what they have CSA's working at now-a-days."
good,"Very good place for work and working culture is to good. Typical Day shift but routine kind of work. In my process i could not able to learn much. Co-workers and Management are good."
good,"It was really a nice time at this job where I interacted with clients from US, helping them with their queries in email and chat process."
good,"Great place to work they reward employees, its clean and safe, they cater to the needs of employees. This company likes to have fun but is also very professional . during holiday season the do custom contest and gift give aways."
good,"The days would get pretty routine so we would always try keep things fun and moving. We would do call blocks and every time someone would hang tell us no and hang up on us e would do 20 pushups afterwards. It would help incentivize us to never give up."
good,"Every day was like a challange. I've gained alot of experience at this company. Ofcourse - friendly people. The most enjoyable part of the job was to instruct new hires and managers. Teaching people to do one thing or another, how to do everything properly at the same time learning something from them. It was really inspiring and encouraging time!"
good,"A Typical Work day involved Sorting to make rate for 5 hours"
good,"Amazon offers employees a comprehensive benefits package including healthcare starting on day one of employment matching, performance-based bonuses and its Career."
good,"It was fun. It was a great place to work. Silicon Valley is where you meet people. I learned a lot about Technical Business their early, mid, and final stages."
good,I loved working here....by far the best job I've had. I am sorry I had to leave and move away :(
good,"Le temps passe très vite et on ne s'ennuie pas."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced, you mainly kept to yourself and didn't really interact with anyone else. The hardest part of the job was constantly using the step ladder to get up and count the bins, then going all the way down to being on your knees multiple times an hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was I had no distractions and I could finish my job with no interruptions."
good,"Amazon.co.uk is a fun place to work, health and safety policies are taken v seriously. holiday and sick pay is paid and in return company wants your full dedication at work. work load sometime gets a bit too high as there's a lot of walking for pickers and strict targets have to be met by employees.all in all good organization to work for."
good,"i am proud to say that i am part of amazon instant video, AIV is the movie application where customers can the enjoy the unlimited streaming online, Since the applications itself is designed to have fun  to the customers, so one can imagine how much employees will have inside the bay, Amazon has this Bean Bag culture , where in one can lie down in bean bag and work, we will bean bag fights, Overall it is truely fun being here, as far the work for a tester is concerned, its like a playground."
good,"Typical day at Amazon starts with a scrum meeting where team members discuss their status on the project. I learned a lot from my mentor and team members while interning at Amazon. Both, my mentor and manager, were extremely patient and helpful throughout my internship. The hardest part of the job for me was the designing phase and the most enjoyable part was the implementation phase."
good,"If you like walking and the quiet this is the perfect job for you, just make sure that you hit the required quota or else you may find your quiet world a little louder. The job benefits and people wise is great, even the work place is great. The rules and guidelines though are sometimes to strict for some human beings, as I found out. Although my time here was short I never really had one complaint about this job."
good,"A typical night started off the same every night. A meeting followed by stretches. You were then assigned a section to count and depending on where you started there was a required rate for accuracy and time. I've never had any problems keeping my numbers up and while working hard to keep my rates up, it really made the 10hr work shift fly by. There wasn't really anything difficult about the job at all. Trying to keep your numbers up throughout the night made a great challenge every evening I clocked in. It also gave you a little bragging rights at each meeting when announced that you had a great night."
good,"Working at Amazon was a great experience. Everyday you are required to move product at a certain rate every hour, when you do above rate you are congratulated but when you perform poorly you will be written up. This company tries hard to make it's employees happy by providing holiday meals such as thanksgiving lunch, pizza parties on you birthday, softball teams among associates, and a basketball hoop game in to break room. I've learned the procedures in trailer dock and release, I took a introduction class in the rules and theory of operation a power industrial truck. The co-workers there are the best people you will ever meet, we established an ""Amazon friendship"". Also this job provides great benefits, great pay, and offer plenty of voluntary and mandatory overtime."
good,"Unload trucks, receive the product, and put it away. I was there P.I.T. trainer. Inventory control. Was on the safety team."
good,typical job nothing fancy hard work but so is most warehouse jobs.
good,"I liked working with my hands. I counted inventory, or would sometimes be sent to find certain items and have them designated to different areas of the building to be shipped out to customers. Manual Labor always makes me feel better, and leaves me feeling like I accomplished something everyday. I liked working with others, but I preferred working alone more because it was less distracting. I always enjoyed setting new goals for myself to try and do better."
good,Amazon was a great company to work for.. It had great benefits and stock opportunities. Amazon is definitely a customer first company and very efficient with their procedures. Safety is a key role with this company which is very important and I really enjoyed the fast pace work environment.
good,Amazon is a great company with room to grow but need more overtime!
good,"I went to work with enthusiasm and made lots of friends"
good,"-Write descriptions for products"
good,"Cool place to work. Job was tedious at times, but it gave you a great workout. Overtime, your body would get used to it and you would be fine. The pay was Awesome! Only thing is it was a seasonal job which didn't last very long."
good,in amazon I worked fulltime at night shift is was really nice working in a friendly enviroment
good,"All the co-workers are workable,your surrounding is always pleasant."
good,"Its a super cool place where its fun time from the the moment you enter office until you exit. Its a flat organisation. You get to learn a lot of qualities from the company and its policies."
good,Challenging and rewarding environment but with hinderances in advancement
good,"During my entire tenure at Amazon.com, I learned how to sort boxes and maximize space on trailers and pallets to help Amazon.com achieve their goal which is a customer centered experience in terms of selling products and customers receiving products on time. Long hours are the hardest part of the job. Also, during my time at Amazon.com, I enjoyed a discount while ordering stuff for  myself online. In conclusion, if you are young it is a good place to work at right out of high school for a couple of years or during college years."
good,the job itself is very tedious and physical but its all about loving all you do by putting your own mind and interest in it. the salary is relatively high and the the managers inculcate discipline in the workplace but are also friendly to workers
good,fast paced job pulling orders for customers for 10 hours a day very healthy walking great environment to work at.
good,"10+ hr shifts, great coworkers. Love the environment, great management."
good,Management was approchable and understanding. The job was physically challenging but in a fun way.
good,This company is good to their employees. Hard job but worth it.
good,But it takes some getting used to. It's physically demanding but it does get easier.
good,It was great to be a part of Amazon. Looking forward to find a similar one.
good,I would never be bored and not want to leave work due to my work pace. I learned how to use a scanner well and work around a lot of people. The management was great and tried to help any problem that could be solved. My co-workers weren't really to happy due to their age and long hours. The hardest part about my job was the last couple hours of work because you knew how much time you had left. I enjoyed working at a fast pace to try and when the picking competitions that we had.
good,"I enjoyed to work at amazon, and be involved in peek season. I enjoyed to help get many Christmas presents to children everywhere on time to continue the magic in their life."
good,A great company to work for. I have worked there for 1 year and have enjoyed the work culture.
good,A great company to work for. I have started my career with this company and ended up staying there for 5 years due to its work culture and learning opportunities i had got there.
good,"My experience was positive. My duties included keeping the box supply full for packer, load lines, label, divert boxes to trucks, load trucks, and keep work area neat."
good,"Good schedule, very motivated staff to meet our daily goals."
good,They made it to the point were it wasn't just about working all day by providing fun for you and family.
good,working alone side of co-workers is fun and very productive place to be
good,"I had a great experience managing the inbound department of an Amazon Fulfillment Center. The challenges I faced kept me engaged and motivated every part of every day. The people I worked with, both the associates and the leadership team, were professional, genuine and simply good people which made the experience much more meaningful. Amazon’s culture is inspiring; it incorporates all the aspects of positive leadership and motivating high performance. I would recommend anyone who asks me to work for Amazon."
good,Amazon is a great company that will challenge you everyday to your limit. Always striving to improve processes in order to enhance the customer experience that will fuel growth. Company is developing leaders to have engaging interactions with associates. Great pay for management but expect a challenging work life balance.
good,work-life balance is good
good,"Sometimes slow sometimes fast paced, everyone is all about teamwork and looking out for each other. The managers there promote safety and value everyone who works there, their opinions and thoughts."
good,"You learn basics on safety and health around the warehouse, this ensures you can use the equipment safely."
good,Wear comfortable Sneakers because you will be walking all day to pick orders. Everyone complains about their feet hurting at the end of the day. High level of micro managing. Be prepared to be timed on how fast you pick the orders. Be prepared to work in various temperatures.
good,"Schedule was 4 days a week which allowed me to take care of real life issues on weekdays."
good,"I loved working here! It was a great environment and accolades were recognized publicly! However, I was awarded Best of the Best and Quarterly Top Performer one day and let go the next for being 7 minutes late. I was given 40 hours of PTO. I had used that time while sick. You earn 4 hours of PTO for every 8 hours of overtime worked. I had worked 16 hours of overtime, so 8 houra of PTO. I had to use public transportation to get to work. The bus caused me to be 7 minutes late due to snow. I did not realize that once I had worked the 8 hoirs of PTO, it was my responsibility to contact HR to notify them so that the PTO was added to my account. So, when I was 7 minutes late, it appeared as though I did not have PTO to cover it and was let go.every 8 hours"
good,One of the best work experiences I've had in a long time. Good atmosphere for promotion and advancement. They have very good management and actually try to acknowledge every employees personal skills for different jobs on site.
good,"Superbe bonne ambiance, les chef d'équipe y sont à l'écoute, toujour présent en cas de soucis, franchement je ne regrette pas d'avoir travaillé pour eux"
good,Travailler chez Amazon a été l'expérience qui m'a fait aimer travailler dans la domaine de la logistique. J'envisage de même de changer de parcours et faire carrière dans gestion logistique et transport.
good,La empresa se enfoca en la seguridad del personal al 100
good,"Amazon is one of the best places to work in and has a wonderful work culture. It is stress free compared to the  other companies in India."
good,Wanted to go back  to work as me carry on with ma duty packing I’ve hoped to get another job  the reason they release me becos of ma attending but this tym it should not be happen again
good,"Good Company,Good Pay. My only issue is the 10 hour shifts. Management is really nice and the prioritize safety and quality. Typical day is "
good,Easy job left up to 50 pounds and you can pick your days you want to work. Not far and very fair pay. You can’t go wrong with this job. You get paid every Friday.
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work."
good,Good place to work and plenty of exercise. They also make sure that you all succeed at the position your at. I also like the fact they dont focus on rate as much as they used to.
good,"Amazon is growing very rapidly and is going through some serious growing pains and people-scaling issues (ironically, the people scaling is harder than the software scaling side for Amazon).There are multiple job functions at Amazon, and the job functions are so diverse, it may as well be multiple companies. A fulfillment center worker has a vastly different experience than a software engineer."
good,"It's a business with a high current and increasing demand, which requires hard work throughout the day. "
good,It's worth it just for the benefits.  The place is great and they care about you.  They truly support the ideal if you succeed they succeed.  Just give it a try but it's work understand.
good,"excellent experience, good treatment and comfortable"
good,"enjoyed working there. they worked with you in every way they could.good benefits,hours,and enjoyed going to work everyday. Would go back to work for them again"
good,"Perfect work-life balance. Great management and easily approachable leadership team. Good benefits. However, the salary structure could have been better. But, given the work-life balance, one would not mind working in Amazon."
good,At amazon as an associates had great experiences. I got to meet a lot of great individuals and to work with them was great and fun.Amazon really does try to take care of the individuals that want to move up in the company and make a job into a career.
good,"The job was very clear on the duties I was required to do , the daily cycle helped me perfect my work. The hours were just what I needed and always had the opportunity for overtime as well."
good,It’s a very good job friendly people good opportunity a lot of work but worth it for some people I would rather work to face to face with people . And do team work
good,"For me the great thing about Amazon is that it's very physically demanding, it will give you a great work out in keeping on your feet and always on the move!"
good,"Easy job, requires no critical thinking, but fast paced and physical. Safety is big there, so to the point that some of it actually seems ridiculous, best to be safe though. They Do not have unrealistic work expectations, men and women in their 50's, 60's doing just fine. Decent pay and benefits for what it is. The short breaks are within the law, but the factory is massive and places to sit down are to far away.  Also no music, which sucks."
good,Working at Amazon is a privilege and I say that because of the culture. A fast paced environment with lots of moving parts and people. Time management is important along with attendance ‘
good,"They should offer 3 shifts and optional overtime.  People have fell I'll from exhaustion working in their buildings..Other than that its has great benefits that start day 1. They offer amazon stock, short and long term disability ect."
good,"I have only started working for amazon recently and I really enjoy the work but unfortunately I just am not getting enough hours"
good,"I love how great their store is; how great their food is; and how great the pay rate is. What I don’t like about this job is how many hours they offer me. So far in the month of December, my supervisor only drops shifts for two to maybe three days a week, such as Sunday, Monday, and maybe even Saturday."
good,"Hours conflicted with family matters very structured schedule . Maintainable , easy team work , unlimited over time , good location , good hours reliable job description"
good,"You either pick, stow, or unload trucks. It’s was all pretty easy and work will go smoothly as long as you are fast. For picking, all you do is pick customer orders from the shelves. For stowing, you stock items onto shelves. Unloading trucks would mean you would take packages out of the trucks and put them on conveyer belts."
good,Expectations are often high but was willing for flexobilty hours were 100 percent guaranteed. Strict management and job security was the only thing i could find bad. One mess up and your outta there. Use your paid time off only for emergencies
good,"Working With Amazon was a great experience. Low work pressure, good entertaining time and other benefits."
good,"- no longer hour of work"
good,"I liked working at Amazon. The people were friendly and energetic.  There is a large learning curve that you have to be ready for. The training is very in depth. Once you hit the floor, you will have an arsenal of information to assist the customer with their needs."
good,"Job was comfortable to work in, the view from the offices was amazing. The ability to get help when needed was excellent. Often had pizza, or coffee, or other food brought to the offices. Great place to work."
good,"j'ai passé un bon moment, les responsables étaient au top et puis le travail était moins stressant par rapport à d'autres entreprises."
good,"All you have to have is good time management skills and be self motivated the job as flex driver is easy and provides flexable schedule, You have to be self disciplined for this job to be a great fit for you"
good,"Amazon aim at providing exceptional customer service to its customers. its ability to do that is solely based on the well-being of its employees also known as 'Amazon family"" that strives to keep a smile on every customer's face."
good,"Good place to work , no dress code . great managers , place to grow , equal opportunity partner , great co workers , everything else is good.........................................................................."
good,Amazon is a great place to work only if you can do the intense walking everyday. Its awesome pay and the labor isn't hard at all. I love the job but dislike the up and down stairs which puts a strain on my body. Fantastic company they work with their employees to accommodate their needs.
good,"A great starting job, or a job for someone looking for fast easy cash, only downside would be that there isn't a lot of room for raises or promotions."
good,"As an Amazon picker, your main responsibility will center around gathering products for order fulfillment from your supervisor. In addition to this core function, you will also be responsible for labeling certain types of merchandise and ensuring that adequate stock levels are being maintained."
good,"Worked at Prime warehouse in Erdington , Birmingham. Hours/shifts was okay and wages. Friendly management."
good,money could go up for amount of work but apart from that i will go back as and when i can in the future as i enjoyed the work and the people i worked with
good,Lots to learn each day hence you improve a lot with the growing experience. Always challenging and makes you think out of the box. Amazing experience!
good,"L'environnement de travail est très stimulant car vous avez l'occasion de travailler avec des personnes très intelligentes. De plus, vous bénéficiez de nombreux avantages sociaux."
good,great place to work in competitive environment with all world class facilities. no restriction on work style employee need to deliver the results as agreed.
good,I left once we got new management because of how things started to run. Overall good benefits & good place to work. Takes time to get use to working the long hours
good,Great people great management  overall I had a great experience with them I recommend anyone to go and get a job from them I love my job and all they did for me
good,It was a good job due to me being a mother and having to maintain a work and home life. I quit due to person reasons but Amazon was very understanding. I am interested and willing to return. The first few days are hard on your body but once you're use to it everything is simple.
good,"The job is easy, essentially shopping for others as if it's your shopping list. Learning the store makes the job incredibly easy to complete earning your pay."
good,"An overview of my experience at the Amazon fulfillment center in Plainfield includes an exceptional experience. Everyone in Amazon was treated with respect and got along, also everyone was helpful to each other. The job was my first warehouse job and it gave me good experience with work rate and efficiency."
good,Amazon.com was a good job with good pay I can't really remember about the benefits. I would go back to picking at Amazon.i would really recommend to job to others.
good,a typical day consisted of me stacking and wrapping pallets and sorting items to be shipped out. We had a scheduled lunch which was nice. a very different experience from a 9 to 5 job
good,Everyone who I worked with was very helpful when t was needed and they were accepting and made me feel like I was apart of the Amazon family. I would definitely recommend the job to a friend.
good,"Joining Amazon was one of the best choices I could have made in my career journey. Upper management is open to feedback and respond fairly quickly. While the job can sometimes be physically demanding, people are there surrounding you willing to help you with any issues you may be having. "
good,"Amazon runs on efficiency, and they do value feedback and ideas from all levels of employees to make things more efficient. "
good,Every day is a new competition for everyone which new learning and  problems and ability to learn those. It is a nice for growing yourself in such advance working techniques.
good,"Amazon is a decent place to work. They've got a good wage for entry-level associates, and opportunities to move up within the ranks. But, the work is boring and the hours are long (10hrs-days, 12hrs-nights)but they(management) make somewhat of an effort to keep you going with little snacks, competitions for who can work the fastest(safely), and occasional food-parties when the company does especially well after a quarter or big event. The only thing that sucks is that when you've worked there for over two years like I have, it's easy to complain about doing the same old thing every day(basically just picking, packing, counting, palatalizing, and moving all sorts of inventory around the warehouse via powered industrial trucks). "
good,Was seasonal here 3x. Great place with good pay. Everything is cut and dry tgey train u...then u do ur job. They never ask u to do something u don't kno and are very supportive of reaching your goal...overall not a bad place.
good,"Working at the Chesapeake location was awesome. Management was nice and co workers were always there ready to work. "
good,Great place to work with a friendly environment. They really understand how important a work life balance is and will strive to give it to you. Expect to work hard it is a physically demanding job but it has plenty of great benefits.
good,I worked 12 hr shifts which wasn’t bad but management was really bad as we we’re suppose to rotate where we worked every break but they gave in to people complaints about the jobs mostly rebinning and i would usually get stuck working that the entire shift and even when i did Ask to pack they said we have no one to take you’re spot or they said I’ll get back to you on it
good,"Management was understanding and engaging. Work was plentiful, And my hours were great! I didn't really ever go home extremely tired or never felt overworked. Their benefits were great and there's plenty of room for advancement"
good,"I was hired as a Virtual Customer Service Rep and worked from home. The training is very in depth but, fun and active. It is extremely easy for those who are very attentive and have a key eye for attention to details. Overall, it is a good place to work for that is very laid back and management is awesome! Pay seemed to be below average but I have heard that it has changed since I worked for them back in 2016. I would definitely go back and you could get as much Overtime as you wanted."
good,"It was a fun and exciting place  to work with, I met a lot of very interesting people and we cranked it up when we had to during peak season. The hardest part of the job was picking it up after last break I loved the work schedule and I also trained new associates as well"
good,"It took alot of discipline to stand there for 10 or more hours working , however its gave me time to think about what i really want to do in life & how i will take initiative to work hard to get where i wanna be."
good,"They have different shift so mine was in the morning, ready to work 10 hours a day, under pressure, I learned to do a couple of things, most of the time I was just receiving, there is a lot of Spanish cultures, so I don't know why they still require English speaking to be hired when inside the company they speak their language en 90% of people working there speak Spanish and they do the job without knowing the language. People say the hardest part if outbound."
good,"Working at Amazon was exciting. They have a great pay rate, and great benefits. However it is physically demanding, So I would think take that into consideration before applying."
good,"As a flex driver, I am my own boss. I choose my hours and even the location where I would like to pick-up packages. I enjoy it because it allows me to be there for my family and still get some work outside of my home."
good,Bonne relation avec les salariés! Bonne ambiance!!
good,"Great way to interact with different people, the work isn’t that hard but you do get recognized for going above and beyond. The management is really nice too"
good,Enjoyed my time here with this company. Worked hard everyday with a great team and made our goals monthly. Great career to get into i just need more money and a better career.
good,Would work there again. Get ready for long hours. Laid back people along with the management. I learned alot of different positions during my time at amazon.
good,Amazing company to grow as an IT professional. Started here with no IT background and in less than a year I learnt so much about Networking and Data centers from the countless amazing colleagues who will stop at nothing to teach you as much you want to learn
good,"equipe avec le sourire "
good,"high turn over rate. long hours, physically hard work. no holidays off. they do do give aways and give out free things. very hard job to stay motivated at."
good,"Amazon takes everything from you during your 4 day work week, but also is respectable to the 3 days off and allows you to fully be away from the desk."
good,"Every day at work began and ended the same way due to the structure instilled by the begging and end of day procedures. Which was to inspect and note any changes with the vehicle, as well as to deliver packages and return to station driving in a safe manner. What I learned from Amazon delivery was how to truly manage my time to obtain the best and most efficient work within any time frame. There was always communication with upper management, they handled work effectively. While everyone at work is friendly there is little personal time at work due to the fast pace of work. The hardest part of the job would be being exposed to all weather conditions, namely the harsh ones. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be managing your own work pace. Your work will show for itself constantly keeping you at the constant appropriate pace per individual."
good,"Pay Rate was good. Flexible scheldue, you get enough hours a week so at the end of the 2 weeks your check is worth it. Sometimes the work is worth the money I think they should pay a little more."
good,The job can be stressful at times but the area managers will work with you to allow employees to work and be effective. There are vending machines throughout the warehouse to provide you with the basic supplies required for your job so you may continue working with little to no problems.
good,"Working at amazon was a good experience, it got me warehouse experience, and trainer experience. Amazon was very fast pace as far as meeting goals and stuff"
good,"Ho lavorato in Amazon per 2 anni e mi sono trovata molto bene. Ho molto apprezzato il rispetto nei confronti degli operai, l'educazione nel rivolgersi alle persone."
good,a typical day at amazon consisted of me doing stretches then getting my machine and start picking items for processing. this lasted all night or some nights they would have me in charge of training the new hires. I was certified in training on all the heavy equipment that we used and i trained over 100 people on these machines.
good,Love working at amazon. This is the most easiest part time job to work for. You learn all about the company amazon then they teach you about the warehouse and whats go's on in the building.
good,'I'ts very good working at Amazon. it's new and creative job I like that you are challenged to work harder. Amazon care about their employees.The last time i worked there it was new to me but when i look back it was a great experience. the hardest part of the job was when there was some missing items
good,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new and More on-boarding training before new employees"
good,Loved the time I spent here. If you have pep in your step and are willing to learn.... The skys tbe limit. I went from badic packed to p.a. in less than 3 months.
good,I worked at amazon for 3 years & loved it! The management was great. They understand stuff comes up & they’ve been there for me on more than one occasion .
good,"Promoters help a company advertise its products through marketing campaigns and in-person demonstrations at different types of industry events. They often work for retailers or marketing and advertising firms that assign them to handle a specific product or line of products, such as cookware, furniture, gadgets, or food. Much of their work requires traveling to venues to give presentations and sell products, and both part-time and full-time positions are common. Rather than requiring a formal education, employers mostly look for high school graduates willing to learn about the company’s products and develop techniques for promotion and customer service."
good,"I enjoyed how things continue to change, we were allowed to have friendly competitions amongs our departments, we were allowed to challenge our bosses in processing items made it feel more real and that we were all treated equal"
good,The hardest part was keeping up with my hourly quota as a returns processor.  The Supervisors were always willing to help. I liked the diverse group of people that worked there.
good,"It is a good Place for fresher, working culture is awesome. Management is also good, a disciplineco. Company with values, we try to stick to the company policy first."
good,"Making sure customers get there orders on time."
good,i love the job but as the rate keep climbing it got harder and harder to keep up so when my friend told me about job crops i left amazon but i would always be help to help them
good,"A good place to work in, good team and nee skills learnt everytime. Good place to innovate things where the onnovations are encouraged and supported by superiors."
good,"I worked there for under three years. They taught me how to drive a forklift, but there wasn’t an opening until after my two year mark, annoyingly enough. I was looking forward to using their tuition reimbursement program to go to school, but personal things happened and I had to quit. Still, I enjoyed my time with the company, even though on occasion it would get a little samey week in week out."
good,I enjoyed the team I worked on - it was a supportive group. There are good outlets to use for training purposes - you never feel lost or hitting dead ends as a new hire.
good,"This job is best for fast-paced workers. You have decent management, decent coworkers, and decent benefits. You will never feel a certain way working at Amazon."
good,Easy to come in do your work and leave. Not too much stress but somewhat physical and very fast paced. It was a seasonal part-time job but very stress free. Goals were high but not impossible. Never took work home with me. Some co-workers were annoying but work was so fast paced there was little time to be distracted with that.
good,Amazon is a good company to work for.there benefits are awesome.you work hard fast paced .I dont feel day people make enough money.we should make what overnight shift does we work just as hard if not more.
good,I worked for Amazon for a little over 2yrs. The work place is pretty chill. Good place to start your career. There's a lot of chances to move internally to other processes.
good,Great company lot of opportunities easy to learn a lot of hands on things to do. friendly and professional work environment great pay and benefits as well.
good,"Fun and team work."
good,"Standard Warehouse. Safety concerns are taught regularly. Returns was a lot of computer work and repetitive work. I learned a lot of computer skills, how to train, and about safety. Most of the environment was really fun and full of amazing people, some there for malicious reasons like stealing which made a difficult and distracting day. The most enjoyable part of the job were the managers and the people. No workplace drama and pretty relaxed."
good,"A typical day is 9 to 6 (1 hour lunch break included). Our work culture is very fun, motivating and casual. We use first name terms to talk to even senior leaders."
good,"They call it ""It's still day 1"" in terms of learning in terms of reaching new heights, in being number one and maintaining the level. "
good,"Amazon may not be perfect, but they are good and respectable, one of the best work environments, flexible hours, clean, and steady work. No regrets working at amazon."
good,"Working at the POP-UP is an amazing experience. Very laxed. Management team is amazing. Coworkers are friendly, easy to get along with, enjoyable. You have the ability to be as innovative as you wish."
good,"learn to work well with others, very family liked business , always  answer any questions or concerns we may have or might have had, very fun but very fast paced"
good,"I enjoyed my job has a driver, you don’t have to deal with customers, i go to work, load my van and start delivering. Sometimes my first stop can be 45 mns to an hour away."
good,"For the most part it was a very good job. Hours dont seem to go by too quickly, however if you have someone to talk to you will see your day get over quick."
good,The job was an amazing experience and greatly paid and the managers were really nice and professional.The staff i worked with were very nice and i would definitely recommend working here.
good,"Ne pas écouter ce qui se dit."
good,Working for the CMT in Amazon has advantages and disadvantages. It requires a lot of self discipline and ability.The shifts are varied which can fit most life styles although because you work in the US market the shifts generally start anytime from 3pm onward and end around 12am depending on the shift you are allocated. I work for 40 hours per week.
good,"I honestly enjoy working at an Amazon Fulfillment Center. My fellow coworkers are great, and my managers are professional and understanding. However, it is physically tiring. I take 4 flights of stairs at least 6 times a day for 4 days in a row. Not only I'm mostly standing up for about 9 hours a day, I have to squat, stretch, and climb on step ladders during those whole 9 hours. My body doesn't hurt as much now since I first started, but it gets sore from time to time. Another thing is having to be where you need to be minutes early. If you miss a minute of clocking in for work you lose a whole hour of your pay."
good,Working at Amazing was good. the team is very helpful and team oriented. I learned alot of stuff within a three week time frame. Encourage promotion from within!
good,"Rating is the most crucial part to work in amazon. It was 10 hour per day shift. Rating is a weekly measure of the worker. I was in receiving department where i receive products, scan them and place them in cart. I won't say its the hardest job but its a fast job where you have to work in fast pace. Some managers are too good, they will help you and motivate you so that will work harder without much pressure of the rating. Every person there is very cooperative. Even if you have language problem, you can work there with ease because the people around you will help you. I enjoyed working there as it was my first job in Canada."
good,Good starting point for people that want to do warehouse work. Get to know the environment of the workplace in a warehouse and also get experience so know what to expect in a warehouse.
good,I clock in at 7:25AM and then go to stand up and we find how the day is going to be. Then we get are station assignment. Then we go sign in and then start picking orders for customers. The hardest part of this job is staying motived. The most enjoyable part is the discounts we get.

good,"On a typical day, we started with a morning meeting to prepare us for any changes in the job for the day.

I really enjoy the projects and the continuing push to grow.  I have enjoyed working with almost every manager I have worked with thus far.  "
good,"Gran equipo de trabajo y muy buen ambiente con los compañeros, managers y leaders"
good,"Great opportunity for hours, but difficult to advance. AMazon shows a lot of favoritism and does not look at the person skill set they look at if person is the team attention gether and the most obnoxious."
good,"Great place to work if your into Technology and a lot of collaborative thinking. This job is all about the employee and extremely flexible. Great benefits, plenty of opportunity to make however much money you'd like, and also very cool just to look around."
good,"It is a very relaxed environment, you don't get to use your full scope of practice, you mostly just ice people and hand out braces. You also will have to do all the workers comp cases that come through and assist the safety specialist with audits."
good,It was a good job. I loaded and unloaded trucks. It was usually a two man team. It is very important that you come to work because it is based off a point system. You also have to reach production in some parts of the warehouse.
good,"I like it because you can make friends easy, the day go pretty fast when you r work. Management is kinda ok so far, mayb you can find some you like it"

good,I'm enjoying myself work here honestly. I have fun comunicating with my coworkers to cmplete orders on time and reflecting knowledge of products and thier location. Truly my favorite part of it all.
good,"Amazon is the best place for working I felt, the culture was adaptable to any person. But there should be a change in one's life to know about everything. I feel exploring is the Key to have happiness in life. Working on the same platform may become bored at time, even though I like everything at Amazon I want to go for something good where I want to explore the other field, meet new people and enjoy my work which makes me happy and my contribution to organisation with full satisfaction."
good,Great first time job if never worked before. Easy to learn and great benefits. Nice pay as well. You will enjoy the work culture and managers are caring about safety.
good,"would recommend for the 12 an hour and friendly people but fast paced for 12 hours on your feet a day can catch up to you job not for everyone, sometimes days can feel very long"
good,I like it a lot you would to. Discount good pay. Hours work 3 off 4 working 12 hours shifts. Time goes by fast. Benefits and 401k. You get shares and stocks witj it too.
good,"Its an ok place to work, pays the bills so no complaints. It is physically demanding depending on what department you work in. The management is ok and the site is easily accessed."
good,"working at Amazon is fun, probably the best work environment I have and ever worked in, but the job its self is very repetitive and boring and that just isnt for me."
good,"During my time at Amazon as a Fulfillment Associate, I was able to keep the work area clean and free of obstruction for the safety of the Amazon team. As well, as ensuring that all the incoming packages were safely delivered to their designated locations."
good,"Working at amazon is a fun experience.  Attentive managers always learning something new.  It is definitely fast pace, meaning it will definitely keep you busy."
good,"It is very fast paced. You need to stay going to keep your production up. As long as you pick right, check twice and keep your rates near goal, it is a great place to work. Breaks can be a little short as you have 15 minutes from WHEREVER you are in plant to get to one break room at entrance. Sometimes I didn't get one because of this."
good,Amazon was a different fun environment experience for me I was able to learn a new skill set.If you work there for a year there is room for advancement. While I work there they gave prizes for good attendance and played games to who gave correct answer they won a prize. Also supplies to do the job was always available for you for free.You were able to win Amazon Bucks to purchase merchandise out of there merchandise case. At times the employees who clock in on time when prizes as well.At Amazon they also offered you driving jobs where you can deliver packages to different locations.

good,"My time at amazon can really be described as fun. I was able to interact with many interesting people, both my fellow employees and contracted delivery employees, in a relaxed manner. Safety was a big concern but all the rules were simple and made sense. The scheduling system was very flexible and easy to use allowing me to have a consistent schedule that would only change if I wanted and only to what I wanted it to change to."
good,J'ai aimé  cette entreprise car ont bouge beaucoup jamais sans être inactif
good,"This job was highly stressful, mostly just on your body, but they are very flexible and as long as you have the hours, you can leave whenever you feel you need to. If you run out of time, they're very understanding with Leave of Absences."
good,"L'environnement de travail est amical, les gestionnaires et les dirigeants se soucient de tous les travailleurs et sont prêts à aider et à donner des instructions de travail"
good,"I had such a fun time interacting with my co-workers, learned new things as well, really fit with my college schedual, overall really fun!"
good,"As a high school marketing intern, I would go to work 3 times a week for 4 or 5-hour shifts. During my shift, I worked on improving social media campaigns and developing ideas for the company to work on, with the goal of expanding their consumer base to include teenagers. This was my first job so I learned quite a bit about the tech industry, collaboration, and how to work independently. The full-time employees were very knowledgeable and my team consisted of motivated individuals who were experts in their fields."
good,"It's a good company,we have fan,it's very friendly and we do overtime,we can do to many things,I'm happy with these job.  That's exactly I can get a chance for a new position"

good,its a fast past and good place to learn warehouse work stuff the people are great the hardest put about working there is keeping n remembering every role
good,In total it's about how you make you experience there. It's a stable pace environment it's a routine there. And very friendly. Have rates to meet and expectations to keep. But all jobs do.
good,"A typical day at work is scanning packages, moving packages with a pallet jack, loading or unloading a truck of packages, and many more depending on where you are assigned for the day."
good,Really easy and simple work compared to Fast food. Allow time for you to grow and improve on yourself and your work pace. Doesn't ask for much in return.
good,It can be very stressful on busy and non busy days. When it is busy you are constantly packing and especially when the line goes down a lot and all the orders are backing up and on top of that getting your own boxes and keeping your rate up. On slow days it is mostly just cleaning and restocking boxes. The management can be cool to talk to sometimes. The hardest part is usually restocking the heavy boxes or lifting heavy boxes or keeping your rate up when the line is constantly down.
good,"Would still work for Amazon.ca if they hadn't closed the call centre in town here. "
good,"overall good"
good,i loved working there. i am just extremely disappointed that i was fired because of something i did not actually do and that could not have happened. I did enjoy stocking the shelves to make it possible for the customers to have items to actually order.
good,A typical day at work follows the same routine as any other. The hardest part of this job is that you have to be focused on maintaining a high rate of product picking at all times.
good,"A Day  In Amazon is full of ups, and downs, But its very productive , easy to learn , and the people are very nice that work with you.Its A Good Work Place."
good,The days seemed long at times when work was slow but the environment was friendly and entertaining. I was able to explore different departments because of my manager at the time. The pay is low considering the amount of time we spend on our feet but I did enjoy working there.
good,"iam a person who learn easy and adapt easy at at a new work place."
good,"Amazon es une expérience enrichissante, Les LEADS de l'équipe de STOW en F (Yoann, Nathalie, Julien) , sont géniaux, ils nous suivent nous forment, s'assurent régulièrement que tout ce passe pour le mieux de notre coté, et nous aident a évoluer dans l'entreprise."
good,"little monotonous Productive and Fun environment,"
good,Steady job to work at constantly got things going on to keep you working and not slacking off. Abit fast pace but after some time it's adjustable.I would recommend working here too any friend.
good,"The company has a really good culture. they offer so many incentives fro the employees. I really had an amazing time working there."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for. Everyday is day one and you always find challenges and new things to learn to be able to develop your skills. The hardest times we survive together as a team. The best part of the job that without each other support the job can't be done. Team building and motivation is key part of the job, doesn't matter how difficult or challenging the jobs gets we never forget to have fun on the way."
good,"Very flexible hours and a great job and life balance.  Rarely any issues with customers. Co-workers for the most part were great individuals to work with, other than differences in all of our working styles."
good,"The staff and other workers are friendly. The job is great, face paced and competitive. Safety is a main concern and they will make sure you follow regulations and guidelines."
good,amazon is an amazing workplace for anyone who loves being on their toes. I would definitely recommend this job to any hard worker who loves getting work done and satisfying customers.
good,Fast pace work environment. Short breaks an management needs to work on helping employees with problems. Can be a good seasonal or life job. Good benefits an working hours
good,I really enjoy working here. It is a fun fast paced enviroment. Management will help guide you and help you when needed. Not cut throat and management recognizes hard work and dedication.
good,I have overall enjoyed my time at Amazon.com. But our Facility is closing and I cannot move at this time. I would recommend this company to any as a great place to grow leadership abilities.
good,Fast-paced company. You have to be flexibile. Work hard. Have fun. Make History.  Wear good pair of shoes to work.  Work Hard. Have fun. Make History.
good,"Kre - kindle representative executive "
good,"Préparation des commandes "
good,This job really showed me how to work in a fast paste environment. I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing how my orders are being put together.  great work place.
good,"very busy, sometimes there would be more than one or two other employees in an aisle that you would have to work with all trying to get to different bins to get the items that they need for their orders, some managers were honestly better than others, especially from other departments, some managers seemed to not care, otherwise amazon took care of their employees, they had red robin come in unfortunately we did have to pay for lunch if we wanted it but it was cheaper than at the restaurant, they also had free ritas Italian ice one day, pizza, pretzel factory come with free soft pretzels, there were several TVs in the break rooms, vending machines, water coolers located throughout the warehouse. the best part of the job was probably seeing friends and having fun, the hardest part was working in an aisle with several other employees. Its a very diverse company to work for, they try to help out the best they can, they have on site medical office, like a nurses office limited to the help the can offer, they also have security guards"
good,Es una empresa atenta a las comodidades tanto del cliente como el trabajador que ofrece una buena estabilidad laboral
good,"simply day not hard work , i learned that you need pump your brain ,"
good,"While you are on your feet for the whole 10-hour shift, it is a very good place to work for someone that is able to be physically active for the period of time. The managers are very enthusiastic to help anyone with problems and the training for safety and job position is very thorough to prevent injuries and ensure success.There is always opportunities for advancement to higher positions within the facility."
good,"You cannot determine if management is good by one location each location has variation in management capabilities."
good,Great company culture. They treat their employees far better than most contact centers. Free catered lunch every month and free snacks every week. Cool co-workers and supervisors/managers.
good,"Questionable employee review process, with high employee turnover rate. Amazing warehouse technology and management information systems. day and night shifts available."
good,"Great place to work, great people around hours are good you never feel like you're in a hostile work environment it is quick pace but once you get the hang of it it's no problem"
good,Fun environment lots of activities throughout the year.  Lots of training due to constant change and business improvement. Great job for people who enjoy solving problems to meet customer needs.
good,This is a fun place to work but very fast paced and rate oriented. its pretty easy to get a long with other associates. It is pretty easy to get along with the managers as long as they leave them where they are. There was a big change in managers within the last month but i believe the managers they have in place now are a good fit.
good,"Working at amazon was a blast at first but some positions are hardest then the rest. My time there wasn't so bad, managers were friendly and helpful. The work could be a bit harsh if your slacking behind as the work is strict and timed based. There's a pace in which everyone needed to doing while working but that's not easy to be following the same pace as the people who are better at it. Days are not as bad as other like during thanksgiving, which is the most busiest of time for the company. Hardest part about the job was getting use to the work as it changes back and forth time to time. Sometimes it can be busy or nothing at all to do."
good,This job was a lot of fun. Very competitive and offers a lot of incentives to do well. But they don't play about coming to work and being on time. When business was slow they offered extra time off.
good,"After reading some of the reviews on here, I honestly wonder if we even work for the same company. Maybe Amazon Fulfillment Centers used to operate differently, but I've been a full time, blue badge amazonian for a little over a month & I love it!   Yes, its long hours, yes, its hard work; its a warehouse, what did you expect?  However the pay and benefits are well worth it & I remember working many years under much of the same conditions waiting tables & bartending, though at Amazon I don't have to listen to customers & managers yell at me every 5 minutes.  I also pay approx. $250 a month for myself & spouse to receive quality health insurance as well as dental & vision, that in itself is worth the work I do!  I also started off with paid time off & vacation time accrued from day 1!  The management has been nothing but welcoming & the people are great for the most part.  Yes, the part about having to make rate is true, but their much more reasonable than its made out to be & easily achievable, just stay on task. It has its downfalls just like any other job, but so far the pros far outweigh the cons.  When all is said & i understand that not everyone is going to have a positive experience all the time at even a so called ""dream job"", though I feel many of these negative reviews are written by those who don't have much work experience & therefore little to compare it to, & I almost pity them for reality check they will indefinitely receive.  You want high pay & great benefits without the hard work? Go back to school & get your degree, oh, & Amazon will help with that too. "
good,I liked the job very easy work I just wasn't used to standing for long periods of time . I think I would give it another shot if I had the opportunity to .
good,"Company has outstanding benefits.  They encourage you to learn and advance.  Pay could be a little better, but it is competitive.  Place has a a work hard, play hard attitude."
good,The work culture at amazon is the best. I learned to work in team with different kinds of people. I was put into different shifts but i managed to adjust my personal life accordingly. Overall its a great place to work and grow.
good,"Amazon is a best place for people who are workaholic and can deliver in a challenging environment."
good,"Its a fun environment to work in. I love the energy that comes from Amazon, the friendly people who work there are are well at when it comes to working as a team . They are very open to your ideas, and willing to take action !"
good,"Meet a lot of people, see smiles on their faces when they get what they ordered. Sometimes hard to find places but you can get used to it, tipical delivery job."
good,Open to new hire. Fun work pace. Easy to catch on to with management and supervisor help. I ve learned how to train new hire give them the ability to show that there productivity stands out.
good,The work and environment was fun and relaxed but amazon wouldn't work with my school schedule and had to choose between work and school. The hardest part of the job was the schedule.
good,"10 hour days 4 to 5 days a week "
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. Be wary because it's a pain to get to unless you have a car or ride the shuttle to the site. Be sure to wear form fitting shorts and shirts because the warehouse isn't cooled well. The people and Employers are friendly, just follow the rules and bring you own food..."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time working at Amazon's Fort Worth warehouse.They're a very cutting edge company, and it was cool seeing the robots at work next to us. Its hard work, but you're well compensated. I would definitely consider working for Amazon again."
good,Working on a great product where I have autonomy of my team's direction and the support of leadership to try new things. Compensation growth is tough but good starting.
good,"I really enjoy working here, my manager was fantastic and the fast paced environment was exactly what I was looking for. With it being so hands on the days flew by."
good,">> I got so many friends from my company "
good,A typical day would be scanning boxes to their appropriate pallets. I learned how to work with a large group of people to complete a big task. The hardest part of the job would be continuously walking back and forth between the warehouse. What I most enjoyed was being able to wear anything I wanted and also the weekly pay.
good,"Group Manager roles encompasses people management,  operations and process improvement. Amazon is great place to work as it provides ownership at individual level and allows risk-tasking decisions."
good,I like it pay is compatible the people are easy to work with.Management is very helpful and nice to us for the most part.typical days can vary not necessarily the same thing.The hardest part is maybe standing but the part time hours are only 4 to 5
good,"very long hours but benefits are great."
good,"Used RF scanners with incoming Totes with variety of products and stow it in the robot pod. Also I receive"
good,Amazon had to most amazing benefit and career opportunities that was granted to all of their full time associates. Amazon was a fun and amazing place to work for overall.
good,I enjoyed the steady flow of work and positive attitudes of the employees. There was a lot of walking to be done. So it's always nice to have conversations while walking back and fourth in the workplace.
good,"Cool place to work, your hard work is appreciated and you are provided with incentives for your performance. Work environment is very good and all your senior's your leads will always be there to help you."
good,"I was a picker at amazon which means that I walked all over the store. I could walk about 10 to 12 miles per day. I learned about what all you can buy on amazon and a lot of benefits about being a prime member. There are a lot of people that work there, so when its lunch time it's elbow to elbow their. To end this I would recommend this place to work and i would go back anytime."
good,"Each day at work I pick customer orders, pack them, and then load the orders on the truck."
good,I would find out what my job was for the day and work until the end of the day. Some people I would speak to but I feel too much talking makes you off task. Every one did not see eye to eye at all times however no matter how we felt about each other the work needed to get done and personal drama needed to be put aside to get our work done. Over all I liked my job it worked well with school and other things that came up in my life.
good,"I worked four 10 hours shift in a row until holidays came around. Then my hours went from 40 a week to 50, or possibly 60 a week. It's a fun fast paced job, and I was given an opportunity to become an ambassador, and a few days I would train new people in my specific jobs."
good,"Employees are on their feet for ten to twelve hours daily. Employees have to continue to work hard to make their rate of production or else they may get written up. The job is very demanding because so many customers are ordering online and these orders have to be on the delivery truck in a timely manner. On the other hand, Amazon has excellent benefit packages and they often provide meals to employees on special occasions and holidays. The company also lets employees earn vacation time and get 40 hours of personal time to take away from the company to handle personal business."
good,"Amazon is a fun place to be at. With good leadership and amazing guides provided to help one be highly productive, the only factor for a poor performance would be from an individual himself."
good,"Working at Amazon really tested my limits. As a picker, I walked 10 hours a day all day while picking orders that were being shipped out. The work was tough physically at times, but really improved my endurance and self motivation. During the Holiday seasons the fulfillment center was filled with spirit and hard work. November-December 2016 we were working 60 hour work weeks and while exhausting helped me with efficient productiveness. Besides getting accustomed to the job, the only real problem I had there was the rate system and we were the department with a stricter enforcement on it. For a first job, I would say it treated me well."
good,"Decent pay, fast paced, and really requires a little drive to be the top man, but its achievable. The opportunities for promotion are given to everyone openly as long as they fit the guidelines."
good,"driving is a passion for me, I have great experience in firefighting and fire prevention."
good,IThe most enjoyable part of this job is that you get to do different functions depending on how hard you work and the willingness to get trained in different areas.
good,"Amazon is a family friendly place to work. The people there are nice people, and they are willing to help you with any questions you may have. I highly recommend this job."
good,"I worked from home, so they would try and make it so your experience as an employee was enjoyable. Plus the leadership there is a fantastic group of people because it is all about the customer and not just making money."
good,Amazon is a very great job it pays good in have very good benefits it's a good workout every day you got to work you meet a whole lot of new people all types of people
good,Amazon is a exciting place to work it's big so u have a lot to do. What I learned was who to stay on a steady rate while I'm on the job also to be more productive in my work. The management at Amazon is very helpful and always there to keep you focus and moving constantly. The work is fun and easy. I think it's enjoyable in so many ways. But I found the hardest part about this was staying positive about the job you are doing. But I enjoyed the people and keeping customer's happy.
good,"Excellent management. Easy non physically taxing work. Great coworker, and plenty of incentives to be the best at your job. plenty of opportunities to advance within the company"
good,Great management and training provided at amazon warehouses. Great salary and benefits as well. Although the work is not easy - show your best and you'll be spotted and rewarded!
good,"The staff and new friends made in Amazon warehouse was incredible! Lifting boxes helped me tremendously in regards to health. I was overweight when I started working for them in September, but by time I was laid off in December, 3 months later, I've lost so much fat off my body and feel amazing. Coworkers were very supportive and taught me so much about how to work effectively. The hardest part of the job was finding a manager to speak to when I needed clarification or assistance. Typical days went by fast because I enjoyed my time working. The benefits were great and enjoyable. The harder I worked, I was rewarded with benefits and that also kept me motivated to do the ultimate best of my ability."
good,I work for amazon fresh which is amazon's grocery store. I enjoy working here. I have nothing bad to say about amazon. They actually care about their employees. It's a fun work environment
good,It is a really good place to work. Learned a lot after working with people with different backgrounds and at the same time one of the few companies with an excellent work culture.
good,"Amazon.com is a good internet company to work for if you thrive in an environment that's fast paced, often innovating and experimenting, and very demanding of the human capacity to perform and be a resource for growth.  "
good,I work from home so it is great and I have a life and still able to do things while working for amazon. The pay could be better but nothing really else to say bad about this company they are doing great things
good,"This is the hardest part of the job where you got to go through bourgeos coding just to debug some stuff.not easy."
good,"A typical day is tedious and fast paced but a wonderful experience. You meet great people from all cultures and backgrounds and they do not discriminate. They are very open about when you work, but at the same time too many call-outs, excuses or overages/shortages and you gain point against you."
good,"Typical day at work is fun, learned how to use a Dora, management are helpful when faced with some difficult challenges, co-workers are easy to talk to also helpful if needed, wouldn't say there is a hard part to the job and getting to meet new people when dropping off parcels getting to know the customer so if there not avalable I could always complete my drops some way or another"
good,"Amazon is a great company to work with.After I graduated from college , Amazon gave me a great exposure to the corporate culture. I've learnt a lot about the importance of databases. I've always wanted to learn more about it and then I decided and came to the United states for pursuing my masters."
good,"it was fun working with amazon,as there is no work pressure and the people are amazing. the work culture makes you feel comfortable with your work"
good,I have learned a lot with Amazon. The co-workers are the best and it is a fun paced environment. I really love the fun they involve in the work days.

good,Nice place to work some times it gets really really busy but we have to get the job done so our customers can get there orders on time i learned alot working with amazon that how to manage alot team members traing them on safety and following statndard work procedure with fast pace envoirment. i like the mangement of amazon they are respectful they belive every associate will make a bg difference and they do. co workers are really nice vey friendly and comfartable work envoirment we all respect each other and belive in team work. i don't think that there is a hardest part as far as we have all the tools to perform our jobs and enough work force to get the job done.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon "
good,"Loved working there, management was an issue at times due to they would hire people with degrees who had no knowledge of the job for leadership roles so when a question was brought up even though the leader had been there for months wouldn't know how to handle it. but friendly environment  and all round great place to work."
good,"Work culture of the organization is great. Company provides great exposure to all its employees."
good,"It's the best company for a fresher to start his/her career."
good,"Amazon is a pretty easy job everyday,i scan the products with a hand held scanner and place it into a shelf location so that the product can be ordered by our customers. I learned to be problem oriented in the process. The managers are very understanding most of the time, and its a lot of employees that work at amazon so there's always someone to conversation with on breaks. i would say the hardest part about amazon is working the night shift, its easy to get tired,but after while the tiredness will pass, AND THE MOST ENJOYABLE PART  is the activities and the accuracy of your work."
good,Amazon was a great company to work for. There is plenty of work to keep you busy and if you do happen to find down time there are plenty of resources for you to learn more and/or try to apply within the company to another position. If you are a hard worker with a personable personality this would be a good fit.
good,"Advancement was great, I was able to reach the QA post with less than one year. Fun place to work. lot of opportunities however. salary is not that good."
good,I've got good experience on my previous job as delivery driver and I was learning a lot of tips like how to delivery focus and safe and how to drive quick and legal!
good,"There is no typical day at work at amazon some days you may be picking orders on busier schedules you may be cross training in other departments from goods out in the dock up to quality checking of goods. Ive learned a lot about perseverance and sticking at a task until you accomplish what you are doing to the best of your abilities. The management are great and supportive and feedback is daily on your performance so you will find out each day where your strengths are and where you maybe need a bit more support which is available through the the excellent coaching staff. Help is always at hand if you need it. Everyone works hard at amazon but the canteen and breakout areas are a fun place to get to know your co workers there are pool tables, table tennis amongst other things in the break areas which is not something ive seen in many other firms. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the rapidly changing pace of the work which may mean you have to train in a new department at short notice if required but everything is achievable through the first class support. There is always a team leader on hand to help out. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling you are part of a team that look out for one another you may spend a lot of time working alone but you are never on your own. All in all i would recommend working at amazon to anybody who was considering applying."
good,"Amazon is a place where we get opportunity to learn on new skills, communication skills and interact with customers directly to resolve their problems efficiently. The way of approach towards customer is very friendly. Productive and fun at work place."
good,A typical at work would be very fast paced and very fun. The hardest part of the job was doing a lot of team group work by yourself.
good,"Amazon was a great job. I learned that there is always someone there to help you and everyone is a team. Management really try their best to help you in anyway possible. There are signs all over the building to encourage you to keep going and the leads and managers will come to you personally to give you thanks. Although this job can be very draining and sometimes frustrating, the end result it always great."
good,"Amazon was my first job because they were the first to hire me. Although it may have been through SMX as a temporary employee, I felt that warehouse work was a great experience, especially here. Obviously the job would get tiring, but I felt it was personal progress for myself. Co-Workers and Supervisors were all friendly; they all worked hard."
good,I had a lot of fun working here the only thing was that I was only hired for the season and was not able to stay. One bad thing was that it was very repetitive.
good,"this place was really fun to work, I made a lot of new friends and they definelty made work easier. Also,the managment was kind and we had cool suprivisiors"
good,"Amazon was my first employer and it was great to be a part of the ""A to Z"" family. I was given opportunity to work with different teams which in turn helped me to learn more stuffs. Like, it gave me the platform to expertise myself in training, vendor management and testing."
good,"Working at the Amazon Fulfillment Center ONT-8 of Moreno Valley, I learned a lot of things, apart from already having had warehouse experience beforehand. I was allowed the opportunity to take safety classes, and also manage a small group of individuals. Overall, I did like working here, it was a great environment."
good,I loved working for Amazon and would consider doing so again in the future. The hardest part of the job was getting calls from customers that were already mad and trying to de-escalate the customer's complaint. We were given the freedom to use our own judgement to compensate for mistakes and missed deadlines.
good,A typical day is just scanning your badge and start youyr day on one end that needs help or that has bens open to store items. You must scan items according to bar codes and store them for pickers to get.
good,"While working for Amazon it is expected that every employee will always be working. There really is no downtime throughout the day. In addition, the day is very structured in regards to when breaks.lunch are to be taken. Managers are very strict on ensuring that employees take the required breaks."
good,"Working here taught me how to work at a very fast pace, gain disciple, become well-organized and provide customers assistance at a set time even though we couldn't interact with the customers face-to-face."
good,"Amazon has a terrific working environment, all of the employees are hands on and helpful. If you have a problem  at work there are people who are called problem solvers to assist you."
good,It not hard but very much a no stop going job. and very dirty. As well as you never really know who to go to for answers. it gets very tiring as well.
good,"Good pay, excellent carrier opportunities and benefits. Fast paced and exciting projects going on all the time. Employees taken care of."
good,I liked the job a lot there was plenty of room for advancement and the days went by quickly even when the work days are 10 hours.
good,Amazon is a really awesome place to work at. The benefits are great and the team are awesome. If your a work at home mom this would be the place for you with the Amazon family.
good,it is fun. long hours. a lot of people. if your work night shift you really don't have a life your life is work basically. good pay fun people amazing atmosphere
good,"Very fast paced environment. New goals everyday, so work is never the same. Culture is great and management is supportive. Be prepared to walk over 10 miles each day."
good,"I never have a dull day while working at Amazon. The typical work day begins with all teams of the same shift meeting for the before-shift meeting, Stand Up. At this meeting, the goals for the rate of stowers as well as how much product is being received is relayed to us. Working here has allowed me to learn how to think outside the box even more as I am a stower and must find ways to stow products quickly without violating bin etiquette. The managers routinely have friendly contests for us to participate in to give us even more of a driver to work quickly and efficiently. The experience I have had with my coworkers is one that I am unsure can ever be truly duplicated in that we find ways to surprise each other with jokes or stories about our weekend. The hardest part of the job would have to be moving around for 10 hours a night stowing products, but this also happens to be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Days at Amazon were tough and always fast moving, but you always stayed occupied and had a lot to do during those long days. I was placed on a variety of different jobs and tasks such as stowing, working on the dock, consolidation, and ICQA."
good,awesome company and awesome management..one of the best company I have ever worked with ..truly the best people and the best management..i regret leaving this company
good,"Management was perfect, they were understanding and handled everything with proper work ethics. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the long work days. The most enjoyable part about working for Amazon was the coworkers and managers encouraging you to do better, as well as helping you when you need assistance."
good,"Great management team! A typical day there would consist of a lot of work and very fast pace movements. I enjoyed the company because they are very organized, and have a really great motivated team. Its a huge corporation so of course you have hundreds of workers and a lot going on. However, what makes it a good work environment, is that they are really huge on safety and quality."
good,"AWS is a fantastic place to work. The culture is good overally. A typical day's work would include assisting users from 6 different companies with different issues and some out of your skill set. Hence you should be gifted in troubleshooting skills and looking for information."
good,"Great place to work, many cultures in the company chances to stage up in positions are high many different job roles "
good,My co workers was very positive and full of energy and I really  like packing and stocking . Driving the order picker was very interesting something I never done there was always something new to look forward to.
good,"Everything within the company and warehouse is fine. However, in my opinion, the way they recruit people and how they release workers, is not very appropriate. Improvements should be made."
good,"En Amazon trabajas muchísimo, pero valoran tu trabajo y valoran las personas. Se hace el mejor posible para gestionar y coordinar el almacén teniendo en cuenta que se trata de una empresa con mas de 400 empleados trabajando y en constante desarrollo."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a fifteen minute start up where I view company update on current issues and events. Then I take calls throughout my 10 hour shift (4 days a week). During this time I have learned that positive positioning on bad experiences can make the world of change to a customer. The management here is outstanding overall. I would give them a 4 star rating just because there are a small handful of managers who don't really care about your success. They leave you out to dry for a lack of better words, but overall all of the management is outstanding, has your back and is easily approachable for knowledgeable advice. Coworkers are arguably the best asset to the company. Everyone is there to have fun, work hard and make history, something that the Amazon company greatly pushes and successfully accomplishes with fun events regularly. The most difficult part of the job would be positive positioning bad news when you know that the customer isn't going to be happy with the verdict. If you can get this down, you can gain satisfaction out of ""turning that frown upside down."" Hands down the most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of knowing that a customer is ecstatic with the experience they have endured with you on something that means everything to them both emotionally and physically."
good,I absolutely loved working and being a part of earth's most customer-centric company. Good work is quickly acknowledged and appreciated by the management. They provide more challenging work and bonuses to employees who perform well.
good,Seasonal Opportunity. A challenging and fun opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work would be finding new things to be picked."
good,Ake us to work in night shifts. Gives good pay with less technical experience. What I learnt at  amazon is to communicate to speak to learn. Overall a good company.
good,Good Job to work for if you like long hours and like working hard
good,Good place to work because it has great benefits and offer competitive pay
good,"> Good place"
good,Fun place to work But the only thing is walking all day you would be surprised how many miles you have walked that day.
good,"amazon fulfillment is among the best place. work week is 4 days only so work and life is balanced as you get more personal time. "
good,"long hours, good pay. the most enjoyable are the co-workers. and great compensation."
good,"I would day I really enjoyed working there, company is so caring towards their workers. I mean the company is famous about getting serious on the floor about employees health and safety measures. I felt this personally so I really enjoyed being a part of Amazon once in a life. The hardest part is that their shifts are for long period of time but at the same time its kind of fun because all the co-workers are so  nice to you that you didn't even realize of that hardest part sometimes."
good,"Good pay"
good,"Amazon.com was very Great experience, I was on my feet for 12 hrs a day and was always focused to get my work done on time. We had scanners that would time us ."
good,I love working in this fast steady paced job. doing daily inventory count while walking 12 miles daily.
good,"I counted and organized merchandise"
good,"It is just a temp service, no hard work, loved all my co-worker. The best thing about the job is that you get a chance to be hired on to amazon."
good,"I have been working in Amazon for almost 15 months now. Best part of working with Amazon is its 14 Leadership Principles & how my daily work and life revolves around it."
good,Une bonne école pour apprendre la stratégie logistique et offre plusieurs opportunités d'évolution.
good,"10 hours of work with two 10 min. breaks & one 30 min lunch. i learned to always keep your workplace clean & stay hard at work, Fun co workers, Fun managers, Strict cell phone policy, hardest part of the job was to switch different jobs every day, most enjoyable part i would say is learn all the postions inside of the warehouse."
good,"A typical day as a Lead coach is very exciting. We go in and go to stand ups ( every morning each locating ( packing, picking, stowing...etc) have a stand up there they tell us how we did the day before, what they expect for that day and we also stretch. Than everyone go to where they are suppose to go and I go and talk to all our associates and new introduce myself to new ones. Around 8;30 am we have a meeting and there we pass out deliverable s and talk about whats expected for that day. We than go and pass our deliverable s to our associates ( deliverable s are Point reviews, write us. proof of education, and Positives). Than we go ask managers for rates and work with those whose rates are very low and show them things so that they can make rate. Those whose rates are great we go and let them know and keep motivating them and ask if they need any help. After i am done w that i go and put information on computer and so on. I learn different things every day i mean we have all type of cultures working at amazon, i love how i can talk to different people and learn new things. My cow- workers ( HR team) are the best people ever and they are always wiling to help me in anything i need. The hardest part of my job is having to walk somebody out because of their rates. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to talk to everyone."
good,"- My most current workplace was such a fun and hard working environment where you get to meet new people and learn the fast pace of meeting targets set by the company. "
good,Great place to work. Just make sure to have a great pair of shoes because you do A LOT of walking. 20-25 miles a night to be exact.
good,"Been here for 3 and a half years learned every aspect of the fulfillment here and have learned greatly how it works, hardest part is the workload and it also is the best keeps you busy and active"
good,"Segunda"
good,"A typical day is stocking the bins so the Pickers can get the item for the customer. "
good,7 am-6 pm fast paced time went fast management was ok being yemporary u never new who was ur manager that day
good,a typical day at work was an 8 hour hard shift. i learned that if we work as a team we can get everything done quicker. the workers in there were pretty quiet as they just wanted to get the job done and go home. the hardest part of the job is having to work myself in an isle it made the time go so much slower. the best part of the job is getting payed at the end of every week.
good,It was a great company to work with. The management was good and  flexible too.
good,"Na Amazonas Importados, no cargo que eu exercia necessitava sempre de dinamismo, auto controle e resoluções rápidas, todos os dias de 8:00 hrs. ás vezes até 10 hrs. por dia sempre existia muito trabalho e problemas a serem solucionados, 70% do que SOU aprendi na empresa,  o espanhol, a administração, as compras nacionais e importados, trabalhar com sistema, elaborar estratégias, auditoria nas lojas e estoques......... O único chefe que eu tinha era o proprietário o qual é uma excelente pessoa e que respeita todos os funcionários. O dialogo e o respeito são essenciais dentro da empresa, tive a sorte de ter pessoas que sempre estiveram prontas a somar conosco, e dispostas a aprender cada vez mais. O sistema operacional da empresa infelizmente era parte mais difícil, o mesmo tinha falhas que acabava me dando informações imprecisas a respeito do estoque e consequentemente atrapalhava um pouco o meu  trabalho já que eu era a compradora da empresa, a parte mais agradável era os elogios recebidos dos clientes em relação as novidades compradas, a colaboração dos colegas, e a sensação do dever cumprido.   "
good,A typical day for me was greeting my coworkers and managers. Learning a new thing every week. I learned the process of how the trucks came through inbound. The process of receiving and decanting items off of pallets. I also learned how to stow items to library bins. My coworkers were really friendly and very welcoming. Hardest part was at the end of the day when my feet had enough of walking back and forth across the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job is the energy everyone had and how easy it was to get through the day.
good,"stand up and stretches,get assignments{different processes}to count items in bins, or for me,I would do audits on packing inbound,outbound,prep,after lunch, stand up stretches back to work.I've learned the distribution process through auditing and safety. Getting along with alot of people.management had an opendoor policy which benifited for associates,also some of them actually talk to you out on the floor.Working with alot of people had it's benifits,I'm one who gets along with anyone,you tend to meet all people, different backgrounds, cultures,different states or countries through transfer or other means.Keeping up with the rate was the hardest ,always upping the rate.Enjoying the auditing part was interesting to me,I feel I have a good eye for that part of the job. Management left me alone,because they knew it be completed at a certain time."
good,A typical day at work consumed of meeting at stand-up and getting our assingments then we stretch and start work. The management was very helpful and nice. The co-workers were nice and friendly. The hardest part about the job was trying to keep your rate up with limited space on shelfs. The most enjoyable part of work was getting to meet new people and making sure the customers got the right order and on time.
good,"If you like sitting around all day, answering calls, and helping solve customer complaints for (starting rate) 10.00 an hour this is the job for you.. The recently changed their New-Hire Training, they pretty much just teach you how to use different computer programs to look up everything you need. This isn't a good job for you if you don't know how to navigate between multiple tabs. Management is overly-friendly, which is great if you need help there is someone there to lean on. They have potlucks all the time, they also have multiple break rooms which are great. There is a quiet room, which is a room where your not allowed to talk and they have a pretty decent sized library. They also have a Game room, which has a Foosball Table, a TV, Pool Table, and Corn Hole. (these were the only two I went to.) They also have a pretty big lunch area, that offers free popcorn, tea, coffee, and hot cocoa to all employees! There is multiple fridges, toaster ovens, and microwaves. There is also a bunch of tables to eat from, multiple TV's, Computers (for personal use), and a couch. You get two paid 15 minute breaks, and an hour lunch (unpaid) but you can get that switched to 30 minutes if you wish. If you can handle angry customers and sitting in a cubical all day this is the job for you."
good,"I would love to work there again, its a great job. During a work day i start off by picking items to be shipped. I got faster and a lot better at picking my orders over the time i had. Although i never had a face to face interaction with any of the managers but based on the work place management was outstanding. I only got to meat with co workers during our lunch. the work hours would have to be the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable is the compensation."
good,Meiner Meinung nach ist Amazon einer der besten Arbeitgeber in Berlin.
good,Amazon is a great place to work in and the training is awesome hands on. The people and managers are a very great help . They work with you if you need help. And there's always work . The bad thing about it is that there should be fans near the stowing areas .
good,"Work at a cubicle for 8 hour day, taking phone calls assisting with customer accounts and orders (how to place one, arrived late, broken, incomplete or not at all, refunds, replacements, etc.)"
good,tell us our goals for the night and encourage us to reach them and send us to work.
good,"Great company for growth within the company/organization. "
good,The job is fast-paced. It can be hard sometimes but you will get used to it. They prioritize safety and customer experience. Management and coworkers are great.
good,"Was comforatble and Happy Working with an Organization Like Amazon."
good,It’s a very physical job and they pay is worth the work you do. Just need better management in my opinion and needs to work on the hr workers. Overall good company
good,"typical day at work would be, pick up a scanner and sign in, clock in and go to a meeting point, every morning we have a quick breath, then we get to our work floor and start working, the only thing i could say to anyone who will start this job would be, make sure you have comfortable shoes for work, and be prepared for long hours"
good,Mi experiencia en esta empresa fue muy buena desde el punto de vista económico y aún mayor desde el enfoque laboral.
good,"Highly goal oriented organization. Amazon is very concerned with the wellbeing of the employees hence they created a safe environment to work."
good,"They work at a steady pace, Amazon wants each and every item that’s been ordered to get out the building in good condition and packed, ready to be shipped off. Amazon loves when workers work together because it gets the job done much faster and at a very great pace"
good,Great company to work for however had on manager that did not like me because I was white. Was never corrected by management. I ultimately left the company
good,"The only cons about the location I work at is 1 they didn't even have my badge for me even though I had my picture taken at the hiring event. 2 the person that's the head of the order is rude, they kept their headphones in an had an attitude when one of my coworkers asked where they could find an item, after I saw that I didn't want even want to ask for help from them. But overall, it's a good work environment, the workers at the market were nice enough to greet me."
good,All establishments have places to be worked on but so far this one is doing great. I work there for a short period of time only because i was expecting and i was getting closer to my due date .
good,management are so supportive. work shifts are so flexible. provided us an on job training and the trainers were so helpful. colleagues work around and are more supportive and fun work place.
good,"it was fast paced but yet well managed. every day was productive. "
good,"Was great. I loved it I had no problem,  only thing was they should get done if their warehouses more attention because they ate board on who they promote."
good,Bonne expérience mais rythme de travail très lourd il faut pouvoir s’adapter.
good,Good work place and very good working culture. They given a great opportunity to train other colleague. The most enjoyable part is to do photorealistic product. Feeling happy to be part of amazon.
good,"I am unfortunately facing a layoff, due to a loss of a contract, in a few years. I am saddened to be leaving the company as I have had an amazing 2 years with them. One of the best employers, by far. I have had a great manager and amazing colleagues and couldn't be more grateful for the experiences I've had. They have provided me with an excellent work/life balance, great benefits and many laughs along the way. The only con would have to be that in working in different cities far from home, we wouldn't get a lot of face-to-face time, as a team."
good,Great place to work if you want a job that is faster paced and keeps you busy not for people who want to stand around and socialize. Amazon is easy work if you are someone that has strong work ethics and don’t believe you are owed something for nothing
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo dan te gratis café palomitas , buenos compañeros excelentes jefes recuerdos muy hermosos , deje grandes amigas el training indescriptible lloramos nos conocimos sin palabras mas que amigos deje hermanos."
good,"managers are nice and most of the people are friendly. A lot of packages that need to be scanned and delivered. good work and life balance, good benefits."
good,Very good job if you can stand and lift for long periods of time. You will need to watch you upt time if you go over what they give you for the year you will be terminated.  Other then that it is not a bad work environment.
good,"Was a nice experience but not for long due to not busy period they had to let me go , its a good environment overall ! They have good trainers and nice canteen!"
good,"The work was decent. The management was accommodating and for the most part trying to make things work. "
good,"It is hard work, on your feet 10 hrs a day but it's worth it for the great benefits. You always have something to do. Management is great, very helpful."
good,"Productive and fun place with arcade. Only down side is the location far away distance from me. A typical day there is pretty chill and good vibe. the most enjoyable part is working there, such a refreshing clean place."
good,"Your role, the management, the environment, the interaction, is all great, simple, and easy at amazon. Only complaints is that I didn’t get paid for my 3 first days when training, and compensation isn’t as well as you’d expect for continuous manual labor for 6-8 hours on end."
good,"Hard work when sorting different sizes of parcels but very good atmosphere among colleagues.  Lack of air conditioning is very annoying on hot days but they give away ice cream during work😁 There is air conditioning in the canteen.  In addition, they organize various other attractions (cartoonist doing portraits, free lunches, competitions, etc.). It is a pity that the contracts were only for 9 months."
good,The hours can sometimes be too harsh also a really laid back job. Even though the females at Amazon can have a crazy attitude the job is fair itself..
good,i find a co worker badge on the floor and i bring it to the HR from there i feel out a form of finding  iteme on work zone can prove wasn't a stolent iteme
good,"I've learned to scan packages to the right pallets and plastic wrapped those pallets, I did face sort, inbound, small sort, etc.  It was a fun place to be accept for the issues with Access Link.  I was late a few to a couple of times."
good,"i love working there. you are in charge of you own schedule, the conditions are good. people are sometimes respectful, understandable. being a flex partner makes me manage my time very well."
good,"A day at work consists of non stop order fulfillment. If you work there for over a month they begin training you in different areas and giving you more responsibility. Management is very civil and friendly as long as you are not caught talking our being unproductive too often. For the hard workers and ones who seek advancement and experience this is the place for you. They will give you opportunities and advancement at a very fast rate if you are willing to work for it. For people who are living paycheck to paycheck this is not for for you. They will push you to see results and as such, most people quit within their first month or two."
good,"l’entreprise elle est  agréable,  elle gère biens ses salaries et  sur tous elle est respecte les règlement ."
good,"On a normal wok day, the volume is more then 100K, items getting delivered from Amazon LTN4."
good,"This place got a lot of flack around the time I got started. Honestly don't see what the big problem was. Managers/Supervisors were nice and helpful. The workplace was fast paced and some said the numbers were hard to hit but I was seeing senior citizen hitting the numbers like it was nothing. Only real issue I could have seen really a problem with was issues with food trucks, time off task was obscenely hard to do with bathroom breaks, took forever just to initiate a break with checkpoints (that process almost made it seem prison'ish. Not sure if it changed for the worse or better but was definitely going a better direction by the time I left there."
good,"The workplace culture, the management and the allowances given by the company for every associate are all wonderful. In my current role, I am responsible for managing network volumes, monitor variance, reports daily traffic volumes, headcount analysis, capacity plans, call volume and staffing trends and made recommendations to planning function. The core. While the above is what I execute on a day to day."
good,"Best  environment to work "
good,I love Amazon this is a great company to work for . Amazon care about their employees.We have stand up meeting two times a day to discuss any problems and any mistakes we are making .
good,I feel that it is a great place  to work friendly people I do feel the there should be better training and entry level should work on the standing on your feet for 10 hr shifts.
good,"most enjoyable is the engaging managers and team members"
good,Casual job that requires a special personality that could really light up a customers experience. Every worker was more than willing to assist customers resolve any issue.
good,Feel lucky and proud to be a part of Amazon. Wonderful management with best culture. The hardest part was to leave the company for personal reasons...:(
good,I'm a motivated person with a lot of goals and dreams I never give up on my ability to go for more. I have strong faith and I always do my best to set up and accomplish my goals.
good,Un environnement et mode de travail très bien conçus et très agréables.
good,"My typical day at the workplace was simply working at a fast paste so we can make rate. I learned that the Job Amazon is a very challenging environment to work in but it keeps you busy and also in great shape. The managers there were very lay back. Sometimes though they would give us trouble for not picking up the paste. But as long as employees there did what they were supposed to do, they were not hard to get along with. The Workplace culture was pretty simple. It did not matter what race or religion you were. They treated everyone equal. The most difficult thing about the Job is the pressure they would put on employers. For instance,  working your hardest but it is not good enough for them. The most enjoyable about the Job was the managers did show their appreciation to their employers. They would have Pizza in the break area for us. Or Hot Dogs and pretzels. Also the scratch off prizes they would have for us as well."
good,Good job for no experience people & good benefits people are really nice always making you feel comfortable and basically care for you. I like that your voice/opinion is being heard.
good,"Working here gave me a sense of security between job, the people were nice and it was a fun place to work, I learn what really goes on  when you order form Amazon."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, I learned to record and insert the expiration date of the products in the system. I resolve the problem of missing label on the items, and made the inventory of the item by counting and scanning all items in the bin. This the work in my department. Sometime, I picked the items for the customer even it is not my department, but sometime my PA sent me there to help respond to the order of the customer."
good,"Amazon was a really good way to get in a exercise, everybody was working at a fast pace sometimes it gets stressful when all the orders get messsed or or something happens but other than that everybody worked together"
good,It was very fast paced job. You had to keep up to make your quota of the day.  You have to follow instructions and pay attention. Just gotta keep going and it’s pretty easy.
good,Wonderful place to work. Great work/life balance. Great culture. Everyone treats each other with respect. Would definitely recommend amazon as a great place to be employed.
good,i loved working for amazon people were very friendly and the staff was very helpful and a day at work if nothing was broken just consisted of walking the building and looking for potential issues
good,"Working at Amazon, I enjoyed the fast-paced environment as it made the day go by fast. I learned a new set of skills in regards to warehouse work like loading and unloading freight, scanning and labeling merchandise, and organizing cargo."
good,"I loved working at Amazon. It was fun fast-paced, time went by fast due to all the work that needed to be done. I have no complaints. Thank you for the opportunity."
good,"This job is perfect for a fast paced worker who loves a challenge. The schedules are nice, normally working 4 ten hour shifts and three days off. Pay is okay starting off. A typical day is always productive and mostly routine. I've learned a great deal about the process in which ordered products are being delivered to satisfy the customers needs. Management is always very helpful and respectful with any questions or anything an employee might need. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with your rates at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with new people everyday and getting trained in new departments."
good,A place where your safety came first is A good place to work.coworkers work as a team do not disciminate against you for nothing. is a fun place i recomend it
good,Started working at amazon as a picker and quickly learned other job duties such as packing. Managment was great I recommend working here and sticking to the company. If I did not have to relocate to a different state I know I would grow with this company.
good,"Amazon is a really good place to work.  Work hours have changed a lot recently, limiting current employees at the particular location to not having access to the hours they previously had. I find there is a great employee culture where people genuinely enjoy coming and working hard and interacting with others. The break room allows for employees to eat, talk, interact, watch television and relax during break times and sit between shifts while awaiting the start of their next shift. I have applied some of my skills in the sortation position that I believe are positive and productive. I learn everyday to be aware and safe. I think if the hours needed were still available, which consists of at lest 29.5 hours weekly, most people would consider this to be the ideal employer."
good,I really enjoyed my time with Amazon. It is a very fun place to work. Management and co-worker are great and knew their jobs and had no problem doing them
good,"Working at Amazon was a pleasant experience. While management was forever changing in attempts toget the most out of employee output, the core job was easily learned. There were many outlets for advancement and the working environment was a welcoming one. An ideal place to stay for one paying off student loans or in a rut for cash but not for someone who is transitioning from place to place."
good,"very nice clean, calm work environment. lots of over time for a good paycheck. lots of things to do in your free time such as, wii, lounges,"
good,A typical work day was good depending on how the you feel. I've learned that you can gain alot and new work ethics when it comes to working hard. the management at amazon was decent they check up on you and make sure your good. I can honestly say the hardest part about working at amazon doing a full time shift is that you can and probably will be very tired with strong legs at the end of your shift lol. But the best part about working at amazon was the breaks lol they do give nice breaks.
good,Overall it was a good place to work good people to work with as far as co workers just gotta be very fast with everything to get the orders out to the customers
good,"I love to walk fast and think puzzle how to put boxes on the pallets. Put boxes on the pallets build up to 6 or 7 ft tall. Then shipped. Its fun. When you finish homework, you feel good for work so hard. Same when I finish boxes and packages off the conveyors, I felt good and happy. Proud of our self. I learned sort system how boxes and packages sent to different cities or states. My hardest work is cant call for help. Sometime manager put me work alone. When conveyors full of boxes and packages, got jam. System stopped.  Its hard for me some get help. This job is challenge. Say I want work Amazon Fulfillment again. Amazon is good job for not stand too long. Lot walking. Workers and few leaders easy bond as like family. Everybody love having teamwork at Amazon."
good,Overall it was a positive work experience. Very detailed work  and customer obsessed in a fast pace environment. Management was willing to train and had plenty of chances to advance.
good,Le travail chez amazone est un travail collectifs mais aussi individuels avec une bonne ambiance au seins du groupe.
good,A typical day at work was fasted paced always moving learning new things I learned how to check for damaged items and missing items umm management was ok very busy but helped when they can workplace culture was good the hardest part of my job was getting to B area to A area with out clocking out in time for lunch the most enjoyable part of the job is making friends and meeting new people
good,A typical day working for this company consist of preparing orders for shipment in a timely manner to meet customers satisfaction while maintaining a clean/safe work environment. Working for this company I've learned how to use different work strategies to help complete the task in a timely manner without disobeying any safety rules. The management is excellent and very helpful. The hardest part of the job to me is trying to exit the parking lot when the shift is done. Overall the most enjoyable part of the job to me would be learning to perfect certain task that i didn't know how to do before.
good,Empresa tenha como objetivo focar em seus funcionários para crescerem como profissional e dar resultados da empresa.
good,Amazon is very fast paced and we are always learning. This is a work from home customer service position in which you are required to keep up with the usual call center metrics. You must be customer focused and customer obsessed on your calls. There are so many different departments and specialty departments to work in. The company is always working on new and exciting projects. Amazon also offers great benefits and great rewards based on performance. The managers and team leaders are very supportive and will help you with your growth at Amazon. Amazon is a very fun place to work. I am happy with the company.
good,A typical work day is full of receiving items and learning the important process of making sure they get to the right destination. Management is always available when you need them.  A very friendly environment with a diverse group of co-workers. I would say that the hardest part of the job is the constant standing and the most enjoyable part of the job is challenging yourself to receive as many items as you can by the end of the day that contributes to meeting or exceeding the volume plan.
good,"I loved working here, if I could go back, I would in a heartbeat. The managers and other leaders at the facility are very very engaging and helpful. Great place to work if you are looking for a second job."
good,Love the hours.  Scheduling is very accurate.  The atmosphere is great.  Motivated people with high energy. Very professional service and the recruters are awesome.
good,"Great place to work, time go so fast, good benefits and nice enviroment. Coworkers always ready to help. Very secure and clean, lots of overtime and good schedule"
good,"Amazon Customer Service is #1 in the world for a reason; The people are amazing. Not only are they great, but they provide a healthy and happy atmosphere that makes you want to come into work every single day. In Logistics, you get to interact with drivers and customer all around the country and it is a great department where you can grow your talents and further the company's success as well. You will LOVE it :)"
good,"Always be on your toes be aware of your surroundings and make sure you have everything u need "
good,William botz is on of the best managers ive ever had he maivates me to do better and is a great role model for the company I think he should become more than leadership.
good,Product give and fun had awesome supervisor s. Love being a bleed to w peek on my own speed. Allowed to take to short breaks during your shift. Omer allowed to make 4 or five hours a shift
good,"Not a bad place to work. easy to get hired. and very fast paced. but Amazon hires way too many people."
good,Amazon is the best place to work with tension free. No micro management. And no one will force to work or anything. love the working environment. Kudoos for amazon culture.
good,"I enjoyed working for amazon. But, I live in laurens sc and driving an hour to and from work started to drain me. Working for amazon is a great opportunity."
good,Amazon is a great place to get a start in working and have fun while getting paid. Fast paced and can learn different jobs to do. Everyone gets along.
good,"I am a current employee at one of the Amazon Fulfillment Centers. I enjoy the fast-paced yet fun environment. During my time here, I have developed new leadership and communication skills. I  enjoy the variety of co-workers who I have met through this company. All of the Managers in the facility are very informative and helpful. What I enjoy most about this job is the flexible scheduling, and constant opportunities it provides for growth."
good,Great place to work for. virtually it is okay but depends on the individual. Stock options are great. and pay is decent but customer service is a burn out job.
good,"I didn't enjoy working the schedule that I was assigned, but when at work, I was able to work in a stress free environment and enjoy the management team and coworkers. Received various cross training to allow me to spread my horizons across different departments."
good,"Enter picking, packing and loading information into the predefined amazon database. Report any errors in product selection and quantity to the supervisor immediately."
good,I would love to stay but the commute is exhausting especially when it is over 200$ just in gas. I appreciate the job since it is very fast paced and I always have something to do.
good,"A typical day at work is going in for your scheduled 10 hour shift and picking over 1,000 items that day. I learned that working long hours can help keep you a balanced person on and off the job site. In my opinion, management at Amazon is very poor, but I believe it's because the amount of workers there are. The co-workers are from so many different cultures and it helps you learn something new day in and day out. The hardest part of my job was walking 10 hours a day. I think the most enjoyable part about Amazon is how fast paced it is."
good,"Typical day at work consists of high volume workloads and fat pace expectations. You learn to time manage while working at Amazon but luckily there is always a goal for each employee to accomplish which helps you want to do better daily."
good,"AfricFarm market Limited is a food import business located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I was responsible for making arrangement for merchandise overseas. I was also responsible to clear the merchandise from the U.S. Customs. Sometimes, I will helped with the distribution of the food products to our various warehouses and grocers nationwide in the US."
good,Great working environment but limited growth opportunities. Very busy around the holidays but very slow other times. Great place to work if you are student. Great benefits and especially fro students.
good,The people are very social and so is the management. When it comes down to business they also help the employees that are either struggling or are not fit for the position. Overall it is aa great place for money benefits and experience.
good,The typical day at Amazon is slow and steady. I've learned a lot on how to prep items to be able to send them out to customers. The management is great and so are the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the very long breaks we have to wait forever on and when they send us home because there is nothing else for us to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with all my co-workers and conversating with the managers and just enjoying the day while we work.
good,If you have never worked in a warehouse before. This is a great place to start. Mangers are very kind and always willing to help you.
good,Amazon worked as one of there many shipping facilities. It has a very clean environment and a very encouraging staff (always promoting success and fun). the biggest issue I've seen with amazon would have been the massive layoff in 2015 where they let go of about 3000 people in under a month.
good,"fast pace, team player,  reliable. great team work great trainers. easy to catch on. hardest part about the job is working 12 hour shifts breaks go by really fast. parking suck during peak time. learning how to work at a fast pace was a interesting experience."
good,"journée de travail physique mai supportable"
good,I found that amazon had great support and assistants and was well trained.I learnt how to keep a good productivity up. The co-workers there were friendly and supportive.The morning getting into the routine .
good,"a very good job exposure and valuable resources"
good,Amazon is a growing company that understands not only customer satisfaction but also employee satisfaction. They care about their employees more than any company I've worked for which is a very good thing because its hard to run a company without your employees being happy.
good,A typical day at work consisted of 10 hours. The work environment was very fast paced and we had to work at a certain rate to get the job done. I learned to work with people of different ethnics. The managament was very good. My coworkers were fun and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working in such a big facilty. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people
good,Every day is a new experience. It is fun working with so many different people. I love the interaction with all of my co-workers and managers.
good,"Day at Amazon starts with a list of your task to be completed at EOD. You are required to communicate with many people irrespective of your department which is very helpful. Your co-workers are very helpful and supportive."
good,"If you go through integrity staffing keep in mind when you get to Amazon the days will be different."
good,"Amazon Aço uma empresa com um ambiente ótimo de trabalho,funcionários maravilhosos,uma segunda casa,uma empresa comprometida com sua imagem e bem estar de seus empregados e clientes."
good,"From free nerf guns to going home at 5pm, as a contractor I had the best of both worlds at Amazon. Some full time employees had to work nightmare shifts until midnight when *@& hit the fan, but I was able to work hard 9-5 and ensure that I was a successful member of the team."
good,"Benefits and the environment is great, there are a lot of oppertunities."
good,"A typical day at Amazon would be a day of counting, and making sure you're back from your breaks on time or you would get in trouble. If you ask me it felt like high school all over again because they stayed on you as if they was principals."
good,"working 10/4 a lot of overtime offered, learned packing, picking ,administrative and Payroll."
good,"this job is great for NEW to the workplace employees, they give you a chance to make something of yourself and you get paid great for it!"
good,It was a nice place to work everyone spoken to everyone.That first it was hard because it was so busy and i didn't know what to do but in the end it got so much easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new mates.
good,At amazon.com you are busy most of the time you really dont get to spend time with co-workers since it is mostly independent work.
good,I like to lear more about the company every day. Move frequently I think it help people grow and the company too. New experience it help grow and have new knowledge about other things.
good,It was a good company to work for. The manager was a great people person and very respectful. Employees were also great to work with and very helpful.
good,The hours are extensive. I recommend investing in some comfy sneakers that you wouldn’t mind getting a little dusty. The managers are very helpful and informative.
good,"Worked part time at a sortation center for 3+ years. It was a great place, I met many great people, and the work is pretty easy, although it was very physical. Most coworkers work hard, but there's always a couple that slow us down and expect other people to pick up their slack. As long as you do your role, no one bothers you. Breakrooms were huge and they had a wide selection of snacks and food for their market. The hours for part time were very inconsistent, ranging from 15 hours to sometimes 40+. I would totally work here again if they had better hours."
good,"It’s a good experience , flexible hours, good pay and friendly environment. Different positions to choose from and different locations with good benefits"
good,It was just to over whelming The company is filled with great people who want to help you learn and build your career. A lot of opportunities to sit in on meetings and get involved in projects.
good,"Amazon is great at working hours to suit your schedule. It's very fast paced. If you work it as a workout, it's awesome! "
good,They are a good company I just wish they would care more about their employees. I also wish they would pay them more because they work hard and I think it’s unfair how little they are paid
good,Amazing huge warehouse full of love happiness and professionally clean neat environment teamwork loving team members Superviors awesome GOOD JOB AMAZON
good,Very easy job great place to work good benefits and a good pay you never work the same position you switch daily and management is easy to get along with
good,Le seul de désavantage pour moi était le trajet et l’avantage était la facilité que j’avais au travail
good,"Great place to work. My daily duties were Process, package and ship orders accurately."
good,I enjoyed my time there.It was a convenient and good working environment. Worked with amazing team and they made my stay comfortable and worthwhile. Will highly recommend.
good,"Good communication "
good,"Everything about this job is amazing. There is absolute flexibility on hours and days worked. The company’s progressive policies are aggressively being utilized to make the company better every day. Non-gender specific bathrooms, a community wall where managers will listen to and help employees, accommodations such as water and utilities supplied to employees for efficient work."
good,"Great place to work Temporary position but very fun environment, worked as a staffing coordinator and went to job fairs and colleges to recruit new potential employees"
good,"It's an amazing place to work. Work and fun at work motivates you to come to work everyday. Management is amazing. Also, Was paid really good for overtime. Benefits- medical insurance, transport, sodexo, shares"
good,I loved working for amazon.. They have great hours and pay and the job is fairly easy.. I was always busy and that made the 12 hour shifts go by quickly..
good,"I learned how to build pallets, communicate with me people, it’s a hard work environment but you just got to stay positive, the managers will always check up on you"
good,Great pay and job for part time employment. Great management and great hours. I would recommend working in a fullfillment center if someone was in need of a second job.
good,Amazon is known for a corporate culture that pushes employees to explore ideas and take risks. This cultural condition is responsible for the company’s capacity to seek new opportunities to utilize data-intensive processes to provide efficient online retail service.
good,"What I would do every day at amazon..."
good,It was a fun place to work fast pace. Nice people to work with and Managers great people. Amazon gave prizes about twice a month. Lots of walking you need good shoes.
good,It’s pretty easy to apply for. The jobs are great and they have great benefits. Whatever job you are looking for I’m pretty sure you will find it on here.
good,They had open schedules every time I chose one it was denied or was told I was no longer available and they wouldn’t change my schedule so I resigned and was only able to come back as part time.
good,laid back environment. No supervisor hoovering over you every minute. Jobs are easy to perform. Benefits are great! They feed you on the holidays sometimes they feed you for no reason which is a plus and its a very diverse place to work
good,The workplace culture is great. I often experience a heavy workload but am also given flexibility in my day to balance my personal life. Great management.
good,It’s a good company to work for they’re pay associates $15/hr now and I would honestly say it’s definitely a great place to work for if you are looking for a long term career.
good,I picked up on how things went quickly. Started moving up quickly and work multiple departments. I really enjoyed being there. Over night shift was the best to me.
good,It's a  wondrful job to have work for I will recommend this job to anyone you will make the money you wantto make it's truly a excellent company to work for I love what I do as a customer service rep I love helping people what their needs
good,It cool place to work at hard to make friends there an pick there  if. Manger like u u go longer u make.  Some got. Night class there college in warehouse
good,"Very Good experience would work here again "
good,"great company to work for, independence, internal customer and external customer attention, great place to gain growth and experience.Managers always give attention and love new ideas."
good,"Working at Amazon is like all parts in a car everything have to be working together to get to the common goal for the shift."
good,Great company and family environment. Always warm and welcoming and the growth opportunities are great. From the minute you start until the minute you leave its a great energy
good,I drove an order picker and stored items. You need to the different bins and isles in order to store the packages. Some boxes are extremely heavy and you would need to store them. You would be going 25ft in the air with the order picker. It is safe because there are harness and cranes holding you just in case. The company is run by great people with time to stretch and talk about jobs duties every time you get to and back to work.
good,Amazon is a job you want if you can work at a quick paced every week. Everyone is friendly and you can managed to do anything if you just ask someone to teach you.
good,"Amazon was a great place to work everyone was friendly , the pay was great for what we had to do , if i ever moved back to california i would love tk go back to amazon ."
good,There 10 to 15 minutes and the break room is all the way in the corner of the building so you have to walk from where you're at which is at the other side of the building all the way to the cafeteria! By the time you got there to your break room break was already over. It was horrible they need to make breaks a little bit longer so you can walk to and from back
good,"working sorting in the warehouse could sometimes be overwhelming, but the pay was fair and you get a good workout. because of my physical constraints i was not able to continue in this role and they were reasonable in accommodating me with a different role"
good,Job is not that hard. I work in C-Returns. Inspecting returns that the customers send back to make sell able or refurbish. Work with a great set of people and we all get along.
good,Very nice facility to work at Staffing management was okay good benefits good pay Safety Management took care of all needs that need to be met and update us or safety every chance they got
good,you learn so much its fun the people are cool and you get to pick pack and shop around for customers i highly recommend  amazon for a part time job for extra cash
good,"I Actually Liked Working For Amazon. It Was Cool, Independent Work. Bi-Weekly Pay. The Pay Also Was very Nice. Only Thing I Didn't Like Was Having To Pick My Hours!"
good,it was a good job and easy but managers changed shift times and made it difficult to work around school even with school accommodation. mangers are laid back and get switched out a lot.
good,"They treat their Seattle employees so well! Excellent benefits, amazing work area and offices. You can take your dog to work. Crazy parties and luncheons that are paid for. However, I felt like a negative COG in the wheel of global capitalism."
good,"Good work environment, best support from management, good transport facility, best team work, best trainjng programs,  good incentive plan for employees."
good,Great Company. I enjoyed working at Amazon but the hours/shift became a bit too much as I was required to work over night shifts. The transport is great as well as the salary.
good,"good company, I have really good experience in Amazon Campus team. Every colleague is very friendly and willing to help you. In addition, the salary is really competitive in Seattle. Highly recommended."
good,If you are to work at amazon you should be in good shape. most jobs there require you to walk 50+ miles a sift. the pay was great for the work you had to do. while I was there I learned how to interact with coworkers.
good,at amazon every day was exiciting because they give you a chance to learn new things everyday and the work keep you busy.i learned that a lot can be accomplished with the help of a team.
good,My typical day at work is pretty relaxed and smooth. I like working i enjoy getting up and meeting new people. The hardest part of the job is making easy mistakes.
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, but you have to be mentally &' physically prepared. You make good money, &' you're guranteed 40 hours a week; 4 days of work, &' 3 days off."
good,"First of all , i would like to talk about the job environment. It was really fast paced and a challenge. I felt really safe working here and the staff was really friendly"
good,Great Company to be  apart of flexible hours and great pay . A company with room for growth and advancement. In my month of working for Amazon i've moved up and recievd pay increase
good,"We would start off our day by stretching and going over our daily goals. Next we would proceed to pick the item our scanner have read for us on the screen. The fun part was when we got back from break whoever pick the most item in 30 mins will receive a small prize such as gift cards, hats , sunglass etc."
good,Amazon is a great company to work with. I worked as customer support associate for India emails where we used to respond to customers for their order/refund/return queries.
good,At work you would clock in and stretch; the whole company was about the safety of their workers and the environment around. The facility had fans located all around and made the work experience pleasant while fast paced and motivated by possible rewards.
good,"during my time at amazon, i was promoted in 6 months. hard work gets you far, and they love to promote from within. the culture is unmatched in the job force, and management is also."
good,"i  like to do work and enjoy full with working with u an movement of my lif to give a place to my selfe to do work hard and from my heart warm to to work this job thankyou & "
good,It was a very energetic place to work at. I loved my coworkers and how helpful they were. I would definitely go back there if I had a chance . I enjoyed my job description it was very active.
good,"While working for atmosphere I enjoyed the diversity of culture that ran throughout the building, everyone was aloud to express themselves as they saw fit and it made the whole place feel more welcoming. Although at times the customers can be apart of the cons of the job, there wasn't anything that stuck out as unfair or biased. I would recommend working here to anyone."
good,"Amazon is a great company to grow with. They have great benefits, gives you shares of stock after 2 years of working with the company, and offer career classes."
good,"I start to get my paper work in order and start pulling orders so that we can pack and shipped them to the customers and I learned how to drive a pallet jack, order picker, and a stock chaser. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting the product to the customer and making them happy."
good,I liked being the safety specialist for amazon it has taught me how to take care of a warehouse to keep the associates safe
good,"The average day at amazon was very stressful, management team never communicates with employees. The hardest part of my job was going and doing my best and always being criticized."
good,"Challenging job can be demanding, co workers a lot of gossiping, hardest part of job making quota for the day, learned management skills and how to deal with different personalities in hiring process"
good,"I currently work at the Amazon in Shepherdsville, Kentucky and I don't think that it's a bad gig at all. It's an easy job and they're very flexible. You typically work 40 hours a week, but the opportunity for OT is almost always available if you want it. The benefits are great. If you ever go to management about an issue they genuinely care and do their best to find a solution. The only reason I'm rating it 4/5 is because the pay isn't all that great and the job itself (I'm a picker) is kind of monotaneous."
good,"- this job was definitely not for me."
good,Fun work place with helpful staff. Fast paced work environment. Lots of walking around and squatting. Learned how to use a scanner
good,Great place to work. I enjoy working for Amazon Distribution Center. The atmosphere is pleasant and they have great oppurtunities
good,"Now working in Amazon wasn't so bad and its really hard to get hired on as their standards are a little high but not unattainable. The managers and assistants consistently are aware of each worker and want to make sure of their well being, plus each work department is very simple, simply repetitive and the long hours that would get to you. Now working their may seem a bit like high school when it comes to break times, if you weren't the social butterfly then you were the loner and that in turn effects your outlook on the rest of the work period, so I recommend finding some work friends and when it comes to working, well it goes by very quickly, especially if you break it down by breaks compared to thinking the whole time frame. Overall they really look out for you, sure their are some cons but I found the pros more worth looking at."
good,"Amazon is a very undestanding company when it comes to their employees. The company will do their best to ensure the workers are in good care. Amazon has an on site health office, just in case someone has an accident. Since the job is so active, there are water stations all within the warehouse. Empoyees really get a great workout while working."
good,"Report to work at 6 am"
good,great opprotunitied just tooo far away..especially if you dont have a transportaion..but i loved the job
good,Bien  on apprend à travailler en équipe on nous explique plusieurs fonction au niveau du travail les poste so t bien et le travail aussi
good,"Ho imparato molte cose ,;ottima organizzazione dell,azienda"
good,I thought it was cool but it was boring just standing in he same spot for 12hrs or ore a day sucks I mean yeah the money was good but I felt like a slave
good,"no comment"
good,"Management was absolutely terrible and just about everything else. Truck drivers that didn’t even work there said it was terrible. That location is just all bad. Nothing more, nothing less"
good,They hire thugs off the streets. Please don’t waste your time. This place is not a good place for advancement. Managed never knows the answer to any questions
good,"J'ai aimé se travaille , qui ma beaucoup aidé dans ma vie personnelle."
good,"working at amazon provides one with excellent medical benefits.  they have a program called VTO (voluntary time off) where you can apply and be accepted to not have to go into work.  It's an ok place, the healthcare benefits cannot be beat."
good,The  management is horrible. The HR  department is hiring and firing which it should be the general manager or assistant  manager. Working for this company was OK until I found our hr run the company and no real  management does they don't go by the policy at all. They set their own rules and guidelines
good,"If you have a degree, don't start from the bottom. Nearly impossible to advance past a level 3."
good,never got paid on time  and in the end never got paid at all due to a supervisor in the company called prospect commercials amerzon it self was no help when we had a problenm
good,Hired on as a seasonal position driver no benefits no chance to move up the ladder and there is no way for a medical leave in case you have a medical emergency they deduct points or add points to you until you accumulate 13 and then let you go
good,i wouldn’t work their again. the environment isn’t clean and can be stressful on the daily basis. the managers are not helpful and the company will work you until your body can’t handle it.
good,"Could work better with employees "
good,I like what I use to do I was very fun always learing something new always wanted to go and the people good to work with the management there was ways helpful
good,Restock items daily and maintain rate. Keep on task and don't deviate from them is typically what that want you to do. Not much room for advancement only if your really really close with management then they give you a small chance to advance. Other than that if your looking just for a stop gap kind of employment then Amazon is the place.
good,"Not a very family orentated buisness, hard working drivers for the others "
good,Clocking day start off with exercises. A meeting about our Day. Go yo board to find my place.learn how to scanned and different items.pack. and.send items tor sale.I. am a hard worker with a smile that my manergers loved and co works.the hardest jobs was picking miles of walking.the most enjoyable time was earning employee high score.
good,good company salary and position ia quite normal.IJP should be conducted anf rewards should be given.overall company is best.I refer to work there......
good,"Standing on your feet all day. Shifts 8, 10, or 12 hors. No chairs on the floor. Required to stand. Packers, re-binners, and everyone else on the have intense goals. Packers = 250 boxes per hour"
good,"Parece que si vas a trabajar ,tienes que ir a divertirte y te presionan demasiado y no te valoran y encima parece que te estén salvando la vida ,mucha explotación"
good,Amazon It is a good working environment and I love working there cause it is lot off fun being working there.it is a very loving company and I love the owner off this company cause He started as a simple man and now he is one of the richest man in the word.
good,"I was not a part of the typical work culture. I was a contract delivery driver. I never really worked as a salaried employee. I had no benefits, 401k, vacation days, sick days. I never punched a time clock. It was not that type of job."
good,"I loved my job because of the people, but almost every shift is we work for three hours and have no break at all. :( This is my main reason to leave Amazon they want us to work with no break always and I find this disgusting."
good,its very fun to  work for amazon  until we get to dispatch and managers if they dont like you wont even get hours .management is real bad seems like they get paid to go flirt around and favoritism is one of there main problems this girls love the people to sit and lie to there faces all time when your a honest happy driver get packages delivered you gotta go cause ur too good and might take there spot .management gotta change they dont care for worker and dont help on anything but to bring you behind .
good,"Good benefits, good flexibility, other than that i do not have many good things to say about working for amazon. As a customer, Amazon is great, but as an associate not so much."
good,If you ever work for SNA4 Amazon Fullfillment Center be sure to manage your time and be aware of your surroundings and who you talk to just be yourself and do your job.
good,Managers need to do their jobs better but  overall very nice place to work. Love working in a fast pace environment and Amazon is the place to wrk at if you like fast past. Its friendly fun and fast.
good,"Great company but just like the military you cannot advance by staying in one location, there is no comfort zone you must be ready to step on other toes just to make an impact."
good,Blah ?? Blah?? Blah?? No job security. Never know when going to get laid off.Pay is not that good compare to other jobs. I would never work for them again.
good,"Aprendi coisas novas. Foi um grande desafio pra mim trabalhar nesta função, além do mais , meus superiores deram um grande apoio para que eu crescesse na função de assistente de estoque."
good,Empresa com poucos benefícios para o trabalhador. Porém contém um ambiente agradável para o dia a dia.
good,"working in one spot all day everyday. working fast for game tickets for amazon prizes to keep you awoke during working, very easy job but hard on the legs and back."
good,"Management has ISSUES THEIR HEADS GET BIG!!!! lack of Respect  for fellow worker.lack of training learn as you work,you get into trouble for other team members,Responsibilities."
good,Good environment for safety and working conditions.  Working for them was o but there was no way to move up in the company. The hours was short and there were no full time positions.
good,In my review working at Amazon was okay however from the start of the job the standards for picking and packing were set high which were based on colleagues who worked there for months.
good,I worked for a team in dartford supervisors gives local routes too his country men so there can earn twice as muck unfair ive report  this too manager of the team and lift job these foreign people have there wife s kids back in there countries and dont care working unsocialable hours
good,Good money tiring a good job make sure to eat right u need your energy and rest cause it is a job that will tire u put but also help you get fit from all that walking
good,"i did not have any issues working at amazon the people were friendly there's a lot of team work, stretching, making sure health is okay with the on site doctors its a wonderful company.  i would work there again."
good,"If your ok with standing in the same place, doing the same thing over and over then this is for you! Managers are lazy they don’t really help you out and the attendance policy is a joke!"
good,"Good,great p[lsce to work and I love and enjoyed my time there. I learned to work hard and smart in a very competitive environment."
good,The benefits are good the job pays the bills but if you get to many errors you will get fried from the company very easy. And all the management cares about is rate and getting the products out.
good,Very busy and productive environment with an emphasis on staying on track so everyone succeeds. Very clean and modern feel helps maintain good attitude.
good,"Responsible for new employee training: Amazon protocols and procedures, and daily warehouse functions to ensure the success of new employees "
good,"très bonne expérience en somme "
good,This is a very good job when you are between jobs.  The pay is low and the hours are long.  The work is not hard but it is tedious
good,"Amazon is good company to work for, but you have to deal with a lot of issues with management.  It is hard to get a promotion."
good,"Empresa organizada, Com grade faciliadade de aprendizado..."
good,They work you to hard and have to many point systems. I feel as though they need more structure instead of throwing rules all over the place not knowing or caring how they will effect people.
good,A typical day at work is usually 10 long hours. Its a fast pace work environment and has great pay. the hardest part of the job is standing up for such long hours.
good,"Great pay, nice place to work, however seasonal to start and not guarnteed to get permament postion."
good,Use this as a second part time job. You won’t be able to maintain off just this job. It’s a really good job for college kids who need to make some extra money... Or if you’re really trying to move up in the Amazon company.
good,Long hours and bad managers that changed every 2 months. Everyday has a handful of problems and for some reason management couldn’t solve them so it was up to the employees to solve
good,"Amazon isn’t a bad place to work. Personally I just think the warehouse environment isn’t for me. Now, the work isn’t as horrible as people would make it seem, the work environment could be a lot me cleaner, positive and fun."
good,Great place to build towards your resume and gain experience but not a good feeling when you dont know if you will be working the next day or not. Its temp to hire but you dont even get the chance to become permanent due to the overflow of hiring. I feel they hire too many people and dont have that much work when it comes to delivery so most days you are doing nothing. More management skills is needed when operating these local sites for delivery drivers and to give us the opportunity to be hired on permanently. Was advised we would have that option but I don't think that will happen as they are now laying off a large number of people.
good,Job was ok didn't have much ability to advance we had hard labor and different types of products that we had to deal with but if you like working and getting ability to work in warehouse this is the job for you
good,I hated the long hours during peak season and all of the walking but the money is really good and the only thing that kept me there. The people there are really nice too and helpful.
good,"J ai garde de mon passage de deux annees et demi chez amazon de tres bons souvenir.. Et helas une embauche en cdi qui n as jamais eu lieu .. Malgre tout mon potentiel et mon energie offert totalement a cette entreprise.."
good,Communication with your management is hard. Hours are great but you also feel like you miss out in life working so long. Overall very friendly and nice
good,As an Amazon shopper at Whole Foods I loved working there. Worked 8 months there and would have stayed if I didn’t have to move. Loved working on own without a manager around. As long as you are responsible in showing up on time and doing your work it’s an easy no brainer job. Nice safe environment not a lot of stress. You do work with a few unpleasant lazy employees that you need to watch out for who try not to work and pass the baton on to you if you aren’t paying attention. But they don’t last too long before managers find out. It’s not guaranteed a permanent schedule each week. You need to be quick on your phone when putting in your bid to pick up a time slot to work every few days( which I managed to figure out pretty quickly) . It’s a great part time flexible job if you don’t mind not knowing a set schedule for the month. If you do show up on time and not Have any knocks against you they do reward you in a opportunity to pick up days before others. Easy to get hired if your not a total loser. No interview!
good,"Everyone knows how Amazon went from a garage to a giant. Something must be working there. But the problem is that it has a very rude, aggressive culture passed on to all levels."
good,Though they pay decent and the benefits are awesome the competition for advancement is way to high and they higher outside the company for mgt positions faster than the offer them within. The pay doesnt balance out with the work load and stress of the jobs.
good,"There are bad behavior with our staff in this company like Supervisor, team leader, and station manager all is compny role n other staff is temprery base like delivery boy, station sport associate"
good,"A typical work day at Amazon would start off with "
good,"They were great to work for, no problems. "
good,The company is nice only if your a Amazon driver because huge amount cash an hr and get paid every two weeks(drivers only) mangers that are full time get a full benfits package not sure when besides a huge weeky paid check. Part-time mangers&employees don't make enough money to support them selfs or usually have a second job.
good,slave work wasnt worth the little money that they was paying.. they are very rude. they should have full time instead of part time it takes to long to get
good,Amazon is a really hard going job i enjoyed it while i was there but my contract was only for Christmas. I would of loved to stay on but there was no work for me.
good,Working at Amazon was a real crazy experience.  Since it was seasonal you would see so many people come and go.  It is a fast pace job and you always have to be on your feet and that's not something that my body could withstand I noticed. But if you like working in factories where everything is moving at a fast paced speed then that's the place for you.
good,"a day in the life as an amazon manager, tough"
good,Amazon is a productive and fun company to work for. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I also enjoyed learning new things from many different people.
good,"Gutes Arbeitsklima, gute Einarbeitung, mittelschwere körperliche Arbeit"
good,"work environment is very cool and casual in amazon, you can play music, sit in bean bags tto work and even work from home, pantry or cafeteria."
good,"Lead more than 140 associates daily "
good,I didnt really enjoy working by myself for 10 hours a day. I enjoy talking to people working with others ect.
good,"1. They train you for the job."
good,*Offer letter providing is a long process :(
good,"Pick department for 3 years , hard to advance , time management was too strict. I didn’t mind walking for 10 hours, although I wish there was more shift options and times"
good,"Fretta,inutili i corsi,perché chi li rispetta e rispetta il cliente non va avanti,gestione Amazon Svizzera e inattaccabile, perfetta,male i furgonari,difficile lavorare così veloce e male,bello fare le consegne"
good,"Buena empresa...buen ambiente .. competitividad ...los turnos hasta que te hacen blue es lo más complicado ,y la diferencia de ser picker   a empaquetado es mucha ...deberían rotar picker es muy duro .pero en general es bonito trabajar alli ...un día normal es entretenido aprendes a controlar tu cuerpo .. la dirección aprobada ...no siempre eso sí...la parte difícil es el agotamiento y la satisfactoria es que hay buena gente ."
good,I work there currently and to be honest you'd expect better from one of the biggest companies in the world. They expect you to hit high numbers but they are not willing to pay high numbers I would stay there but to be honest I can't make a living of of that pay.
good,"The pay was the only great part, but you had to push your physical limit to even hope to keep your job. Managers were bad and a good bit of people came and went weekly."
good,"I wish Amazon would pay their employees reasonably fair wages, better benefits and provide monetary performance based bonuses NOT Amazon gift cards. Additionally, it would be nice to have a policy that is totally committed to work/lefe balance."
good,"I would work for amazon again only if closer, the hours are long but are broken down with a paid lunch and a unpaid 30 min break as well lunch time 10-10:30p second break 2-2:30a then back to work until 5am unless the work week is a 12hr week but you have paid leave and unpaid if you can’t stay."
good,I was a contract driver so i can only speak for that part of the company. There were some organization issues but for the most part I enjoyed the job. Great pay when there was work.
good,"Company is fine everyone in the building is lovely when you actually talk and give a darn about them as well. But the management is absolutely horrifying! Literally start right before black Friday and all that went on and had been switched to take their carriers calls. Okay, perfectly fine we actually get a break from .02 second retail calls keep us there for two week where we have about 20 minutes in between calls and nah go back to retail with .02 seconds in between Let Me Do My Job Like I came there to take retail calls I knew that and I was fine with that but. Nah."
good,I did not like the job I was given.  Other jobs might have been alright.  I am just adding this sentence to have enough characters to complete the review.
good,"As fulfillment associate you will work where ever they decide they need you that day.  You do cross train for several jobs.  You had better be able to move fast or don't even try for the job.  They hire just about any one and are hiring all the time. "
good,very stress full place to work .managers need to be trained on real life.they need to replace them old computer with some newer ones in but they spent all that money on signs outside in parking lot
good,It was decent that you work in crazy conditions that u get sick by the time u get home do to working freezer and hot places you feel you hands freezeing
good,"It was a good job for the holidays but didn't view as a career. I feel that due to lack of advancement in the company, I didn't get a chance to express my greatest potential within the company and so had to find another place that allowed the expression of my greatest strengths."
good,I was constantly working the 11 hours I was there. I didn't like how it was ran. There were a lot of employees that weren't trained properly which obviously caused issues for everyone else. I just think the managers/trainers could've cared more for the employees on the floor.
good,"work hour too long, some day not a lot of work,handle by voluntary time off without pay. change manager too often no consistency. going back to work the same day you get off, no time for a good eight hours of sleep"
good,Amazon is an amazing company to work for as a young adult looking for a job paying more then McDonalds but the worker manager relationship is horrible
good,"You are working these long shifts with only a 30 minute lunch break, to me its unfair, the problem solvers and ambassadors are very rude and the lack of training they have is poor"
good,"You can learn lots of things and your collages are really genius and hard-working. But the workload is heavy and on-call is stressful sometimes. Overall, it is a good place to gain experience."
good,As a picker you walk 15 miles a night can't stop and talk to anyone else... the tempture inside the building can reach up to 100 degrees... just not a fun place to work...
good,"Working at Amazon isn't easy. I've seen people quit at lunchtime on their first day at work. For some, it is easy. Once you learn your job, you will then have a quota to meet. You had better meet it or you will be looking for work somewhere else."
good,"I want to work part time"
good,If you don't mind standing for 10 hours straight then best of luck to you. You get watched with your every single move you make. If you go to the bathroom or the client too long they will come and question you and ask you why you where gone so long.
good,"bonne ambiance "
good,"Empresa sem expectativa de crescimento, pessoal obsoleto com medo de perder emprego pelos novatos"
good,I learned how to pick and pack items and communicate with customers. load and unload lorries work well as a team and on my own and adapt to working life.
good,"There is always something new to learn at "
good,"tiring work (12hrs/day, 4-5days/wk) with good weekly pay. Learned to work efficiently for long periods of time and make sure a full system of people working in an assembly line worked smoothly."
good,"This was my first job and it was full-time +. A typical day was 10 hours and spent standing and walking. This warehouse was literally a mile long (the largest Amazon warehouse in North America. This is a great first job because it is the epitome of ""work-force"". During the holiday season this 5,000 + work force shipped more than 1.5 million packages. I was hired during this ""blackout"" season by a temp-agency (Integrity Staffing). After the new year some of us ""temps"" were transferred across the street to the customer return facility to process returned merchandise. This was line-work. 10-11 hours standing by a convener. Needless to say, lunch time couldn't come soon enough and never seemed to last long enough. The last two hours would become the most difficult as exhaustion set in and legs were ready to give out. Once the shift was complete we were all able to pat ourselves and each other on the back and say, ""Yes! We did it!""."
good,"One of the best places to work as far as being social while working. We never got in trouble for having fun while working,as long as you do what management asks. Met a lot of great diverse people there. This is not recommended for people with health issues because you are not able to have a work life balance, in order to keep up your health. Money was always pretty good but if you value family time this is not a place for you."
good,Good place to work but only temporary on the run up to Christmas.
good,"will work a lot"
good,"A very hectic day starting with clearing of mails and meetings."
good,"Constant moving and learning. All hands on work. Learned how to receive all different types of products and how to prep them to be shipped. We also learned how to unload trucks, cut boxes and use pallet jacks. How to make boxes and bubble wrap and bag items to be shipped out."
good,as a company amazon is great for customers but for its employees the only thing worth being a permanent employee is the benefits
good,There's always something new to learn that makes me wanna just learn more and knowing that can help me determine where i like it better so Ican ask management about it.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es agradable, peros las exigencias en numero a veces es sumamente estresante para algunas personas"
good,Turni pesanti ma stipendio ragionevole.Io la prima volta mi sono trovata più che bene.Non credete a tutto ciò che sentite.Piuttosto provate.La prima volta ti senti stimolato.La seconda volta personalmente sapendo già a cosa andavo incontro un'pò meno.Ero scoraggiata per via del contratto breve.
good,"For newcomers is best Job to start a career, i earned more than other places.. Get 1 year experience at least from here very beneficial. Only system of management is weak.. little bit pressure on employees.. but i am fine with or actually used to it ;)"
good,Horrible Management But good benefits and simple job. Would have to get adjusted to the work heavy schedule and longer than usual hours but the days off make up for it  and the decent pay
good,"Although I was hired as a ""Seasonal Driver"", I never had brought a package back that was not delivered and I found out that soon, Amazon will be getting rid of their drivers and giving all their work to ""Sub-Contractors"" which puts all their drivers out of a job."
good,"Stay out of the politics, arrive on time, do your work at the pace they expect, advocate for yourself if you get injured.  If you do that you will be fine."
good,"Great benefits for full-time employee. Good benefits for part-time also . High safe environment, willing to work with employees that go to school. Friendly"
good,"Amazon is a very good place to work if you want to stay active and get your exercise going. A typical day at amazon is to do a brief stretching exercise  before work and get directed to your job for the day it's either scanning packages to different container or unloaded trucks in receiving, Amazon will let you work yourself until you start hurting or develop a injury."
good,"Lavoro fisico continuo, non troppo pesante se si lavora in sicurezza"
good,"Having fun with work is essential part of work culture. Things are very informal & even seniors can be easily approached & they also come and talk to juniors even though its not needed. Still they make out time to talk casually. "
good,"I am working in amazon currently. Awesome work culture, free environment to feel like at home. However career growth doesn't come just by the hard work, have to also know corporate politics. Ethics are ruined by our own management. Revenue generating processes are given much importance then any other."
good,"It is hard work, you get paid pretty well.  The job training programs are good.  They help you move on to other companies.  There is no real room for advancement."
good,I don't actually work for amazon. I work with a company that bought into a DSP. But his company works under amazon. But we have the rules through Amazon. But we interact with amazon employees.
good,Great work environment with lots of opportunities to learn and grow. Quality of work experience is heavily dependent on team. Enjoy my work colleagues.
good,"Leadership was very shifty and unorganized. Not very consistent and the different shifts weren't coincident, harmonious. Advancement is somewhat of a joke and work expectations is as well. The work (for the ones who go above and beyond to achieve department goals as well as help others doesn't match the pay rate at all."
good,"I think Amazon was a great starter job for me and I learned a lot about making money and working for a company as it was my first job.  A typical work day was anywhere from three to five hours with one fifteen minute break.  I would spend the whole day either sorting packages or scanning them and putting them on pallets.  Some of the managers were very helpful and nice and knew just about everyone's name despite their being a lot of people.  Other managers weren't as helpful or nice and discouraged my work habits at Amazon.  The hardest part of this job was staying engaged or interested.  It wasn't very fun or challenging and often times repetitive, so often times it got pretty boring.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting a paycheck and working with people I knew."
good,Working at Amazon was a great way for me to make money and lose weight all in one. I enjoyed the environment that we were in and also the other employees.
good,Very very physically demanding. Didn't get any PTO. Got three points for absence when I was sick with an excuse. Received no help with a two-man job. underpaid for the work required.
good,"I didn't feel enough time was given for breaks and lunch for the contract work team.  I am a physically fit person but found standing all day in a demanding job where it wasn't easy to step away for a break, food, or to do to the bathroom was very difficult to handle.  I didn't feel like the work environment was conducive to a positive culture.  I think things have changed and there is more flexibility now."
good,Great place to work if you like fast paced and have a keen eye for detail. I loved working there but the shift times kept changing and it was no longer conducive to my life and being able to spend time at home with my kids before they went to bed for the night.
good,"Ottimo ambiente lavorativo ma di contro ci sono troppe figure “in alto” che se ne fregano è trattato i nuovi arrivati con disprezzo.."
good,"Compensation is lacking;"
good,"Always have to work hard to try to fix the problem for the client and make him happy, it’s not easy to resolve everything every time, but that keep you concentrated"
good,"Amazon is a large tech company who is growing in massive scale. But at the end of the day please point me to the headline ""Amazon"" voted best employer... So do your research. The whole bathroom thing? I don't know anything about that."
good,amazon was an fast and productive workplace. security was strict entering and exiting the building. it was a challenging pack and ship  customers order
good,"In DMI3, Miami, FL, I experienced the overworking of dozens of elderly people in the 12am-5:30am sortation shifts. I stopped requested time off on my amazon hub due to a strep throat infection only to be terminated withing two days. I would love to return to Amazon, but unable to because I was terminated. The management needs to be addressed."
good,I can work as much as i wish too.Can make up to $400 plus per day.The contract requires due diligence in time and money management.Things are changing so fast..that it is important to stay in tune with the company and its operations.
good,it was a good place to work but all of the  walking and rules that they make you follow that are not about the job are point less but i would work there any day
good,"With a Bachelors now, and while currently studying to get my Masters, I can say love my job and the company but the pay rumors are absolutely true ...I literally have to decide between groceries and paying rent. Seeing my bi-weekly paycheck kills me but given my employment history AND with private sector and public sector companies, Amazon is the best business model I've worked for ever. Endless amounts of training, self starters and producers are encouraged, recognition is everywhere you look, even the numerous amounts of reports that I run and complete and report on are beyond interesting - as I know it is all for the greater good of production. I am simply maintaining to increase the desirability of my resume to move elsewhere for my financial sanity. I will hate to leave, but my basic survival needs for my family outweigh the pros."
good,Nice work place but don’t have lot of benefits until you are blue badge  can take up to 4  o 5 months they don’t pay lunch hour and for the work that u do that’s  really exhausting the paid is not fair
good,No actual comments or review about amazon at this time.  I had a job to perform and I believe I performed it to the best of my abilities.  The position and the atmosphere as a whole was just right at the time
good,"Wer einmal bei Amazon als Mitarbeiter registriert ist sollte zur Arbeit kommen können wann er will. "
good,Breaks suck cause you dont get your full 15 minutes. Lunch sucks cause you dont get your full 30. the rate is almost imposible to keep. an overall very stressful job
good,"Good part time with decent pay. Very diverse culture which is a good thing. Management has pros and cons like any other place, just do what's required and go if you aren't trying to make a career, they will not promote you to management unless you have a degree at DFW 8"
good,"Stowing on night shift was very quiet but, someone had to put the radio on full blast one night and, i nearly fell over in shock as the speaker was almost above my head, looking like a lamp shade."
good,"Empresa gigante, en la que es muy dificil congeniar vida laboral con la vida personal. Contratos precarios. Poca estabilidad laboral"
good,"very good pay, alot of chances for advancement, alot of hours and overtime but overall, the company had little regard for its staff, often being unfair or unwilling to be reasonable."
good,"Trabaje muy a gusto los primeros 3 meses y se cumplieron todos los objetivos, de pronto de buenas a primeras todo cambio nos cambiaron las zonas , aumentaron las cargas, el trato dejo de ser cortes , etc. Espero poder regresar lo mas pronto posible y encontrar de nuevo el ambiente agradable y sano para salir adelante . 😎"
good,"Please be mindful of the TYPE of Amazon FC you're working in. Some are total PPT, others require walking. Safety is a MUST when visiting or working in these facilities! Not everyone will comply. You SHOULD."
good,"This is an exciting place to work, but they expect you there 12 hours a day -- every day. They are very innovative and provide a lot of opportunity to advance."
good,I like working for this company but the way the offers and jobs are released I could do better and be fair about it when I first started I had a job every day but now it’s hard to get work because whoever is responsible for releasing the jobs or giving reservations are not being fair with the listings I know some who get a lot of listing for a particular day and I wouldn’t see any listing on my phone. This is just for the Chesapeake va areas when I was assigned to Springfield it was two reserved blocks for me  constantly.
good,Working at Amazon is very stressful because it’s take to long to get to the break room which shortens your break. It’s hard to find a manager as well.
good,"Fast paced but still able to work and talk and make freinds. The best part about the job is the different type of people you get to work with. The worst part is how little you get to be around managers and HR, it almost feels like higher ups neglect you and dont pay attention to peoples hard work. Favoritism is also a huge problem but none the less its a great company to work for especially for those with no job experience."
good,"Amazon is a great place to start working and to get used to the working lifestyle. Some people complain about work like balance but they give plenty of time off most of the time to compensate. The pay is fair, not great but the benefits make up for the lack of pay. The management can be great or terrible depending on who you get for your approximately 6 month period. The job isn't really to enjoy you do it to have a job and to advance towards somewhere else with their great education benefits (95% paid schooling, CDL training, and others)."
good,"good place to work good environment "
good,Amazon is great to work for and benefits are amazing. There is no work like balance even when one try to have a balance. You learn a lot from the company and people you work with but if you are not willing to work 14 hours and 6 days you may lose your job. You have to be available over the phone/ email/ or text.
good,Fun first job I enjoyed myself and had a good experience for my first job. I hope to work again with customers as it is my passion. I would go back to Amazon if I could.
good,"Expérience très bonne . Appris beaucoup de chose comme le travaille en équipes, l'autonomie"
good,"Great place to work, managers are never around and there is a lot of drama that goes on. So many people date each other in the call centers and makes life difficult for others without personal matters involved. The management sucks and they blame others for nonsense. People walk around without socks and shoes on so sometimes the place smells like feet."
good,"Orientações para os gerentes das lojas, contato direto com a equipe do jurídico para que não houvesse falhas."
good,"stayed hot and boring"
good,It's ok there but the management could use some improvement. There is great security there but there where a couple of fights in the warehouse.
good,"Always work for us to do, management was very helpful, coworkers were very encouraging, hardest part was lifting heavy boxes over 70 pounds but not impossible, and I enjoyed the job overall."
good,Amazon is best sales company present in our market.i think giving best salary in that company.and I wood  like to sales in Amazon company.i will do any job in your company
good,"I learned the best in deliveries in England, but for lack of work on a daily basis had to opt out of this company because I need of ongoing and stable !! I am willing to work seven days a week with full performance and flexible hours!"
good,"Lots of hyper customers, hardest part was filling all orders in a timely fashion."
good,loved the pay rate. coworkers were enjoyable. job was pretty hard and time consuming
good,"Overall, a great experience to work for them. We worked 10 hour shifts loading trucks all day. It helped me to gain strength, but was the hardest job I've ever done."
good,A empresa oferece ao funcionário uma boa oportunidade para desenvover seus conhecimentos.
good,The benefits are the main reason why people stay. The managers are hit and miss. Night shift has the better leaders to get a long with. Good luck promoting from T3 to L4
good,"Assez fatiguant, il faut travailler vite, être organisé et rapide"
good,Mi experiencia no fue. Buena  aunque pagan bien era muy estresante y sigo diciendo que no miran si eres un buen trabajador sino si eres atractiva/o  tendrían que poner un vestuario no  como van las mujeres
good,I had a great time working and meeting with new people. Everyone was friendly and took the time to connect. I liked the work from home option for one day a week.
good,You need to be at the top of your game to excel here. The premises and office ambience is impeccable. The training team will ensure that you possess the right skills before moving into production.
good,"A job for little pay, management is clueless, alot of favoritism. Long hours during Oct-Dec. Meet all types of people, dont look to be hired for advancement from within"
good,Good opportunities but the best thing is that is a good e-commerce platform for all other employees . Also its about the people who is supporting them within their society because they are society.
good,"Not paid fairly, no raises, but there is a lot of OT!!! Laid back if u know what ur doing or else u will have dispatch calling u all the time... don’t rely on getting rescued everyday!!"
good,"Seguridad Laboral, confort, libertad de expresión, liderazgo"
good,Either doing inventory at a station with an rf scanner going up and down a ladder all day or fixing audits on a computer which is called problem solve.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and it was decent to work there nice and quick shifts decent opportunities to get another shift supervisors sucked though not understanding the flow of packages on a line made it irritating to work because you simply tried to keep big packages from stopping the line but they are more worried about your scan rate when some of are actually working hard picking up big packages to keep a steady flow on the line
good,"it was a seasonal position long hours pay was not what it is now "
good,"Good Satisfaction of work , new experience, togetherness , team building activities often , motivation often , appreciation often , chance only to get promoted,"
good,"Purtroppo non ho potuto continuare la mia esperienza all'interno di questa bellissima realtà, spero di trovare un altro luogo di lavoro così oppure rientrare in questa azienda."
good,"I totally enjoyed working for this company. Great experience , I actually wouldn’t mind going back. I just hated the mandatory overtime around the holidays"
good,It was good I learned a lot in  Little time I was put in different areas and I did a good on all of them different jobs the mangers loved me cause I was good at multitasking.
good,Great place to work. Turnover rate was a bit much.  They were good at getting you excited and ready to start your shift . There was a lot of walking which was great for staying healthy
good,"Good Company but more focused towards profitability rather than employee development."
good,"I think Amazon is a great company. They lacked organization. And, at times I felt that the management didn't care about the employees. Maybe they just needed more time. It was a new facility and they were trying to find their way while trying to run a business."
good,there is no job security at all. AMAZON descriminate against you if you are a green badge. I worked hard just to be told after 6 months sorry you arent needed and to reapply again after 2 months. managers useless and only good thing was the money.
good,"Long work days and very fast paced environment. Competitive workplace. Lots and lots of walking and heavy lifting, Training is the easiest part of the learning process, Very strategic training,"
good,"I work  the morning shift at an Amazon warehouse. a typical  day at my warehouse, i am in returns so what that means is i would receive packages from a conveyor. i would open packages inspect the contents of the product, and see if the item is eligible for resale or is returned to the vendor to be  refurbished or replaced."
good,Working here is good just wish somethings can change such as the terrible benefits we get 10% off any products that are sold by amazon WOW BECAUSE AMAZON MOSTLY IS 3RD PARTY SELLERS.
good,"the culture of AWS is very dog-eat-dog. that said, the pay was good and in the right areas, it could be easier for different personalities who didn't deal with conflict all the time."
good,"I started working for Amazon as a self employed driver with my own van to earn some extra cash over the winter. During the two day training period we were told that the routes were planned 9 hrs routes with a 30 mind break included. Not true at all. I started in November & didn't get a break at all during the 10-12 he days. 300 parcels on some occasions & if you fell behind for example getting stuck in traffic you get money deducted to pay for another driver to take parcels off you. That sucks, especially as you are still expected to finish the route that you know you being paid less for. Family never got to see me hardly & you are expected to turn up for work with the minimum of notice but they expect a weeks notice from you if can't work. Very one sided system. I was lucky to have my own van but people who hire them are working for next to nothing after deductions. You start to feel very unappreciated very quickly & if you dare complain then you can expect to be out of work very quickly. If you are a yes man then this will suit you. If not then don't bother as you be demoralised by day two."
good,"I really liked the flexible hours, it fits my personal life and school schedule perfectly. In the future I look forward to work for amazon after I get my bachelors degree."
good,"Ambiente piacevole per il lavoro, danno molti posti di lavoro alle persone. Il lavoro è un po 'duro e puoi sentirti stanco dopo alcune settimane, ma è positivo per i giovani"
good,"Fast work pace, hard work, flexible hours, no weekends off, no 401 k, no insurances planes, no sick pay no time n a half for holiday pay, moving from station to station work ."
good,hours enough for everyone pay increase after 40/50 hrs good way to make xmas dollar full of second languages good working environment good staff okay food hall
good,"Great if you are looking for solid, steady work with a schedule that never changes. You will learn your job and repeat it continuously over a ten hour work shift. You only get two breaks and a lunch."
good,"fun days and long"
good,Working at MDW4 was cool. I loved the pay checks and benefits as well as they schedule. Be careful when working here though they have a high turn over rate for a reason.
good,"ambiente stimolante , team leader preparati e disponibili"
good,"Great perks and benefits, very high turn over.  Management is fair though holds almost unattainable goals. Employees are just a job number and they will replace you."
good,"The company is not doubt earth's most customer centric company "
good,you have the luxury of working from home when ever you want. This makes your work schedule incredibly flexible. I learned how to work under a time limit. but there wasnt too much pressure
good,"Long Days, Insufficient job training, In adequate support from managers, Unorganized. The benefits are the best part of the job. Very supportive human resource department."
good,"This is a good company to work for, but if you can not keep up a good pace it is not for you. The work is face paced and your scan rate is checked throughout the day against all the workers."
good,amazon was an ok place to work. the money was good for what you had to do there. you get to meet new people and make good friends. over all not too bad to work for.
good,The only down fall is your doing someone else food and grocery shopping for them... it was cool but than I would have to go home and do grocery shopping for myself as well
good,"Not the best place, no raises whatsoever. The only insentives were Smart Bucks tha can buy you an Amazon shirt or binnie or a cup. "
good,"I've worked for amazon during the last 3 peak seasons and I can say the pay is worth the work, along with the benefits given, I'd definitely go back once i have absolute reliable transportation."
good,With this site you really dont have room for growth. If you not a favorite no matter how much of a hard worker you are they rather have a person that wont think for themselves. Its called a yes person to take the fall for them.
good,Good place to work but management was just all over the place everything was so discombobulated and very unorganized I feel like the managers don't really help you out as much
good,"While working and amazon i would verified inventory computations and investigated discrepancies and adjusted errors. Sorter. Determined proper storage methods, identification and stock location based. Provided assistance and direction to other stockroom, warehouse, or storage yard workers."
good,"Integrity Staffing Solutions is a temp service that places people at 9 Amazon Fulfillment locations in Phoenix, Arizona. I enjoyed working as a picker. The hours were long and the work was physically demanding, but, rewarding."
good,"I highly recommend amazon for younger workers. It is fast paced job and some departments are harder to work at than others. Management tends to be very helpful, but they transfer departments and buildings fast. This job works around school schedule which helps out a lot in advancement. overall I recommend this job for anyone that needs a job to acquire experience and anyone that is in school."
good,unfair management but overall the work was easy. people are nice but they suck at communication with their employees if you work nights you have no life
good,"This place is all about finding friends you make your family and keep you working hard goals fun to hit  if you decide to work here long hours and long days but the pay is worth it "
good,As a seasonal employee there was not much of a chance to become a permanent employee. The hours were easy and the actual job was also very easy . There was minimal stress .
good,"it was good . "
good,We good place to work I was seasonal and had personal problems but beside that good people loved working alone there hours were great days was wonderful
good,"Great innovative company on solid financial ground. Much opportunity to grow your career if you are a new graduate and in with the clique. Some plants are managed very well, some need much work and development of infrastructure / support departments."
good,"At Amazon I learned how to prepare orders, scan orders into the system. The job itself was very fun easy going and laid back. The thing i liked the most about amazon was the constant movement and being able to learn new things and different techniques everyday. It was also a nice environment you always got to see and meet new people which is something i like."
good,Easy job to learn but can be very physical for some you must work at a fast pace at most times. They tell u to bring a friend I had a opportunity to work closely with my wife. Opportunity to earn decent wage and better
good,its fast pace work and very fun must be willing to move and learn new things along with new people. not very flexible when it comes to shift changes or personal issues.
good,Picker for amazon. ten hour shifts walking up and down the factory and isles. simplistic everyday objective to get a certain amount of picks. with patience and dedication objective was reached.
good,I loved helping the people but my leads person was terrible. You could not get the information you needed from her. During the Christmas time it was even worse. She could not or would not help.
good,"good place to work"
good,The job hours were reasonable. Overtime was always available. I was working through a temporary agency so benefits were not provided. The pay was not decent.
good,Typical day its pretty easy work. Not enough mental stimulation. I've been there three months and haven't learned anything except minimum skills to do the job. Great benefits and a guaranteed 40 hour work week.
good,"Im looking for a job where i can explore myself .and gain good salary according to my effort .and i want to work in such a company rules are equals for everyone "
good,"Sembra un lager, poco tempo per la mia vita privata, pessimo cibo. nemmeno non hai tempo per andare a servizi"
good,"If Amazon hired more experienced and diversed managers and supervisors, employees would stay employed longer. As far as the work itself, it is very easy anyone could do the job as long as you take your time to learn the job."
good,"Good place to work, just long hours and awkward schedules. The pay is good, but the lack of union allows them to pretty much treat employees however they want to."
good,"I learned what mental strength I had. I walked fifteen miles per shift, I worked ten hours shifts sometimes six days a week. I wouldn't trade my experience for anything in the world."
good,"It was fun place to work at, free lunches and benefits to employee, customer satisfaction was the gist of management. It was not ready to listen advancement of employees as far as career is concerned."
good,"I enjoyed working there but was sick at the time and wouldn't mind at all trying it again, especially under more stable employment circumstances."
good,Great co-workers long hours and shifts but pays good. Breaks are alright. Lots of overtime hours and good for paychecks. Managers are great to work with they lead by example. Overall fun and good place to work.
good,"o trabalho era um pouco cansativo , mais depois de tudo concluído era bastante satisfatório, como foi apenas um estagio foi de extrema importancia para agregar nos meus conhecimentos, tinha uma otima relação com todos companheiros de equipe, entretanto as vezes quando precisávamos de algum equipamento especifico a empresa não nos dar o suporte adequado."
good,"The atmosphere is jovial and team oriented, the little perks make an employee feel appreciated but the metrics that they hold their employees to are unrealistic and it leaves a black mark on peoples' resumes."
good,was a repetitive place to work was like ground hog every day.
good,"A typical day at amazon is a horrible one. The management does not listen to the employees of lower level. They cut no slack for the people that are allowing their business to run smoothly. And by this I mean they are slave drivers. They expect too much in one day and push their employees to breaking points, all while not listening to suggestions. Why ask for suggestions then make up some outrageous rule that actually worsens an employees day making it harder for them to do their job? amazon should be an award winner for that. The ONLY part of my job at amazon that gave me hope were my coworkers. I've never met much nicer, hardworking, lovable people in my life. I learned a lot while at Amazon. What it takes to move up in the business world is hard but doable. I just never wish to go back to it."
good,"My co workers are the reason why I stay at my job"
good,I would see a lot of items in the warehouse that I did not know exist. I also learned how to operate a cherry picker and all my co- workers were very helpful by answering all my questions.
good,"nice job , just stuck in a warehouse all day or all night. Manager and everyone very nice, but alot of things have to be speedy no slow moving at all."
good,"laid off after 1 month, other than that the work was fairly easy and the pay was very good."
good,The worst part is just getting use to the long days and when you run out of work. But other then that its a good paying job with great people working there.
good,"consistent daily tasks with flexibility and autonomy to accomplish goals and help others learn the job.  team environment, good pay, sad to have to relocate and leave organization."
good,Bel posto con un'organizzazione migliore  spaziale
good,Good place to work at very friendly manager are great nice employees hours are frat fast pace i will recommend anybody to work there it’s deff a good place to work at
good,"I had a good experience working at Amazon. The staff and team members were very helpful ! It can be challenging at times due to the fact this job is very fast pasted, being a fast learner is a really good benefit working here, you only have a ride along for one day then your on you own so paying attention to details is a must. Being familiar with your route is also very helpful. I loved dealing with the customers and having the ability to be on your own. I enjoy working here !"
good,"Great people to work for , hours are great, pay is amazing, lost of room for family , good with requests days off , easy learning and orientation is easy"
good,"La Presentazione aziendale molto buona, ma crea aspettative più alte di quel che poi si riceve, per quanto riguarda collaborazione e corsi"
good,"Great place to work! Tons of people to reach out to for help, information is just a click away, they provide you with laptop and head set, there really help you get set up for WFM."
good,"not alot of pressure, easy job, very flexible. i dont like how you select shifts that would be my main complaint, no real HR everything is digital which isnt totally bad."
good,"Very good place to work of you like fast paced jobs, many hours and overtime, friendly environment. Strong teamwork management. All about the safety of there employees."
good,"Enjoy meeting the Post Office Workers, Great Bonus from current position, JW Staff very professional, Enjoy working with them. I am on Independent Contractor, run loads in 26 foot Box Truck, Employed Since 2017 to Present"
good,"There are great opportunities and even though you're paid to work they always show appreciation ,  we were all treated fairly and your opinions matters."
good,"Fast-paced, an overall good working environment with lots of opportunities but only for those who have obtained a blue badge which means you're a permanent worker at the warehouse. Wages are good on night shifts."
good,"Amazon Sortation center is a easy place to work for in the holidays and beyond. A typical night shift at amazon ran about from 9:15pm to 5:45am. All it was playing either doing one of many things. Stowing packages in the correct sortation spot. Sorting the packages on the line, making sure that are going to the right racks. Inducting the packages so they have a place to go. getting pallet jacks and removing gaylords off of the truck."
good,"work was not hard, good hours dimensions.  it was possible to stay overtime.  fairly satisfying salary. two-way transport provided.  friendly people.."
good,Great job just lots of walking lots of hills you may have to walk up and also the customers u have to have a patience and have to know how to communicate with people
good,"I have a good experience while I’ve been working for Amazon, my skills improved and as well I learned to do a quality work, not just a quantity. I learn how to react when I have something new to do, and I really enjoyed to improved my skills"
good,"Sicurezza, precisione e lavoro di squadra sono le parole chiave e le competenze che ho acquisito durante la mia esperienza presso questa azienda."
good,Perfect environment to work in for a middle level experienced person. I loved the way amazon thought me about their policies and processes at work. Best in class.

good,Good work hard stay focus stay determined people will derail you just keep going hard work pays off believe me love what you do & the rest will follow
good,This company has strict rules and regulations on time limits and locations. You have to be punctual and consistent when working at amazon. Long days with lot of hard work
good,"I have worked with amazon for more than 24 months; so far the journey was good however the competition is very high internally for promotion and of course frequent changes in policy so I could not find the management stable. "
good,"The company really takes care of their employees, and has a great environment as a work place I recommend others to work at a place with good team work as amazon does"
good,"No Matter what you are pushed to complete the warehouse goal, everyday you would have to get at least 400 picks per hour. Even though the robots that bring you the items for the customers tend to mess up you still have to do your best and complete your goal."
good,Me yevo una espiencia muy bonita unos conpañero muy bueno y muy buen trabajo quiera esta de nuebo ay

good,The environment was great the people was great to work with it’s just not my type of job ! I’d like to be able to have the option to work with different stations!
good,The pros to working at Amazon is the pay and the cool people you work with. The cons to working at Amazon is the mandatory overtime having the same routine everyday.
good,I wish there were more shifts available at my location. I can only work evenings and there are never any available shifts. I enjoy the work. the team leaders can use a little help in motivating the. team members.
good,"The people are good, training and benefits are given. Good work place with games to chill. Its a goos company to work with. There are lots of people there."

good,"my diet /exercise/self interest to conquer tough ruts within, progressed me day to day. The High level of personal information leaks aired to the public were enormous, unwanted social warfare. provided care was self applicable, all and all in the end there was too much terror and attack to bare ..the people i worked with (co-workers) had no respect for each others space and home in which they privately live, invaded my mind and walked all over my kids , as a starter to provide.  I felt invaded with no aroma of comfort to heal  .."

good,"Associates have flexible hours of work or shifts and  breaks in between. I have learned to go extra mile in helping customer meet their needs, to be more empathetic and improve customer experience. Management support our growth in the company and easy to reach out even on their off days. It was a good workplace in building team morale through team outings, potlucks and other occasions to celebrate. The hardest part of the job was maintaining/reaching the performance metrics and  getting the promotions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being recognize for the achievements and resolving customer's issue."

La società in quanto tale è molto preparata con l'organizzazione. Ci sono buone opportunità per migliorare e aiutare i tuoi colleghi. La parte più difficile è stata dire addio a questo lavoro accogliente e la migliore è stata il calore umano e la sicurezza.
good,"Great people, great atmosphere, Managers and team leaders are so helpful and very easy to approach. I like that there are different roles, so you aren't doing the same thing every shift. Great workout, you are always moving."
good,A typical day at amazon is very fast paced which makes the time go by faster. The management team was awesome and worked with you if you had any problems. The hardest part of the job was the first few days because of all the standing but I quickly adapted to that. The best part of the job was working with other associates and the environment.
good,I loved working for Amazon!  Due to having to provide care giving services to my grandfather I resigned. Amazon is an awesome company to work for if you are in the job market.
good,"As far as a place to work, always busy, job security, co-workers were friendly. Adequate break time and on occasion the company would have company parties to thank employees for all their hard work."
good,"non u bel posto di lavoro, pressione molto alta, lavoro usurante."
good,"Not a bad place to work, however, in order to promote you must be willing to relocate.  There's always a push to innovate so much so that you can get drained easily."
good,It can be cool but annoying at the same time. Mainly due to most of the young people having no respect and/or no work ethic but the culture and environment is forever changing.

good,It was ok. Very busy .stressful at prime time and holidays. No follow up when had to leave on medical reasons out if my control.  They didn't care if u didn't like the jobs they made u do.

Different people from different cultures and religions, it helps you open your mind. You learn the American people also, from the calls. You have people who want you to tell them about South Africa."
good,"I was in the company for 6 months. Though I have 9 years of experience in Customer Care, Amazon teaches you the next level of what customer care is. It is the best ideal place for freshers who want to start their career with the BPO's"

good,"Pda .orders     benning .Counting ,labeling shipping recieving, stowing.  Only bad incident, when scanning  products in packages  or bulk. Their is more items important  scan every items not the package. So there wont be any shortages"
good,"Although the overall work day was the same (unloading and loading the trailers with product, checking in and out the trailers, receiving customer returns), you were still faced with something new to learn. You have to think quickly on your feet when the team is surprised with an unscheduled inbound shipment. Problems need to be solved creatively and effectively, all while you need to maintain the schedule for other routes."
good,Lovely work atmosphere. Easy fun face pace learning environment. I was Quick to learn new things there. Easy to get around everything's was in order. I would be very happy for a new opportunity.

good,"Mi sono trovata molto bene a lavorare in Amazon, mi sono adattata subito al mestiere."

good,"Amazon is a great company. They help in so many ways to set you on a career path. Day on and day out it all the same, open a package, scan it answer a few questions about it, tag it and put it in the appropriate tote. Not rocket science."

good,All the workers are friendly and respectful it's a real easy job.. there's nothing bad I can say about the job I really loved it I want another job like it
good,"Amazon provides flexible working hours students, which is why I eas able to commute to Nyack from PA to graduate. Also, I received 95% of my tuition paid for attending Lehigh Community College to review accounting courses.  I did great with passing marks of A's.  So, I returned to Nyack College and graduated 5/5/2018."
good,I would love to work for amazon again very easy and fast paced in your own work space  I would recommend a friend or family to work for amazon. I would like to fill out another application.
good,"Excellent working environment."

good,"On of the best companies I have work for. They actually care about you as a person, and push you hard. If you like to work hard, work here. If you don’t, then don’t."
good,"This was my first physical job in sixteen years and I loved it. Not gonna lie, I was sore everyday (including days off) for about the first three weeks. If you are willing to learn they will teach you and train you for any job in the building, I came in during August and the rush of back to school shopping that exceeded the companies' expectations. I stayed on until February the next year. The lead up to the winter holidays made for loads of opportunity and variety. There was many great leaders in the management team. One in particular I greatly enjoyed working with. I myself have over a decade of being in management and my approach is this; I am always going to be working next to my team and will never ask someone to do a job I am not willing to do myself. This red vest proved shift after shift to be of the same mind and was more than a manager, they were a leader. I would work for the company again without hesitation."
good,This place is such an awesome employment opportunity. With the pay the benefits and how friendly and open everyone is. It's amazing. Communication is key here. They have mastered it all.

good,"Great company to work for with an amazing culture! Unfortunately, I hit the glass ceiling. As long as your manager is supportive of your career growth, I would certainly recommend working here."
good,"I have over 4 years’ experience in Business world and through that time, I have proven to be a dedicated hard-worker, dedicated to providing outstanding administrative and organizational skills, familiar with IT; diary management; basic accounting, with excellent communication skills."

good,Excellent work environment I really enjoy working here I just wish it was more hours during the week I live the experience I’m getting driving to different locations
good,"Working at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Crest Hill, IL has been easily my favorite job compared to my previous jobs. Just wish they offered more hours but a good extra job to have if you can work with the schedule."
good,"It's a great seasonal job, easy, no stress. There really isn't too much advancement options for seasonal workers, after the season ends the contracts end, usually around 500 or so workers are released or called back next season."
good,I loved working at Amazon. There was always something to do and a skill to learn. It was never boring. I looked forward to going into work everyday at the time I worked there.
good,"I love the culture at Amazon.  The organization fosters collaboration, teamwork and motivation for the teams to achieve common goals.   The organizational structure is less heirarchical and their open door policy is commendable."
good,"A typical day would include beginning stretches, then go to assigned areas and work. Great work culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was the weekly pay. The hardest part of the job is that it is a very physically demanding job, however by working here I eliminated my gym membership as it was more than enought to keep fit, if that is what you are looking for then I guess it really isn't very hard :)."

good,"A typical day at work would be fast pace, paying attention to detail, and getting the job done. I learned how to move swiftly and get things done. The hardest part of my job was the time span you were given to get things done, but I got them done. My management team were nothing but great people. I enjoyed them most!"
good,"The work is not bad at all, just very repetitive. The warehouse does get extremely hot in there though since their isnt any AC. Overall good money for easy work."
good,"Stowing, Sorting, Sanitizing, People are nice, security is good, Food is good and they recognize those who are on time and have great attendance. Great place to work"

good,I liked working for amazon is they dont discriminate all races and religion work there they have a place to go and worship i like that and the people are nice.
good,I worked there for their seasonal position for customer service. It was fast paced and great experience with the customers. I worked in 3 departments. I am waiting for them to post new positions so I can re apply
good,Depends on what department you're working for. I went from being a packer to an Ambassador to slam operator to problem-solving. I feel like an easier way to get promoted. You would have started when Amazon launches a new building.
good,Was employed for over a year and was forced to resign because I became pregnant. A highly disappointing factor. The trucks during the winter were brutal. No heat only a fan during the summer. The environment wasn’t so bad but the supposed “15 minutes” were really 8 minites. The grace period to walk to the breakroom was ridiculous
good,"At Amazon Fulfillment Centers, you gain the experience of working in a supply chain and management environment. There are different departments that you might be a part of."
good,"it was okay however they're strict on break times, ouches and clock in's and out's to the minute. and they worked us to the very second of clocking out."

good,This job was very enjoyable to me as IT personnel. Amazon has the latest and greatest technology and having the opportunity to work with provided crucial experience that I still utilize to this day.

The managers are always complaining about your speed of work and they treat you like children, rewarding you with little wrapped candies or amazon bucks for a job well done. its also hard to get time off due to the fact that there is an aloted amount. You cant call off if you are sick and have no aloted time off otherwise you'll be fired. so you must either work while sick or be fired!"
good,"It pays well, but it takes all your time. They don`t see every body equal and they try to keep you only for a short time. They solve every issue or conflict through releasing the involved persons."

good,Everything and everyone was great. They have a lot of people that help you and they come around to check to see if you are okay and if you need any help to go and talk with them
good,You come in and get conditioned and work 3-5 hours and go home and if they flex up you can stay 5 hours but are open to pick up on my hub website. It’s just not a full time job and I feel like this is a perfect job if you don’t have rent to pay.

good,"•	Involved in development of high performance software systems and processes that identify and prevent fraudulent transactions across all Amazon platforms. "
good,"Not the ideal job for most people, the targets seem a bit absurd sometimes, they have a very low tolerance for unstable rates even when it's not the employee's fault. They state that safety is top priority, sometimes it's clear that all they care about is productivity. You may have a hard time achieving the rates expected on picking and stowing following all the safety procedures."

good,"This job is an absolute dream job. The pay Iis unbelievable,  but unfortunately as a freelance worker,  I'm not always guaranteed work. The only downside besides non-guaranteed work,  is having to pay in to taxes at the end of the year as a private contractor."

good,A particular day at work when I was chosen to be an ambassador which would have me to train the new employees . The management was awesome they was there to answer what ever questions you had also made things easy to under.
good,Good pay good hours good benefits but unethical work. It is unethical work because of the numbers you have to keep up with per hour. I was a picker and I had to pick 100 items an hour but doing the same thing for ten hours is unethical and meeting that demand is as well especially with the obstacles. I think if they gave 8 hour shifts five days a week people would want to stay.

good,It's a good place good people if you aren't lazy. Lots of people complain about it but it's not hard if you do it and the pays good. You'll always know what to expect walking in everyday.
good,Amazon trusts young managers with challenging roles.  Managers gain a great amount of experience in a short period of time.  Invaluable to my current leadership experience.
good,"I liked working for amazon because it was at home based work, and very flexible, I got to choose my own hours as well and my schedule."
good,"The shifts are typically 10-11 hours a day. I learned the process of pick, pack along with being involved with the ship dock. Management is very helpful there with a lot. They do a whole lot of fun activities during breaks as well as giving out prizes."

I would recommend a lot of people to work at Amazon because they have a lot of benefits once you switch over to Fulltime and they also pay good, the work is also just as easy."
good,"I worked at an Amazon warehouse and I realized this is something I excel at. The conversion process was a little disorienting. There's a point system in place only I wasn't exactly sure how it worked and how many points I somehow accrued. The people from Integrity Staffing told me I had 7 than another person would tell me I got 3. From a productivity standpoint  I could tell I was on par or even better than ""blue badges"". But this is the part I don't get, how come I wasn't given a permanent position? I could only surmise it was some sort of miscommunication that I wasn't aware of. So Amazon HR if you could read this, do your homework and you will find that I am more thean the ideal candidate you are looking for."
good,"Fast paced, very alone, you have to reach a certain quota everyday . I had to do the picking and sorting postitions and it was really fun anhd fast paced."

good,This role required for me to persevere and push through a hard days work and also showed me a lot about myself. Warehouse operatives and agency managers develop an excellent understanding overtime due to feedback and targets therefore you are always motivated and pushed to the best of your abilities. The hardest part of this job was the physical part this was from picking for example. The most enjoyable part of it was the environment and the communication with everyone this made this a fun working environment.

good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon. They paid for my schooling. They provide great benefits for employees. I would have stayed there if I could drive for them.
good,long hours and sometimes too tedious I constantly feel the need to be in a better workplace. The people are genuine and its a good place for hard honest work.
good,A day at Amazon went like this. You'd start out by clocking in and joining your team for daily stretches and announcements. You'd then go to your designated station and start putting away items if you were a stower or picking items if you were a picker. This would go on for a good 10 hours with breaks and a lunch in between. co-workers are hit and miss but they're mostly good help when you need it. management is also hit and miss but in my experience most were difficult to work with. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the set pace they had. The easiest part of the job was keeping track of the time you were there.
good,Amazon provides a great service for seller and buyer. I would recommend working for Amazon as a small or big business interested in online retail.

I work the overnight shift and the shifts are 10 hours. Amazon is the best warehouse job I have ever worked at. The warehouse is clean,employee benefits are plenty and everything is provided for the employees. Including heat warmers for the shipping area, medicine and care, tissues, water, cable TV in the break areas and security. Employees are often giving rewards for attendance and for work efficiency. The most difficult part for me is the long travel getting to work and going home from work. I enjoy the work and working with my fellow co-workers. Most of my experience has been from other warehouse jobs and I have worked at Amazon in the past. But this is the first time I have worked with the shipping area."

good,"Once arrived in the building you head to your locker to lock up any personal belongings because you cannot bring it on the floor. Then you go to your department and stretch and have a meeting. Once assigned to your job function you log on under your name so they can keep track of your hours. I'm currently in the pantry department and one of my favorite jobs is to pick. My department also deals with the robots also known as a kiva. In the process of picking, the computer gives you the orders you have to pick for the customers. You select the boxes and pick the items then you send the box down the conveyor belt to get packed. Teamwork is a key factor working at amazon, from receiving to shipping, everyone works together to meet the customers needs."
good,great benifits and people not much break time though pickers should be compensated more
good,Amazon.com is one of the best companies that I have ever worked with. The company ensures that there is work and there is entertainment for its employees that will keep them fresh through out their shift. A random day at work would include doing the assigned tasks and then there would be some games on the floor and on a random day there would be a DJ playing music on the floor while you work. The other staff at work is exceptional and they are all friendly and they make sure that you never get stuck at anything. There was nothing like a hard part of the job because there were always supervisors available on the floor to help us. Most enjoyable part of the job was the fun while you earn concept that the company has  implemented for its employees.

good,"A typical day at work includes a lot of versatility and multitasking. What I've learned is ways to better production inside Amazon as well as problem solving skills in a fast paced environment where you have to make the decisions in a quick and timely manner. I work with all different types of people and have learned how to cooperate with different personalities, as well as communicating effectively with different types of people. The hardest part of this job is you have to be a quick learner and fast paced as well as doing a safe and quality job. I have enjoyed the challenge very much and it has helped better me as a worker and a person. I enjoy knowing at the end of the day I have made a difference and have helped better the company I'm working for. I enjoy teaching classes and teaching people how to drive the forklifts we use at Amazon and giving them the confidence to do so.  I take pride in any job or task I take on, and I'm looking to find something more challenging in the future management oriented."

good,"I love staying constantly busy and this was the place to keep me on my toes...never a boring slow day here. I learned to work in a team at amazon. Everything required teamwork. Management was sweet and they were always willing to get their hands dirty when the warehouse got busy. My co-workers were so much fun to work with and always willing to help out one another. The hardest part definitely had to be the hot summers and the cold winters, being that there was no heater or AC. The best part was the awesome benefits package that Amazon offers."
good,"Very Fast Paced Job, Fun to work."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Amazon. I met amazing people while there. My department was very close, we were more like family. My lead was fantastic and very helpful. Team work was necessary, we detected the health of the building by cycle counting."
good,I recently got hired at this company i am looking forward to a new experience like seeing all the positive reviews and comments makes me look forward to it even more wish me luck as for all the negative reviews and comments it only takes 1 person to make a positive difference in this world and being negative isn't helping others or making work anymore enjoyable than it already is
good,"Hi-tech, but Hi-touch.  Its the people that make the Amazon machine run.  Building the relationships with the associates and coming together as a team to achieve challenging goals, while maintaining a safe work environment was extremely rewarding."
good,"Across my vast spectrum of different job titles I amassed many new skills and ways of thinking outside the box in many areas. A typical work day would include forecasts of daily goals and expectations, workforce alignment and daily walk throughs with upper management. I enjoyed every minute there and adapted well to the seemingly daily changes and growths that Amazon  adapted as a part of a bigger picture."
good,"It was a brilliant experience, it allowed me to display and utilise my skills but furthermore it enabled me to learn new skills and knowledge which could be further applied to the job. I would recommend it to anyone wanting work experience."

good,Amazon metrics drive wholesalers to satisfy the Amazons brand promise
good,Amazing company to work for. Hard work but fun and never a dull moment.
good,"A typical day at work would be spent picking items off of shelves around the warehouse to be shipped out to customers, or packaging the items to be shipped out to the customers. At this job I learned the whole warehouse process."
good,"In amazon there are many different tasks that are to be done. Some days I Simple bin which is going onto the floor and counting the product in each individual bin. There is also Adhoc's which is when you count each bin but you have to scan each individual item to make sure that the product is both physically and virtually in the bin. I am also trained as a problem solver which allows us to go onto the floor to follow the counters and fix any problems they may find with the bins; such as multiple scannable barcodes, missing barcodes,  ambiguous asin, and etc. There is also Audits. We have to make sure that the bins are being stowed accurately so we do stow audits if someone did not meet the expectation we have to let our manager know. The management at amazon is fairly good the communication could be a little better when it comes to overtime but besides that management is good at keeping everyone organized and on task. The work at amazon is a group effort everything ties into one another simple bin ties into adhocs when they miscount the number of pieces, adhocs then goes to the bin and scans each product and occasionally they have an issue with the bin so they pull an andon for the problem solver to come out and fix it so they can count the bin in the next round.  To me the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that it is fast paced and you get to communicate to your coworkers to assure that the job is being done right."
good,"A typical day at work would be first reporting to a stand-up meeting where our managers tell us pertinent information about the department and company. I've learned a lot about how a top fulfillment center works with their various processes.  The management is uplifting, energetic and great to work with. The managers really want to see their associates succeed. My co-workers are courteous and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is making rate when some of the other departments are behind in their processes. The most enjoyable part of the job is hanging out with co-worker friends on breaks and lunches. Overall, it's been a very good work experience."
good,fun place great people nothing bad good hours nothing bad to say

good,"I worked nights for Amazon ,the work was fast and you had to use your judgement at times because during the Christmas rush it was fast and you needed to be alert and make sure your job was done correctly and to the company strict ways ,I learnt lots while there it was a good experience and you had to be always alert for  mistakes made by the products damaged or the wrong type .,so the customer and the company during the time I worked there had a good production from me and the customer had there item of purchase packed safely and secure ."
good,"very hard at first but things get easier ,the only bad thing is you dont really know if youll be kept after your time"
good,"Uma ótima empresa para trabalhar. É uma empresa que incentiva os funcionários a terem  responsabilidades,dedicação."

good,"A very diverse work environment. There was no real challenging part about this job, everything was easy to grasp. I enjoyed the management as well as the co workers."
good,Provided customer service via telephone remotely from residence. I learned the back ground of Amazon. Their mission is to provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was not meeting the quota of customer calls in the day. I loved providing great customer service and problem solving so at the end of the phone call the customer was happy. Every communication was through the phone since the job was home based.
good,I would go and pick orders ready to be carted to packing. I would also every now and then go through to packing and pack an order ready to be shipped away. I got on really well with all my co-workers and boss's. it was a long day but I always enjoyed it.
good,"Empresa com colegas de trabalhos companheiros."
good,"It was a fast pace job always something new, great work environment. The hours were decent as well as pay, loved the 4 day work week gave plenty of off time for family."
good,it was a great experienced and they care about their employees health.
good,"its a good job easy to learn and co-workers are great"
good,"I liked working here, but getting yelled at by every customer wasn't fun. I was kinda thrown into the call floor quickly and felt I lacked knowledge of the company and what I was doing."
good,finding space for boxes and placing them in Bins. We also had rates per hour to maintain on the job. Our shifts could change depending on how many items we receive.
good,"On a typical day at Amazon, I would be loading product onto trucks to be sent out for for shipment. Being the fastest truck loader on the job, I would usually help train new employees and help other co-workers whose lines were getting backed up so that every order could make the shipment on time. This taught me how to work with a team and a little bit of leadership. My manager made everyday worth while coming into work because he would listen to problems to help solve them and make jokes regularly to help boost moral. Overall I loved the workout the job gave and the fact that I was good at what I did."
good,Good leadership values and smart technical solutions. Many opportunities to grow and implement innovative ideas.
good,"i just wanna go to work and get work done, its good, and always busy and your constantly working"
good,It was a wonderful place to work. A very nice facility and job atmosphere.  The training was very beneficial and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the customers were rude.

good,"Things were always changing. If you didn't adapt fast, you fell behind. it was an exciting time to be a part of the company."
good,I would like to work somewhere where I have to communicate with people.
good,"it was an intense job,you would be standing all day, lifting heavy boxes nonstop, very helpful co-workers"
good,Amazon is a very nice and friendly environment to work in. Working at amazon gives me the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds.
good,I learned a lot about as this was my first job as a customer service agent. My co-workers are the best part of being at work as they make your time at work bearable as you spend majority of the time at your second home and family. The internet was always accessible and games centre made it fun on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was being on seasonal contract and not getting the opportunity to stay longer as they only converted a handful of candidates at the end of the seasonal peak.
good,"Achieving day to day targets, Problem solving skill, Fun filled but very productive environment, various cultures, decision making, performance notified."
good,"This job was most demanding. A typical day consisted of 10-hour long shifts, consistent walking and standing, filling customer orders, sorting packages for shipping, and daily training classes."
good,Awesome people to work with. I learned a lot about c++/java/software design there.
good,"Was cross trained in various departments including Retail, Amazon Web Services, and Simple Email Services. Also fine tuned correspondence with customers remaining confidential when needed."
good,Quick-paced startup atmosphere. Don't work here if you're looking for a typical 9 - 5.
good,load-un-load amazon trucks seperate an prepare for shipping fill all orders in timely fashion
good,"Excellent Job, Good pay for nights starting at 13.50. Fast pace, Good staff and security. But its only seasonal."
good,Going to work was enjoyable. The employees I worked with made work fun! It is a fast working pace. You have to do a lot of walking and bending. Time goes by very fast. You get 15 minute breaks every two hours. Stretching and safety is very important to Amazon. You meet up at the beginning of your shift and at the end of your lunch breaks.
good,"did a little bit of everything in the building"
good,I enjoyed working in this facility the people are really nice and time flew everyone was cooperative and reliable. the managers were laid back if you were hard working. the hardest part was standing 10 to 12 hours straight. 
good,"We work hard, have fun and make history at Amazon."
good,"great company, great people, very smart, high-impact work, great work benefits, the list goes on"
good,A big company with being expected to work 50 - 60 hour weeks.  Being cross trained in every position in your department and in others is required if you expect to last at the company.
good,"Competitive and Challenge Atmosphere"
good,"decent pay, very fast pace and good job if you like to stay really busy majority of the time "
good,All of my co workers and supervisor were a pleasure to work with.
good,"I've learned how to run my business from soup to nuts all while working in a fun, challenging, and rewarding environment. Best part? I can bring my dog to work!"
good,"Clocking in and going to picking meetings twice a day, learned to use RF scanner, management was helpful in answering any questions, meeting new people that I was trained with."
good,Typical day is running around constantly filling a tote with items to fill orders. You get to see new stuff that comes out which is a plus.
good,"Starting out on our first day our manager grouped us into a room and basically told us he was ""hands-off"". He instructed us the scope of the job and let us get to work. The job was self explanatory and I believe I was the top producer in my department (along with my twin brother who worked with me at the time). The hours were flexible and really laid back."
good,amazon is a great company to work for with a very friendly staff. management was easy to talk to .the most enjoyable part of the job was reporting to work every day .learned how to work in a diverse environment I also learned to accept constant change. my co workers were always really nice and lots of fun.
good,The managers and co-workers are great. It is a heavy work load during the holidays with extra over time.
good,Loved working here! I was able to manage my own schedule of projects. I loved having a list of designs to create and knowing the deadline and specs spelled out for you. There's always cool stuff going on around Amazon - you can even bring your dog to work!
good,it was a great work place i really enjoyed it there an the people i worked with the hardest part was the distance you had to walk but all in all a very good job
good,got a lot done working for amazon and learned different systems to use when shipping and receiving orders also pulling and picking
good,tres bonne entreprise .très bonne ambiance de travail
good,I really enjoyed working at Amazon. It was very productive and effective workplace. All my co-workers got along great!!!There really wasnt a hard part of the job to me. The most enjoyable part was working for a company that really appreciated their workers and the work we put forth each and every day.
good,"loved the fast paced work enviroment, i learned how to sort, scan and put certain products in certain bins to be shipped out."
good,"A typical day at amazon was to count what was stowed. I learned a lot because I did not work in a warehouse before and it was a learning experience. I enjoyed it very much. I had no issues with management in fact they were very helpful. The co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was the bending,stooping,and walking for this warehouse was the size of 3 football fields. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the people you worked with."
good,"Although I was not hired permanently, it was a good experience and very upbeat positive attitude kind of business. Absolutely huge warehouse setting kept order pickers really moving all over the place. Machine operator is more my background but not available at the time."
good,"A typical day at work is great. We have freedom to truly help customer without going to ""the big guy."" Work place is fun, co workers are very helpful & willing to give a hand."
good,"Everyday, 10 hours of being on foot, moving up and down a huge warehouse at a quick and reasonable pace, with 50+ pounds of totes on a cart, to stock items on shelves. I've learned to work under a goal oriented based job, meaning everyday was the pressure of meeting the companies particular quantity rate by the hour. Being that i am a quick learner, it became an easy task, and it was rather fun to me. Management was strict, but in that type of work based environment, it was understandable. They were all about getting the job done. Co-workers that I surrounded myself with, all shared the goal of who can move the most units per hour by then end of the day, but we only spoke on our breaks and checking our rates by the hour. It made it fun for us. Nothing really difficult about the job, very simple task, you just have to be built to work in that environment. Great job."
good,This position requires walking up to atleast 10-15 miles a night. it requires picking of merchandise for customers.
good,enjoyed working there managers were great hours were ok early mornings getting up at 3.30 am werent so great but all in all really enjoyed
good,"Working a ten hour shift, standing on my feet the entire shift shipping and packaging customers orders.I learned that productivity is important and customers are always first. My co workers and I were always keeping eachother motivated."
good,"great place, great hours, loved working there but was a bad time on my part"
good,"A typical day at an Amazon.com call center varied depending on what division you worked in. I liked a more challenging day so I started out on a team that handled multiple divisions. I quickly learned all the ins and outs of the different divisions and after some time, began working with the corporate business teams in Seattle to bridge the communications gap between business and customer service. Working at Amazon taught me a whole new level of customer service and self-empowerment."
good,I worked at Sears as a seasonal worker and enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot more about retail business. Management was great as well as coworkers.
good,i love working here at theis job and love what i do. i do alot of computer work and training.
good,"A very good company to work for and good benefits. A very customer centric company, goes out of the way to take care of customer expectations."
good,"I enjoyed working at the amazon warehouse it was a great work environment with great employees. I learned alot about how amazon operates and alot about shipping,, the job was fairly easy"
good,"picking orders ( books,cds,dvds) for the customers and distributing them according their code or number and loading them in truck"
good,Typical call center day - 50-70 calls.
good,"I liked the energy, everyone was vey positive all the time, the managers were motivating and always had ansers to questions. Very fast-paced and days went by fast."
good,good company and great supervisor treats you really good other employees are ok
good,nice place to work in. i had fun there. they play music as you work so that helps the day go by faster.
good,"Fully supportive mgmt team. Good pay, benefits, and extras such as health fairs, free flu shots, etc."
good,"The job is of a delivery driver can be stressful and dispatch aren’t very helpful "
good,"Armazon no maneja un estándar de seguridad y salud ocupacional con sus colaboradores, no hay cultura de seguridad en el trabajo,  los colaboradores trabajan desordenados."
good,The job was good enough to get on with I enjoyed working there the people are really nice and helpful if your ever stuck everyone comes together as a team I would recommend applying.
good,"taking calls and assisting customers with different issues"
good,"Very fast paced, could get very unorganized at times. Many seasonal associates at the time weren't getting routes for the day, after being on time and in dress code at the stand up meetings in the mornings."
good,"Micromanage ALL the time"
good,like the job supervisor's and workers had lot`s of things to do felt good about my jobs done was always met by positive job influence was always treated politely
good,The pay is good but this place tries to rotate people out of the job instead once they reach too high of a level. This place pay makes you feel better about your finances until they fire you out of nowhere for something very small. They are a great environment but the less people they pay the more they can keep for themselves while recruiting more people to do it too.
good,Was the best and worst place I ever worked I would get hotels so I could be at work but when ever I couldn't be there because of the weather and unsafe roads they just didn't care
good,I enjoyed working for Amazon the paste was very fast but efficient. My co workers were awesome and they would help me if I needed it. The only problem was the commute
good,"Great experience pertaining to customer service and how to effectively and efficiently solve problems in regards to prime student accounts. It was tons of fun creating events for students to come and engage at, and tested my organization and time management skills."
good,"Working at Amazon is great, depending on the mangers you receive everything else is excellent. In some buildings there’s a lot of cut throat business, hate, jealousy but that’s how you know your doing  something GOOD!!!"
good,I think the company is okay I guess I mean ight or whatever it good while it lasted.would I go back? No not really. At least the pay is good at least . Make that money I guess.
good,"warehouse environment, good workout, long shirts, good people. Always had help when needed, morning meetings to ensure daily job duties to have a productive day"
good,"I don,t recommend working they fired me for medical reasons i was in the hospital and they fired me. Amazon is not for the lazy people it hard to work for them its easy to get a job with them."
good,Nice place to work. Good shift patterns. Friendly enough people. Nice and fast paced. Good exercise. Competitive pay. Would recommend to anyone looking to earn a bit of money.
good,Peccato che sono stata inserita nel picco e una volta segnata con loro non ti riassumono più. Questa è una vera e propria atrocità non poter dare un’altra possibilità ad una persona che ha già lavorato in quest’azienda solo perché servivo solo per il picco poiché tutti i manager erano entusiasti del mio lavoro. Questa e la vera PECCA.
good,Amazon was working environment was really nice I liked working there and the staff was so respectful and polite to work with and also the job type in it’s self was quite simple
good,"I enjoyed my time at amazon. I was able to learn a lot of new skills such as driving forklift, working with there computer systems. The working conditions were fast paced but still remained comfortable. The benefits were excellent."
good,Most of the people are friendly. Apply for the Blue Badge once you are eligible. There is room for advancement. Also there are opportunities to work in other states in the US by transferring to other locations around the world.
good,"My experience as an Amazon associate was great. Unfortunately I attend community college as a nursing undergrad it just wasn’t for me at the time, I have a lot of studying to do so I need a part time job"
good,Stressante ma divertente la notte vola veloce sala relax molto attrezzata
good,"Amazon is a good solid job if you are looking to work hard and get a lot of hours.  If you do your job, you will be able to stay employed.  Overall, I am pleased."
good,"Ottimo ambiente di lavoro, ottimi colleghi, sicurezza non ne manca. Ma gli stipendi fanno un po desiderare."
good,"management was the biggest issue here.  they really have a high demand and will fire you for just going to the restroom. I spent 6 years thee, because a ""project manager""  and they never gave me a raise or actual promotion, but I still gave them my insight and helped develop several tools, systems and new ideas to help drive customer service while maintain a low cost effectiveness approach, to a wide verity of facilities that eventually went world wide and saved the company millions. and at the end?  I headed the projects, built them from the ground up …. and not only was I never offered a promotion, but my ideas where stolen from me and given to other employees with no experience and used to promote them instead. and my name was never mentioned... I was the creator of all of it, and  my fellow coworker, the ones I trained, all got promotions. this lead to my submission of my resignation and I forfeited my involvement with them and moved on"
good,"I didn't work directly with Amazon, I worked for them through 3rd party company. Amazon employees were very judgmental of my job as if they were better than me and my coworkers since we were the cleaners."
good,Amazon was a fun experience fair in the pay for what you worked fast past for a short time and relaxed afterwards good place to work definitely will want to work there again
good,Everyday is the same fast pace meet deadlines and management is there to help the only bad thing is moving up the company ladder but exteremly fun the first year
good,"You need to accept a block with the time and criteria provided, you need to hit go to station in order for the gps to start guiding you towards your pickup location when arriving you have to check arrive and scan your id."
good,"Great work atmosphere. Beautiful campus with restaurant-like cafeteria, gym, dry clearner, clinic, bank, walking paths, security. Flexible hours. Frequent opportunities for community involvement and onsite learning. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming."
good,I am a flex associate and to be totally honest it’s not all that beneficial unless you are a set employee. All the benefits and stuff don’t really apply to you as a flex associate. I just began working there and I hope they offer opportunities to extend my time in the company.
good,Working with Amazon don't have to be completely fit but you must be able to lift packages of up to 75 lb. It is hot in the summertime it is warm in the winter. Amazon is time management or innate it there's no sitting there's no time wasted you do have the option to leave early if all work is done.
good,"While working for Amazon I worked in 3 areas. Fresh, fulfillment, Prime Now. I enjoyed management and the environment. Very fast paced and challenging. A good way to keep in shape."
good,Really good company to work for.. Sanning packages unto the pallet to later be wrapped up and staged for pick up to be delivered.. Amazon is awesome.. Easy work with decent enough pay..
good,Get used to overtime! Great benefits and lots of different jobs! Meet lots of new people and management is helpful at times. Paid school and opportunity for advancement
good,"It’s convenient and it’s work, lots of things can be better, but it works for me. Would like to move up in the company. Good thing, they are all over the world"
good,Amazon was a good job if you have what it takes to do the job. It is hard work but the pay is good and the benefits are amazing. You also get raises as well as long as you stay.
good,Amazon is a nice place to work but it’s management that’s there that don’t care about the employees that work there so that’s why it has a lot of people coming and going if the head person in charge go to his work places and found of for him self he would see because he don’t know what we go through on a daily basis working for him with hismanagement teams team
good,Amazon is a great place to learn new skills to be more productive with your time. They also have a competitive but fun work place that makes you wanna keep going beyond your goals. In my position at Amazon I got to learn new skills by taking on different tasks some day to day.
good,"Amazon is amazing. I was fortunate to work there if only for a short time. The pace is intense, the desire for immediate results unrelenting, My skills were a great match, I enjoyed the culture, as well as my team, but in the end, the lack of work/life balance was not an expense I was prepared to endure."
good,I really enjoyed working here. They made it feel comfortable almost like you weren’t at work. The calls could be intense but the leads made sure to remind us we were appreciated.
good,amojon is the biggest and secure company..and all the costumar feel profit and good for goods...i also feel good..l work in this company for my study.
good,"Self-care is vital to avoid burnout. Do lots of lower-back exercises. but all in all great for staying in shape. You might get sent home after you arrive for your shift if they booked too many people. However, if you're one of the best workers, you've got nothing to fear. You will know if you're on the chopping blocks. It's straight forward, you know what you're getting into. if you can't hack it, you're out."
good,If you need to work multiple jobs and you need weird hours that can be filled by other jobs amazon flex works wonders on the basis of hours when you schedule them.
good,"Worked as a fulfillment associate for Prime Now. It is fast paced and competitive, from choosing the hours you want to work to how quickly you can complete orders. Most of the time the manager wasn’t present, so we had to self manage which made the atmosphere pleasant to work in."
good,"You're pushed to work hard to meet targets but I did not find this difficult to achieve. "
good,La verdad es que yo sólo digo que yo iba a trabajar y me encantaba trabajar ahí.
good,"this is a fast pace job, it can be tiresome, you will have to be able to tolerate walking a lot which includes walking up stairs as well and able to lift some heavy orders"
good,"daily stretching was performed while managers told us of daily goals to meet. Then had 30 seconds to get handheld scanner and start stowing materials. I met the daily stow rates quickly, and was asked to report to receiving lines for inbound frieght. Met the daily rates there and continued in receiving until the day my seasonal temp job expired. i would have loved to stay and work for ever. i loved the fast paced enviornment and good pay."
good,si lavora sempre contenti e i tuoi superiori ti motivano per lavorare sempre meglio
good,fun workplace had to leave because  I relocated upstate for college. It is a good job because you get paid weekly. However sometimes it is overwhelming.
good,préparation de commandes des clients commandant en ligne
good,"it was a place to make good friends, and they had some good employee days that made it fun to go to.  when managers changed positions tho, it was hard to fit into their expectations because they were always different than the boss before!"
good,"Overall the job is nice I would say that the labor is pretty hard... self explanatory. A lot of individuals would like it,a lot wont. If youre morning person,then the job might not be for you."
good,"Amazon’s mission is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company where people can find and discover anything they want to buy online. "
good,The work there was fulfilling and was easy to meet goal as long as you were actually working. The shift leaders were generally very helpful and easygoing.
good,"Amazon is hard work but I also really enjoyed working there, once you know what you have to do and don't have to do it is a wonderful place to work. You just have to get used to the night shifts and the amount of walking that you do. I enjoyed working with different types of people and would go back if I could."
good,"I liked the managers that I dealt with there. But there was too much walking as a picker. They need a better system for pickers to pick in just a certain area, instead of having to walk all over the whole warehouse or the dept they're in that shift. Should be more narrowed down, then they wouldn't have the huge turnover they have from people's feet, back and legs wearing out on them."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante, lavoro ben remunerato e soddisfacente, attivo, a contatto con il pubblico"
good,the manager sucked and where unprofessional they didnt get there system together they where always down the breaks where short and not long enough and they work you like your a slave
good,"Although I only worked during the peak season, it was a really interesting place to work. You meet soo many people with different cultures, ethnicities, and everyone there is friendly and eagar to help out when needed! I will truly miss my time spent here and look forward to the next peak season this year!"
good,The hardest part was making sure you made it to your goal by the end of the shift. The two fifteen minutes went by like five. There was one thirty minute that felt like a fifteen.
good,"A typical day at work would be just arriving and having a few minutes to set up and would have to take calls."
good,"Don’t get comfortable , you are no more than a number there. You are expendable so don’t get used to being there it will end soon. Lunch breaks are too short!"
good,"Fast paced enviroment that will definitly make sure your always active and moving , great staff and friendly management and hr team, as I seenhey care for the wokers"
good,You have to get use to it. It's high pace and ye so you have to get use to the work load and the change in the are of your work place but over all its alot of work
good,"Amazon was a great place to work, Amazon test each employee before hiring and it turns out to be such a great assessment that they get great employee's who pull and work together to get the job done. It was truly a team driven experience. We pulled together at a Whole Food Store. And filled on-line orders. The only draw back is that Amazon does not give you a schedule. They post schedule openings on-line and it is a first grab first get situation. So unless you have the latest iPhone you  may not get much time on the schedule. I was only able to get a day or two every two weeks."
good,"I enjoyed working there, I just didn’t like how slowly I moved up. The pay was great but the people weren’t. All in all it was a great opportunity. I encourage anyone to apply"
good,"This place is a good place to go and work and get a nice steady rate of money weekly, with very little stress unless you are uncomfortable with fast paced work."
good,I think it's a great company and they care about their employees .. they do very good training for all their employees .. the problem is that they give very few hours of work
good,Amazon is a great place for people who love to see their ideas become a product. It doesn't have as many meetings as some other places I worked for. I enjoyed working there.
good,I am a part time employee and have no health insurance and am having a serious tooth problem that is causing me lots of pain. This is why I am seeking a potition where I could still be involved with amazon but still be able to keep a roof over my head while taking care of my dental issue.
good,"A challenging place to work, but also offers great opportunities for their employees who want to advance. They also offer a way to change careers by providing their employees ""career Choice"" , which is education in a different industry other than working at Amazon."
good,"The good:"
good,"Face paced and easy to move up. Management helps to develop you, and you are pushed to be top of the line. The hours are long, but the benefits are amazing"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon. Picking was my job title at the beginning, but unfortunately I got injured while working. Then I got switched to a Counter."
good,"I'm ready to move forward with my career and advance only reason I'm leaving, wonderful company. Just ready for more. Always very nice and always have site events for employees."
good,"It's a warehouse, you'll be doing warehouse work. I think Amazon in particular catches a lot of unfair judgement just because they hire anyone. It's available almost anywhere and really easy to get in. At the end of the day the warehouse industry probably has the highest turnover rate out of any other job field, not just Amazon. I actually found the job to pay fairly well for the workload. In my opinion though the work/life balance is too hard to maintain full time. Maybe if it paid a bit better, or if it were 48 hour weeks instead of 40 hour weeks the money would be worth slaving away at another warehouse."
good,"The breaks are too short, the rates are too strict and the work in general is very stressful, but the pay makes up for all of that. I would go back only for the money."
good,"Good pay but that job physically kicks your butt loooooong hours to work on your feet, if you arent physically fit pls dont waste your time in applying"
good,"Ambiente lavorativo buono. Musica nei reparti e dinamicita'"
good,"This has to be one of my favorite jobs I've ever had. It was a lot of fun and a lot of hard work but I really enjoyed it, just wish it was longer then 4 hours to make it easier to making  a living off of."
good,"alright place to be and also flexible enough to attend school"
good,"Excesiva carga de trabajo, sin embargo buenos equipos de trabajo"
good,"the day flows by nicely because you have plenty to do, I learned how to stow and how to improve my communication and social skills, the management there treats you very kindly, the workplace culture is fun and diverse, the hardest part of the job was being on your knees a lot and the most enjoyable part was raising my stowage percentage."
good,"to start is a good company, competitive and personal development. gives the opportunity to all people. give you the opportunity to go to school and giving you monetary help."
good,"It was a great experience for me as I was able to meet new friends and new faces while being able to progress myself and be the best that I can be. The breaks are very well, the break room has everything you might need far as heating and a place to store your food, and by the faithfulness of your work, you can be getting paid more."
good,"I worked night shift for extra pay, and worked four 10 hour shifts a week. Three days off is nice, but it is difficult to flip your sleep schedule around on your days off. Work days pretty much consisted of just work for me, though some will be able to avoid that. "
good,"All and all its a good place to work and build a great retirement for your family , and you get to work with a lot of great people and work in a nice and clean enviroment"
good,"E' stata un'esperienza nuova , ma coinvolgente a livello personale."
good,"It was a temporary job so I didn't mind the long hours and short breaks. It helped me as a team member. I learned about how the manufacturing and shipping distribution center worked. I learned what factory type of work is like in a competitive environment with heavy equipment, conveyor belts, forklifts, and thousands of people all working for timely and quality delivery of products to valued customers."
good,"If you like a face-paced, competitive warehouse job then I suggest Amazon is a great place for you to apply. Management isn't to much of a help; you have to speak up."
good,the job helped me increase my pace. Workers are prone to illness and there is no much to show for it. This can be good for others but not too good for me because i go to school to further my IT career by the side
good,Good place to work. But depends in a process it has to be more easy for the employees. Strict rules but easy dress code. Periodic employee appreciations.
good,Amazon was a very competitive job. At the end I started looking for another job. The upcoming work week projections were too much for me to handle with school and home life but would definitely recommend the job.
good,"besides being the company know to be headed by the richest human in history, im not sure about anything else. I did not talk to a single human until the first day i started working. everything was handled through email. and a promise regarding job security was broken. Review it is okay while it last. Dont get comfortable you will get laughed while a supervisor is laughing about it over the phone."
good,"The day usually started with stretching to insure that associates were well prepared for a 10 hour day on their feet. Rate driven work provided for a somewhat competitive environment, although quality was of the utmost importance."
good,Easy job learned everything quick. Hours are super short so didn’t get payed much but the good benefit was that we get paid every Friday besides that a fun place to work.
good,Self motivated individuals will have good time. You will have every resource required to learn new technology except time. Difficult not to get lost in daily tasks.
good,"Working at Amazon was a good experience. It was ten hour days on your feet and fast passed. I drove an Oder Picker which was pretty enjoyable to operate. I was the youngest warehouse employee so I never developed a work relationship with anyone, but they seemed like nice people."
good,Good team work fast pace great work enviornment made good friends best at safety. Break room is big .when we get to work we streatch first to make sure we dont pull something or get soar from all the walming and standing.
good,I do not like the rotation of jobs it will be 39 years doing Safety and here I have to work nights while people just out of collage get to work days. My manager is never here and when he is he does not deal with problems very well. All I seam to do is paper work and he keeps adding more paper work I do not feel that my safety skills are being used and that is why this is a very boring job.
good,It is very good opportunities to work with seniors. Their was lot many things to learn like development automation of the process and management is very very great to  accept and implement your Ideas when you give your ideas.
good,It was a good place really enjoyed working and i've learn a lot sorting mail and packages and the peoples are very friendly and respectful and easy to talk with.
good,they have good benefits with good pay. and good hours and they bring us food from other places and help us learn new things that no other warehouse would have taught us.
good,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment."
good,"career choice program allows you to enroll in classes for other professions after a year of employment. the classes cost $3,000.00 and amazon pays 95% of that up front! who else does that? they give out stock after 2 yrs"
good,"une bonne entreprise très bonne ambiance super travail, je travailler de nuit alors financièrement super bien"
good,"Amazon is always changing. Every single day is a new adventure. Working here introduces you to the most interesting people, and you learn so much from this. Depending on your role and the building you work in, you can typically spend 10+ hours per shift. Customer obsession is amazon's motto, and it is what we are instilled with every day we go to work."
good,Amazon is a place where you have no time for error but that's what makes them effective. Amazon was one of the job you can have love and hate relationship with.
good,I loved working for Amazon.com - the training is excellent; the staff very knowledgeable and willing to help you if you have problems. The only reason I gave a 1 star is because I don't know what the Compensation/benefits and Job Security/Advancement is with the company since I was hired for seasonal work. I assume they have great benefits because some of their full time staff started out as a seasonal customer service representative.  The Job Work / Life Balance was excellent! I was able to work the hours I needed and all the employees were offered overtime.
good,"Abbastanza soddisfatto, ambiente gradevole, pulito,organizzato, igene,ambiente frenetico.puasa troppo corta.."
good,"I liked working at this company.  Wish it were a permanent position, but it was temporary.  It was something I enjoyed doing and it was convenient by being close to my home and the work hours were good too."
good,"There is no direct management so you must be a self starter. However, managers are willing to help you out when possible. Job is fun and relaxed, even when it is fast-paced."
good,The workers and manager were always helpful and positive. The hardest part of the job was making the numbers for the day of your productivity and the most enjoyable part was working with the people.
good,Its an ok company with great values. Its a fast paced environment. On a typical day at work we are assigned to a specific area to work for that day i.e truck or sorting
good,"the work at amazon was not hard. you just have to want to be there, the hardest part is showing up. i actually loved working there. lost the opportunity due to immaturity"
good,This was a temp job working in the warehouse logging returns that were sent back to the company that were unwanted or damaged.  Logging them on the computer system.
good,Great place to work at pretty fast pace great benefits personal time vacation time unpaid time they will pay for you to go to school after one year with the company
good,Working at amazon was a good Experience I liked everything about it unpacking and stockinhg is my favorite The job isn't hard to do. It's very easy once you put your mind to it. The managers are very kind and stand by you step by step until you understand your position. I feel comfortable in the environment and love the co-workers.
good,"Amazon has a great benefits package and there is room for growth if your are willing to put in the time and effort to prove yourself. Associates get a lot of incentives and have a great break room with flat screens, computers, basketball machines etc. The work can be repetitive but you can cross train frequently to add more value to yourself."
good,The shift I worked was added-on during the 2016 holiday season December through January only. Good place to work and during the busy season had plenty of different tasks we were asked to do. Kept it interesting. People there were great. They even had a 10 minute drill before each shift to get people loose and stretched before doing any lifting or bending. The only problem I had was working only 2 to 4 hours a shift.
good,This company has a great deal of benefits for all permanent employees. It will also keep you in very good shape! Great pay for what you do. This is not a job for the slow moving people.
good,"Travail agréable, bonne ambiance cependant, on ne laisse pas les chances aux bonnes personnes.. Pas de possibilités d'évolution."
good,"Awesome place to work. If you are planning on join Amazon, Don't watch the documentary on Amazon because it has changed a lot. Managers are friendly and will help you out as much as they can. The targets are easy to hit as long as you put the effort in. The only downside to Amazon is the agencies that work with them. PMP and Transline are both terible. However if you are going to join one, go with PMP."
good,"Part time worker, heavy lifting, coworkers are lazy but they are the ones with a permanent position and doesn't have to work as hard as other coworkers"
good,"Its a nice place to work the company just get bought alot threw different companies ,and have to be able to keep up with other and meet your Numbers all the time"
good,"decnt place to work good banter , nice place , good people , easy to get too , round the corner for me , go in sort parcels , promotion straight away ,"
good,Fun place to work with flexibility.  Nice break room for the associates.  Great work incentives provided during the busy season.
good,I had a good time their how brief it was because of agencies wot I worked for as soon as I was trained one week before Xmas I was got rid of .
good,"Lack of a positive team culture, with a lack of a sense in job security. Poor feedback from management in what job advancements there are and support to achieve them."
good,Some days are super busy and stressful and some days are slow and fun. Because its a new building its a little rocky on management but everyone works together as a team and makes the job a better place
good,"Day starts at 0650 and ended typically no later than 1700, depending on the package count and route given. I learned about the delivery buisness. The management was overall friendly and were easy to talk to and work for. My co-workers were all nice and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was a few of the routes, but got used to them after a few times of going on them.The mot enjoyable part was being able to be mostly independent while out on a route."
good,Grate partime job big competition. It hard to get of hold of ani one when ever you ned help or have cuestiins al they do is email yuo generate email.
good,"A typical day at work: "
good,like amazon a lot the break room has video games and table games nice people and constantly meeting new people. young manager are more interested in talking to the girls instead of doing the right thing
good,"I mostly enjoy this job at amazon. "
good,"I liked my job, and the company.  However, the management was filled with young kids who had college degrees, but not much life experience.  It made it hard to fulfill my duties."
good,A wonderful place to work for those that live in the area. A fast paced setting at your own pace. A very physical job due to all the walking.
good,dinâmica trabalho em equipe e parceria de trabalho a parte mas difícil a falta comunicação entre a parte logística com parte de entrega
good,"i enjoyed working at amazon,managers and team leaders were fine,i met quite a few people while picking stock.there was alot of walking involved and bending down to pick from bottom shelf. i did enjoy working there and would go back ."
good,10 or more hour work day. Loading trucks and picking orders. I learned how to load ground trucks and I learned how to sort by volume. Also learned how to use shipping doc equipment. Management was helpful with training. Co-workers were also helpful.The long hours was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the employees and having steady income.
good,"A normal day as a packer, starts with ""stand up."" This is where everyone gets updates and at the end of the updates, we stretch. Before heading to our assigned stations. Once at our stations, we perform a readiness check to make sure we have every thing we need to do out job efficiently. Quick start is a must for all packers. To stay on rate you must get pack everything in your cage or cart in a fast pace. Each product must be scanned, place in a box, scan the spoo (barcode for that package), place it on the box and send it to the taper. "
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working in a friendly environment and working with others. the hardest part of this job would be carrying 40 - 50lbs daily, but this job was overall a great experience."
good,"We get a lot of customers daily. the job is off and on busy, the hardest part of the job is having short staff when very busy. overall i love the company and the coworker. i just love begin to be abke to help people."
good,"Great place to work for, but management needs improvement. Good hours, good pay, and great benefits. Hard working, fast pase, and full time hours."
good,It is a fun work place to work at.  Good people to talk to and to work with. If you are good worker there are more benefits. You will get free stuff and bonuses.
good,"The hours were challenging, but love the weekly pay! I would go back if it payed more. For anyone who wants a easy job apply there."
good,"In Inventory Control and Quality Assurance my role is fundamentally about driving quality within specified area through continuous process of improvements. This is accomplished through inventory cycle count, identifying defects, researching and analyzing the root cause of defects and determining the best way to eliminate future, and similar defects."
good,"A typical day work for amazon consisted of, handling phone calls from happy to out raged angry customers, Help keep customers and making others smile, My most favorite part of the day is handling the  angry customers, because they help make a good impact on customer relations when they leave happy."
good,"When starting a shift there would be a meeting where team leaders would tell us what needed to be achieved as target, I learned that in order to achieve the target we all had to work hard and give your best.  Management were very approachable for any reason,  I got on with all my co workers and made some new friend's, there was no hard part of the job as I really enjoyed my time working there the only statement I would make is the amount of time you got go and have food and be back for work. Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the people that I did co workers and team leaders."
good,"Great Pay, not very much work life balance. Good fast paced company overall"
good,Stored different shipments of toys and various items received from the customers of Amazon. Was responsible for all items that were received.
good,working at amazon was a very fast pace job but it kept me in shape
good,A typical night shift would include collecting items which came in from deliveries and my role was to arrange these items into their correct catagories. The hardest part of this job role was working towards the targets although I did achieve these. Overall Amazon was a good place to work as christmas temp.
good,"at first everyone was excited to have every one working there, but after a week or two it died down and there wasn't much work for anyone. They treated you alright in the beginning and then like trash"
good,"Handling high volume of e-mails and incoming calls, resolving customer enquires  and escalating further if necessary."
good,I learned to do a few different things and was trained in some different departments. i also had the opportunity to train a few peole as well. We had 10 hour days four days a week and I worked thirds so it didn't leave much for a social life. My co-workers were always helpful and supportive when needed. The hardest funtion I did within the company was stow and the one that I enjoyed the most was collating. The management was always there to answer questions and jump in if you needed the extra help.
good,"The job is really easy. Only thing is they have let go of some really great workers but have been rated on speed, instead of replacing them in a different job that may be a better fit for them, they fire them. Not everyone will be able to do a job as better as the next man but it don't mean they can't do another job better. Give them a chance to find what they are better at."
good,"Picked, packed, stowed, line-loaded & various other tasks"
good,i loved working amazon it was one of the coolest jobs i have. the only problem that i would say i had was the team lead wouldnt let us know a head of time that we where going to be working over time we would find out that same day. i also always asked to get trained on flork lifting driving and they never wanted to train anyone.
good,"e uma empresa que da oportunidade de crescimemto no seu cargo de trabalho ,eu nao tenho muito o que falar ,so digo que me deu uma oportunidade que nenhuma outra me daria ,me tirou da limpeza e me colocou na confeitaria sem nenhuma experiencia e me deu a chance de aprender"
good,"Era um excelente estágio, aprendi a lidar com pessoas e tive vasto conhecimento no ramo de informática, ótima direção."
good,"Had to work nights as a single packer, standing all night does hurt your feet for a while. I was working there as a temp through the Christmas period."
good,Satisfied with job. Working hour and working conditions were good. Also staff was very supportive and guided very well during early days to understand job.
good,"If you like working in a fast paced environment then this is the place you have been looking for. The work is good, co-workers are nice and it is fun working here."
good,I learned the importance of staying healthy and in shape working for Amazon. I also learned to look at the bigger picture and realize that every jib at amazon is the most important job. Every thing depends on another. It is important to work hard and overcome any obstacle standing im your path.
good,"alright, place but there are tons of improvements work starts early and has a 10.5-hour workday with 4 days on and 3 days off which is good but the workplace needs so many improvements."
good,"It's a nice place to learn, work life balance is OK too much politics and less hike but work satisfaction is there"
good,"Its fun just need better hours. Management is fine they listen, really clean facility, work can be tedious at times. Pay is fine just the hours are really underwhelming."
good,Si lavora in gruppo e si cerca sempre di migliorare personalmente
good,good place to work with good personal salary of humana resorce personal veery unpleasant the pay excellent but they do not offer you a permanet  position it is is difficult to get blue tranfer
good,"-Great learning"
good,It was great working with new people and feeling like I was included in everything the company had going on. The hours were great and the managers were very flexible when it came to balancing school and work.
good,"Early start, load vehicle with 150-200 packages.  Delivering packages to the customers as quick as possible."
good,"On time routes always and very good coworkers arround , expedites team to help at the driver all time and clean whearhouse .very nice and organiced seccions of routes prepairad in los angeles area and calculaded the time in each route evry day, yhe bad thing in the last month was they dont have to much time to work ."
good,The job is very strenuous and requires 5 days a week received 40 hours fast paced environment minimal supervision production is a must deliver anywhere from 100 to 200 packages a day
good,I would say it’s not for everyone but the benefits are good. Although the benefits could be better with more opportunities to progress and better management.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon. Com, Inc. It was good work and good exercise. I would suggest the job and company to others. I would work with Amazon. Com, Inc in the future."
good,Amazon.com is a fun work enviorment that is physically demanding and fast paced that I really enjoyed. I would love to join their company again if possible
good,Working at amazon was a good experience that included alot of walking and discipline to be maintain the rate to make sure we got customers orders out on time
good,"I was able to work from home, which was great, however the management needed to be trained prior to trying to train my team. Management was not helpful or able to assist very well. "
good,My experience at Amazon was very interesting and helpful
good,The job is there if you really want to work well then this is the place to work. If you come to this company to work well then prove your self to the employer.
good,A me è piaciuta peccato che é durata poco non capisco il motivo spero vivamente che mi richiamano. Ottime persone educate e gentili
good,"A typical day at work would include answering Customer Service calls until lunch(different times everyday) , I would then have lunch for no longer than an hour , thereafter I would return to answering calls and have 2 more 15 minute breaks until the end of my shift. Working at Amazon taught me that being yourself is an important aspect in your work environment , whilst maintaining a professional and attentive persona along side being comfortable, it enhanced my people skills and showed me how important proper communication truly is. The management at Amazon was very professional and accommodating in the sense of it being easy to communicate any indifferences or the need of assistance. Amazon's workplace culture was that of a relaxed and friendly type , I always felt comfortable presenting myself without judgement. While working at Amazon , I didn't face many challenges , although , adapting to frequent shift changes could pass as perhaps the hardest part of the job. What i enjoyed most , was the freedom to be and dress like myself and feel comfortable doing so , without being judged. I enjoyed the interactiveness amongst co-workers and a constant mutual willingness to work as a team."
good,"The company is an extremely fun place to work at, however, sometimes there are very inconvenient and regressive managers who are not rooted out easily. The company should do their best to keep such managers out of the company and work culture."
good,"People and management are wonderful but as far as workflow, it seems that they are working out alot of kinks as it is a fairly new location."
good,"Work with little to no supervision, promotions are encouragement. You are able to view your progress daily. You are being monitored; how long you spent on an order, did you substitute a missing product correctly."
good,"You should were comfortable shoes. Be prepared to Work, Learn and Listen. You will have company discount soon after your blue badge. Most important, Listen to your leadership they  know more than you. Great place to work at."
good,It was a great company to work for!  During the busy times of the year it’s hard to take care of any personal business when you are working 60 hours a week!
good,"Great place to work, management is very helpful and always gives great feed back, wonderful job benefits, clean and positive work environment, high moral"
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo y mucho compañerismo,yo he estado super agusto"
good,"È una grandissima realtà lavorativa, mi sono trovato benissimo personalmente."
good,I enjoy working with others and being part of a team. The time goes by very quickly and the Managers are very helpful. The schedule works very well for me.
good,Consiglierei questo lavoro ad amici e parenti perche' ho imparato moltissimo
good,Staff is nice and willing to answer questions. Some days are better that others depending on the amount of packages coming into the warehouse.  Comfortable shoes for walking are a must.
good,happy new year everyone. May this year full of joy and happiness. May god full fill everyone’s wishes and work hard in your life to get something. God is one.
good,"Healthy work environment amazing staff satisfactory compensation and benefits."
good,"fun workplace, how to enter merchandise into computers, for later sells, stocking, recording the places they were stored for later purchasing. My position at that time was called a storer"
good,"Very strict on attendence, I was in the hospital and ended up gettin fired because I was there’s 3 days longer than I thought I would be. Outside of that they are great to work for"
good,This was a good company to work for and great benefits they always made it fun they always had something fun for us at this company the manager was rude
good,"It's really easy work. Go in do your hours and leave, picking and stowing are the easiest tasks at a warehouse. Only the people make it difficult by not paying attention or by just walking around and not working. Some people will Pick 8+ routes while others only Pick 2 routes but still get paid the same. That's the biggest disadvantage, seems as if they don't even care when that happens. Just makes empty threats of write ups. Other wise fun and easy"
good,Excelllent  company  and I’m satisfied with there overall experience and letting me work this amazing company and I highly recommend them to anybody who needs a job
good,So competitive. But you get a lot to learn. Many helpful people to work with but the pressure is intense. Customers are often irate and that impacts your performance at times.
good,"Grab scanner and cart, begin a customers order then start searching for items in cold to hot temperatures in a fast paced all while maintaining a clean, safe and respectful environment. Drop off cart on drop off zone then start all over. Picking was easy for me, I always made rate and went higher than the average. Hardest part was the demand in wanting us to be speedy gonzalez fast."
good,Over all I was very pleased to work at Amazon not only because of the pay but due to the fact of the team members and the proper training Human resources also is very well with assisting in time checks and fixing your time sheet by the end of the second week
good,"E un bel posto di lavoro, un po stressante sotto alcuni punti di vista, ma conosci veramente tanta gente. Per il lavoro che c'è e i tempi che ti danno però lo stipendio e un po' bassino"
good,"Once you clock in , you will go to dispatch station and supervisors will talk to the group about your workload for the day.Then you do group stretches to get you lose for the job. Next dispatch hands out delivery routes to the drivers,then u go find your route then go load your van."
good,"Łatwa praca"
good,"They only have 1 script, and I had to use it once during a fire drill. Other then that, there are no scripts, if you need them to do customer service, you may want to look someplace else."
good,"They have decent pay"
good,"Management was always avail and great. Hours and days were flexible and they work with you for last minute emergencies. I worked from home so it was a comfortable environment, pay was decent for know travel time, and the responsibilities matches up to the job description."
good,"The work at Amazon is easy but strenuous. You will to be on your feet for 10 hours a day bending,  lifting and walking. The pay and benefits are really good. The benefits start day one also."
good,"I like the environment. It’s a great job, the balance of work and personal life is not the best. I’m a single father I spend most of my time at work and no time with my daughter. I work weekends, I would much rather work a regular work schedule."
good,Malheureusement pour ceux qui habitent un peu loin l’essence nést pas gratuit et le dédommagement de transport nést pas assez élevé
good,"Muy recomendado, muy buenos trabajadores el trabajo es muy simple."
good,It was pretty good I liked it was able to move around an put my energy to use. Only thing I didn’t like is the workers are not treated fairly. I advise anyone who work there to just stay to yourself and make your money.
good,Working at amazon i had a great experience .all the workers are very good and friendly.I had founf the work very easy.All the people at work was very friendly.
good,"Its indeed a great place to work and job culture is on the higher side. Management is good too but as the organization is growing the opportunities have been decreased. Great platform for beginners to grow the skills and can get experience to survive in a fast paced environment. Overall, I'd recommend Amazon for the people who are beginners and want to grow further in the organization."
good,"It’s a nice place to work. Fast pace, nice working schedule if you like overnight. I enjoyed working there. It was temporary due to it be peak season."
good,"Amazonians are helpfull and they really help you get your goals. Was a bit pressure but was an amazing experience."
good,"You decide your work schedule.  However there are a limited number of hours, and getting enough hours can get really cut throat.  The actual job is fun, and not overly physically demanding.  Good approachable management who are open to suggestions and requests.  I never had any problems in three years working here."
good,Amazon job is self indent most of the time the you work a loan wish is comfortable but sometime it you work with people witch is better because the people are fun.
good,I have worked for amazon twice and love the place. I have worked in customer returns and stow. Both areas were good to work In and easy to adjust in. The staff are friendly and welcoming. Management easy to talk to. It was the agencies that I had the problems with both pmp and addeco would recommend trying to get directly with amazon and skip the agencies
good,Et Amazon they really give u good benefits all almost everything. Plus it's good people there there outgoing they'll help u wit anything if u need it they give u enough breaks for u so u wouldn't be as much tired .
good,"it was an ok-ok job, doesn't fit what i want. but it was like a roller-coaster kind of job and many people left the job because they were not satisfied."
good,"You will get tired of working but you can't finish your work due to cross functional role, there will be too may functions need to be handled by individual, in which it is impossible to maintain constancy. "
good,"you work very hard, and is a cold place, you will find many different people working over there. Some of the manager are not nice and they don't valorise your had work."
good,"This is a fast paced job that has possibilities of growth into a career. "
good,This job was a good learning experience for me. I was able to see what it requires to work in a warehouse. I learned a lot about computers while I was there. Due to long hours I was also taught what it means to work hard.
good,Everyone there is really nice and it's Fun to work there. Don't like the time off policy where you have to have so many hours in order to call or u get fired
good,"basic work, fast paced but extremely easy. paid induction, nice canteen. lots of walking if u are hired as a picker but that is expected Amazon is a massive company so the warehouse is massive!! in rugeley."
good,"Se gana bien , pero tienes q estar dispuesto a estar de pie por largos períodos de tiempo."
good,"I have learned a lot at Amazon. I continue to learn with every opportunity that is presented to me. it is a great place to work if you are just starting out in the job market or if you are retired looking for extra income."
good,"Amazon is an amazing teacher.  It is not always the most cuddly place to work, but you are surrounded by smart and talented folks who use a lot of data and analytics to make complicated decisions."
good,Working at Amazon is really easy. Benefits are nice and the pay is great. Hours vary from 20-25 hours a week to 60 hours on certain occasions. Always room for advancement.
good,"I had a good experience working here, the company is over all a good place to work. I would love to go back in a couple years to work for the company again."
good,I don’t think you are paid enough for the hours you work or the work you do. You have to stand for 12 or 10 hours a day and when it’s time for break you have to wait to the exact time to leave when it take about 5min to get to front of building so your 15min is more like 10min.
good,"Loved Working For Amazon-"
good,Its a nice place to work at I loved it nice people I had a good time made some good money the breaks were always on time I really appreciate it and everything
good,"Good experience while working there. They were new to South Florida and the warehouse was very unorganized and everyday was a new rule, routine etc. The management is helpful but, lack skills. I never ran into any issues."
good,"One thing to note about this job is that its fairly easy and somewhat has drama, which is common. They offer free food at times and never keep there promises."
good,"flex was set my own schedule, it was great as i needed."
good,Good workplace with good pay ..If your with an agency you  won't get hired full time whatever they tell you though. Lond days- three off then four on.
good,If you like hard work and a sore body this is for you. The tasks are not difficult you just stand on your feet for over 10 hours and you are tired to the max after.
good,"The pay and hours are good. There is advancement of you want to work for it. I worked overnight. It was very fastpaced, busy but was definitely fun. Cool Place To Work."
good,"Although I love the benefits at Amazon, there is no room for advancement if you don’t have some kind of degree or Military Background. I’ve tried HR without any luck."
good,"The work was hard but fulfilling and the workplace, at least where I was in NYC was very laid back. However that did not stop them from pushing for excellence. This is one of the only companies that I've worked at that mentioned their leadership principles more than once every day."
good,Buena empresa buena compañía buen horarios buen cafe
good,"Para mi horario nocturno perfecto de 00h a 8:10h. Opción de  hacer horas complementarias, buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"Working here was great! Training was clear, the position was easy to learn, and managers were always available and eager to assist if a problem did arise."
good,"Good working culture,and get to learn."
good,"The workload is unreal. If you're just thinking you want a cush job to do nothing and get paid lots of money- that doesn't exist at Amazon. You'll work hard, and then you'll even harder. The hours are taxing. There are lots of meetings and they are usually 30 minutes long. You could be in meetings for 3 or 4 hours per day while still 'expected' to get your work done which can be another 8 plus hours easily. Burnout is inevitable and the median tenure is only 12 months. "
good,"Fast paced expected, great benefits, easy job requirements with positive support achieve expected goals. Great teammates, and easy process to package customer orders."
good,"They had given us overtime without warning and that was my only problem, Aside From me moving away with no reliable way of getting to the facility. Overall it was decent"
good,"I like working here. The pay is great, however, there are no benefits or employee discounts for neither whole foods or amazon. The one thing i don't like is that its kind of like a companions to get  hours. Shifts are posted online every evening at 6:15pm. if you aren't fast enough at choosing shifts, they are gone by 6:16 pm."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for but a very physical job not much chance for advancement unless who you know plays a role. Interviews are very difficult and a lot of competition.
good,"amazon has a company is very good but management sucks to the core"
good,"Stay focused  my experimce was good in a fast work place , the good thing was we got paid every week. I worked as a packer it was fun but hot. The safety crew was nice and always around."
good,"The employee step/level processes at Amazon should be re-visied; Especially within the IT department. Lower leveled IT associates have more responsibilities than higher leveled associates in other departments often times and require more training, yet are leveled lower and paid less in many respects which make no sense."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for!  It has good benefits for their employees and the best paying wages for Warehouse Positions!  The only thing I didn't like was that the supervisors had their favorites and it showed!  "
good,picking orders to be distributed to customers and consumers through out a 12 hour shift i learned how to pick orders and prepare merchandise management were very helpful
good,I loved the work and money. Wish I could have gotten promoted for working with them for a while. Hard in the beginning but by the first month it's a breeze.
good,"honestly by far the best call center i've worked for, The culture is welcoming and the people are awesome you literally get to work and everyone greets you with a smile, working hours are bit of a drag which is expected for a 24/7 call center but the pay makes it worth it."
good,It’s a great company to work for and they try to look out for people as much as possible. It’s hard to constantly be moving non stop in a company but they try to reward their employees as much as they can
good,"It is some thing to do to get out of the house. It is  very rough on your vehicle however, and the compensation doesn't cover gas and all the damage incurred."
good,A great workplace to work. Training is great and very informative. Trainers are great and great attitudes. Great call volume and customers are great to work with.
good,"My experience  working at Amazon is with satisfaction. This is a part time position, but hours can fluctuate weekly from 27 to 35 hrs. I can choose my hours and days to work. All of the shifts are 5hrs each. Management  is very good and are very helpful. I recommend  this job to any one looking for flexibility and part time work."
good,"Every Center is different, however the facility I worked at was very fun entertaining and pleasant to be a part of. As like any work it's tiring. However I worked at a sortation facility, and I was told to work at a fulfillment facility is much more stressful"
good,"Great place to come and work for if you are interested in growth and development. If you are willing to work long hours, then there is always an opportunity here."
good,Working at amazon is really fun and active the only problem with them is that they have a point system and they don’t care about no excuse even if your child is sick or have an emergency
good,There at Amazon was cool but benefits were kinda disappointing but it was a active place to be apart of i would have loved to stay with the company if they would have just relocated me when i had an incident on the way home from the Fullfilment Center.
good,Busy all day with a great manager. Different people to work with. On your feet for long periods. Job is not hard just learn as you go.  Overall this is a good place to work.
good,It was a good job and I really enjoyed it but it was very difficult to communicate with management in case of emergencies and you were unable to work your shift
good,"Amazon is one of the best companies I've ever worked.  If they offered contract/temporary employment during the day, I'd go back in a heartbeat.  It is definitely a company worth working for."
good,I was hired on Part Time seasonal and spent 6 months with no conversion. never missed work and worked really hard but they would not hire me on. so it was hard knowing if i was going to be let go at any minute
good,"Prepare to work long hours during peak season. But, the pay is worth it. Bi weekly pay. Short breaks. Written up for even smallest error.3 errors and termination."
good,"Very fast paced work place and one of the safes places I've worked. Standing, walking, lifting and pulling most of your day. Management was fun to work with!"
good,Hard work though. Plenty of overtime. Fast paced. Can be stressful. Plenty of breaks. Safety equipment provided. Physically demanding. Friendly work environment.
good,"Good paying jobs, but you must be quick and on your feet 24/7 or you might get T.O.T which can affect your rate. On average, you should pick at 100 percent rate or above, and if you don't, it can affect your numbers. If you work hard and diligently, it should be no problem."
good,"I'm looking for a work place where i can be my self, to be a part of the team and get every job done well."
good,"For the 3 years that I had worked there, their benefits were excellent. I miss the health care the most. And voluntary overtime when available was the best too!"
good,"Mi experiencia en amazon fue buenísima. Me encantaba trabajar allí..  "
good,At Amazon you get to learn a lot of advance yourself in the tech industry. The work is cutting edge and I definitely learnt quite a lot from solid peers who have great knowledge.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my work at Amazon. It was difficult at times, but the longer you are there the more comfortable you become with the culture and the physicality of the job."
good,It was ok the only thing was it was a pretty long drive with the traffic and the manager I had was really ignorant and had no idea what he was doing. He was never really there and was always flirting with the other manager on the 3rd level. He was too grown for that. The work was also ridiculously boring and we couldn’t have our phones (they have metal detectors). But pro tip you can have a smart watch and some Bluetooth headphones and listen to that. They really just don’t want anything that might record/take pictures.
good,Every effort is made to ensure agents are successful at Amazon. The hardest part of the job is when calls are back to back. The most enjoyable part is the friendships that are created
good,"What I really liked about working at Amazon was that everyday you work with different associates. Even though I was hired to work part-time, I enjoyed the atmosphere of working there. Part-time hours were a hit or miss depending on how much work there is for the day. You either work for 3 hours or the full 5 hour shift, but there are plenty of opportunities for you to pick up more hours. Its very fast paced so you're constantly moving around getting a good cardio session in. I guess the only thing that I didn't like was being laid off due to the peak time season ending. Other than that, I would love to work for Amazon again."
good,"nie zawiodłam się na Amazonie a wprost przeciwnie.Praca  wymaga skupienia i zaangażowania- trudno, ale tu się pracuje, a nie uprawia życie towarzyskie.Fizycznie jest ona "" do wytrzymania"" nawet dla osób nie najmłodszych.Faktem jest jednak,że  uciązliwe jest  nagabywanie i wydajność, ale i to jest do wytrenowania.Szkoda jednak,że tu człowiek nie może być pewny,że ma szansę na pracę w dłuższej perspektywie czasowej.Powoli kończy mi się powoli okres 6 miesięcy.A co dalej, nie wiem!!!"
good,If you are young and in great physical shape.  This is for you.  Opportunity for advancement is there. You can relocate to other cities or just to other FC's locally.
good,"I enjoyed picking orders for Amazon. It was a very relaxed atmosphere as long as you stay on task.  Be prepared to walk for 9 hours....great exercise, but tired at the end of the day."
good,"if you come in as agency, do not put your hopes up of becoming permanent. after peak periods, they fire most agency works, so if you work there, just put it at the back of your mind that you are expendable."
good,The team i worked with provided excellent guidance for new hires. Always made sure to have group warm up exercises before going back to work after a break. Checked constantly on team members.
good,Did a temporary job as medical at a warehouse and it was enjoyable. was paid very well and fellow employees seemed happy. was no permanent position which was unpleasant.
good,Best place to be wish they have one in knoxville its a clean place nice ppl cool manager they give u opportunity to grow more in the company the pay is excellent
good,"Employees are constantly pressured to reach the average rate per day. The equipment such as the conveyor belt would often stop working, making it hard to continue processing items and thus make rate."
good,Amazon overall is a great place to work but you can only make it so far in some rolls and then you are stuck . Over all Amazin is a quick paced job that is competitive and over welcoming but good place to start a career.
good,"When you work seasonally be careful if your older, slower on computers or don’t write every rule down they will let you go but they are not concerned with drug dealing, using or promoting on the property."
good,My typical day was getting up every morning and getting to work early clocking in and getting my first break t 10'o clock for my first 15 minute break then going back to scan again then at 12:30 was lunch for 30 minutes then we stretched and went back to work. It is a fun job your mostly alone and it is an quite environment.
good,Just stay focused...work hard.. It doesn't go unnoticed...everyone is nice for the most part..do your part and help your neighbors..everyone is trying to leave on time too
good,My time ran out while I was waiting for a leave of absence to be approved.. it was not approved due to a blackout period which I had no idea would be an issue.. I would still be there if this had not happened because I did enjoy being at Amazon
good,I loved it it was a great learning experience I wouldn't mind going back to work for Amazon fulliment center. They offer great health care and give u lots of chances to advance. It was hard on my feet and knees but it was a very laid back job
good,A typical day consisted of pulling boxes from the converter belt onto pallets. I learned to work at an exceptional speed. The management team works effectively to make sure that one in every team stays on top of everything.
good,I am a contractor so there are a few things that I cannot fairly rate in this position. Overall I love the flexibility that I have as a Flex Contractor and I also enjoy the job itself.
good,"Working for Amazon was amazing, the culture alone makes anyone want to stay there and grow. "
good,"I really liked the 4 days 40 hours a week of work, it was definitely worth it. Yet while working you must move at a fast pace as to make sure you make rate. In the beginning, since you're still new, you're okay. After a few weeks of working there though, they do expect your numbers to improve. If you're moving too slow and you don't make rate a few days somewhat consecutively, then you will be written up. I worked in Stow where we were in charge of scanning items and scanning the shelf or drawer you are going to put them in as to be put up on the website to be bought. It was around winter holidays, so it was busy and packed. Quite often, people would put a stack of small items, that can fit in a drawer, on a shelf. So when you get a big item where it will only fit on a completely or nearly empty shelf and you're having trouble finding one, you can see how it can drop your rate significantly based off the amount of time it takes you to find a spot. But something I really like about Amazon was the diversity of the workers. Young/old, tattoo/piercings, green hair/blue hair. There was no judgement based off appearance and I found that truly beautiful."
good,Hard working is a typical work day. I learned to fight through hard times. The managment was great sometimes. I loved the people I met. Not getting paid enough was very hard to handle. My overall experience here was ok.
good,It was a great place to work. But seems like after some people went to their cars on break and came back inside and smelled like weed. So strong you would get high from the smell.
good,"The bookstore culture is fun with people from all sorts of backgrounds. There are all kinds of cultures and personal experiences to learn from. And a lot of books to read!!"
good,"We would scan and sort up to 75,00 packages in the four hours we are scheduled. There were many different jobs tasks one could switch to daily, from loading to unloading"
good,Not a bad place to work and the bonus program made it even better. the peak season was bearable due to the music and activities. Cons- extremely long days and only a 30 min break for working 10 hr days
good,The best part of working at Amazon is the people. Learned a lot about logistics and priority management. Very competitive environment. Opportunities and learning abound in every direction. Never know what role you will be put into next. Ever changing environment with the stability of remedial tasks throughout.
good,"There is no doubt Amazon is one of the best company to work in your life, all you have to do is you need to land in right team that helps your career growth otherwise you will be stuck and keep on writing multiple page documents."
good,"Good work culture. Can do better. Needs more manager who are willing to listen and available to their executives. One of the fast growing organisations in India, now."
good,"The job was very easy to keep rate, the only downside was being on your feet for 10 hours a day. If you did other or harder jobs inside the facility you were not compensated or didn't receive any recognition from upper management."
good,Good Company to work for. the compensation is decent. the company is very dynamic in nature and is constantly evolving which makes things difficult as there is no data support.
good,"Decent job, with decent people, but the traffic to get there was horrible for the hours I worked. The commute to the airport during high traffic hours caused a lot of aggravation."
good,great experience i loved the hours and flexibility  whivh allowed me to chase  other passions and hold more than one job. it really got me fit because i worked with boxes
good,"started off in pick which was hard because you walk in big circle for 10 hours picking items from a bin from your scanner, its so boring and can be confusing at first. Then I went to stow, which I liked a million times better. In stow you but the items in the bin from a stack of totes which are on u-boats"
good,good place to work if you have decent management.It was fun and fast paced but comfortable. There were many complaints regarding delivery but the chat and assisting shoppers was fun.
good,"A typical day at work I'm doing office work, sending out mail shipments, weekly meetings. The office culture is cool and very enjoyable. Great co workers, lot of energy to feed of of."
good,I liked Amazon when I worked there. The only thing I didn't like about it is standing on my feet all day. I made friendships and learned a lot. Managers actually talked to you with respect and they taught you stuff if you didn't understand.
good,Vision Driven company it's the most innovative company I've ever worked for. Learned teamwork and discipline were major roles in achieving success for department goals.
good,The job was very easy and very fast paced. Four hour shifts with pre set days-off so you always knew your schedule. Paid 15 minute break. PTO hours accrued over time and a point based system for sick days and missed shifts. Extra hours available if wanted. They will lay you off however once demand dies down.
good,I have no complaints.... other then long walks to cafeteria and on your feet the entire night.... if you down time is to high they will let you go....
good,"Work from Home"
good,Only worked a few weeks as a temporary contractor for people ready. They said we finished our project faster than expected so they reassigned everyone to other job sites.
good,"a typical day at working at amazon is very high paced, relaxed and enjoyable. the hardest part I will say is mange your time right, to get it all done"
good,"No complaints really. I loved my job. 40 hours a week and overtime if you want it. No stuffy uniforms, people were friendly.. Managers notice hard work."
good,Amazon can be very fun at times with the games they do play and the family fun days but the job can be really hard work and tiring. Working at Amazon wears on your body and no much time for family and your house hold.
good,Continuous when working work to task is completed the correct way.  Respect my surroundisurrounding team members or person I'm in care of.  Mindful and follow rules that's assigned. Work and don't mind.
good,"Great pay, but work is persistent. 10+ hour days with two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. Have to maintain a certain rate in every department."
good,"good job, good pay just really hard to secure shifts as you have to check hourly to get a shift for the next day and can sometimes over run your block"
good,"The work was easy: taking a box from a conveyor belt, scanning the barcode, and placing it onto the appropriate pallet, but a certain number and letter."
good,"Depending on who your manager was and what area you were in, it was either wonderful or terrible. I was in afe 2 and I absolutely loved it.. Stow and pick were the worst areas to be in."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. You are trained to be able to assist customers and help is always available  Rules are always changing but you are well informed.
good,"I would not recommend this job to those who are not physically able to endure a long day with lots of physical activity involved. Bending, Picking climbing stairs walking long distances to break rooms and bathrooms. an exhaustive hourly rate must always be maintained. Everything is RUSH at this company. The show must go on."
good,"A typical day is get to work,have a group meeting ,go to your station for the day,it's never the same day today,start working ,go to lunch,go back to work,etc. its basically day at work and not a place tyo play or talk,just work."
good,"I loved working at PrimeNow site UAZ1. Working here and being able to connect with others from different places was something that I looked forward too. It did get pretty busy during the holidays, but overall it was a relaxed environment."
good,"It's an excellent experience for career building and advancement."
good,"Even though it is a great place to work, it is a little stressful. The required packages per hour are somewhat hard to achieve. This is where the errors happen. I asked to be moved position but I was not allowed to do so."
good,"The job tries to give you different opportunities within the company, may it be seasonal or permanent. Managment strives to help workers keep up their morale up and assist when they are needed."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you like fast-paced work. It is also very tiring. I was working during peak season so our schedule was very hectic. The pay was great even though I didn't work there for a long time it was a pretty good job
good,"we do start where workers are reminded of work culture, safety, dress code etc,  i love my job because i have experience in more than one area so i get to work in more than one area, i work with associate, i coach associate in different areas , i work wit associate, managers, learning safety and quality"
good,"El trabajo en Amazon es importante porque es una de las grandes empresas a nivel mundial y todo lo que sea aprender, sobre todo en la gestión de la mercancía, es importante para ampliar mi experiencia."
good,My first company in my career. It was an wonderful experience. They provide a peaceful work environment and also very comfort zone especially for women.
good,"Alright, alot of boring work,not quick to advance employees, they have managers that dont understand the life at home as far as parenting. Managers dont realky work with team members which is why alot of people quit."
good,Life hit me in the face and I had to quit but if I could go back I would most definitely. This place is amazing. Work hard and have fun. That's it. Outbound is definitely the place to go. I wish I hadn't had to leave.
good,Amazon is a good place to work and gain plenty of experience due to the fast pace environment.  A typical day at Amazon is not certain because of the fast pace unplanned events do happen that required an immediate attention.  Management is very good at focusing on customer obsession and sometimes forget the employees
good,I work 12 hour shifts beginning at 6:30 PM until 7:00 AM standing on a concrete floor packaging single items for shipment.  
good,"Greeat as a job on the side, not suitable for full time employment. you go in 15 minutes before your chosen shift, scan and load in all designated parcels. once finished delivering, you are finished. can run over designated hours but mostly finished early"
good,"Fun Place to work but management is all ways changing, it's hard to get to know your managers. You will have rate that you must hit, some days it is hard to make rate because there is not enough work, but most days it is easy."
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for overall. Being a warehouse associate can be a difficult grind, but if you can manage to advance beyond that and make it into one of the advanced hourly or salary roles, it's not too bad. You'll have a better chance of promotions and advancing quickly if you are flexible with moving around the country."
good,great money constant work time goses by so fast.also a great work while on the job. every week pay was nice and got to meet new people. managment was horrible my superviser was very rude.
good,I only left Amazon to Advance in job placement. The jump from Assistant to Manager is very difficult without a degree. You can move to lead fairly quickly by working hard.
good,I really enjoyed working there.. I wish i could return with a permanent position. They took very good care of the employees and they made sure that we could pick up more hours of desired
good,Work at Amazon is physically demanding. Very fast paced. Hard to transfer or get more pay. The people there are amazing. They do their best to accommodate  you so you can remain employed
good,The key part of a typical day is starting with organization.  The two key aspects of a typical day are planning the meeting calendars and then the specific tasks you want to have completed.
good,I loved the fast-paced work environment that allowed you to attain and maintain a fit body. Teamwork is essential at Amazon and I enjoyed building a repertoire with supervisors and my co-workers.
good,"More training needs to be given to new employee's "
good,A great job for anyone looking for part time work. There are a variety of shifts and times for working. It is a fun and high energy work environment. Times goes by fast.
good,"I wouldn't recommend Amazon to anyone with kids because we all know anything an happen when we have kids. But if you don't have any kids, I feel it's the best place to work. I would like to go back."
good,A typical day at work included walking down to the assembly line area. Doing some basic stretches and discuss work strategy. After that start work with a cheer
good,Great place to work but they hav a big turnover rate because people dont me there quota its fac pace and alot of walking if u trying to be thin this is tje place to be cuz it is a work out
good,typical day was on the line mooving packages stretching before as a team and management wasnt really all that helpful and it was fun to never work with the same person
good,"the work was difficult, it challenges both your physical and mental endurance, but at the end of it, there are great rewards, including great pay and great advancement opportunity as Amazon is a company that prefers to promote within."
good,"Fast-paced, good benefits, fun environment"
good,It's a great seasonal position. Amazon teaches you everything you need to know. Gave me time off when I needed to move across country for the military.
good,Shipping & Receiving. Responsible for scanning and preparing packages for shipment via PTI trucks. Loading pallets to truck unloading incoming shipments. Personally this a job you have to be fast pace
good,"good pay and hours. very flexible but mostly kids working there. there are a lot of issues with some of the younger people working there."
good,It was a good working job you learn a lot was the best experience the work environment is good also good people what I learn is that you have to be fast careful an aware of your surroundings
good,"This company only offers part time, but an excellent place to work.  I would highly recommend this as a starter job.  You get to meet all types of culture."
good,"Amazon is a good job , it keeps you on your feet . You’ll learn a lot , it’s a great environment, you’ll learn lots of stuff working at amazon . Amazon is good"
good,It was a great job. Enjoyed the environment and fast pace. Was moving up the ladder at a very quick rate. It started off part time but once i spoke with my supervisor. They allowed me to work even on schedule off days.
good,"I have an great expirence through 6 months I have worked in Amazon ,a very good company . The management staff is very good  . I Learned more about  my work on which field I am that is data entry."
good,"started with shift meeting and goal setting.perfomed stretching exercises and started my assigned tasks;picking,packing,stocking supplies,or loading shipments onto trucks."
good,"They are always about customer satisfaction and care, making sure things were as close to perfect as it can get. Loud, but fun with a high social rate, if the building had music. It was really fun learning and moving up inside the warehouse is pretty easy."
good,"Learned a lot about warehouse work, very different from 8-5 office job.  Less pay but not stressful and no micro-management. Get plenty of exercise. Cool managers too. The hardest part of job is dealing with rude flex drivers."
good,Solidarité entre les travailleurs esprit de vivre ensemble
good,"Solid management, goals articulated, expectations up front. Environment is one where change is welcome so methods are not set in stone and that may frustrate some employees used to a more traditional work space. Data drives everything-it's not about how often you work sick, or are on time-did you make rate?"
good,Here in amazon i learned to be hardworking and it was a good place to learn responsibilities and to be a good person. Here i become passionate towards my work and feel comfortable to do long shifts of work.
good,"at amazon LGb4  it was tiring and stressful while at in Irvine, it was very light and less 10hrs.. the shifts in Irvine is about 4-5 hours and you can still rest ... in LGB4, you'll have to stand for 10hrs and gain a lot of pain. the workplace has a lot of cultures from different cities around the world. management. its ok but some of them are very bossy... the things that I learned are working harder, make people happy and have fun and I will be making history."
good,It was ok I like that it was a fast past type of job. It also taught me how to be patience wit people and how to work in a factory . I had a good time workin there jus wish it was full time .
good,I believe that Amazon is the right place to work and to earn more money. I have got many experience from the company. I always let to know for every body to join Amazone and to work. I
good,"Great benefits but can become very stressful. There are many departments to learn throughout the building along with advancement into different areas such as IT, facilities, management."
good,The environment here is really fun. I had a chance to make some things from scratch using only open source software with certain licenses. The only reason I left is that they didn't have any work lined up for me after a year and I had to go somewhere else.
good,the hardest part of job or the most enjoyable part of the job or workplace culture management or what you learned or a typical day at work I'm Shankar senva
good,"Best platform to gain knowledge for fresher. It was my first job of life...I have learn lots of new things about professional life style, coordination, organization, decipline .Most importantly the coordination Nd corporation between senior to lower level employee was very nice in Amazon ."
good,Pays well. Fast work pace and decent hours. Will give you stock options after so long and annual raises. After working for a while or after peak season though they will lay you off.
good,the management team was awful. new rule every day. if i wasnt contracted out through a 3rd company it wouldve probably been better working straight through amazon
good,Mozliqe lecz luderzy  czuja sie tam bogami i znajomy xnajomemu tak tam dziala
good,"be very careful of their strict no tolerance policies, i used to work there and was let go for a minor error in judgement but since i came across a no tolerance policy i was terminated and am now never able to apply again."
good,"Very busy warehouse work, you will never see your manager or supervisor, Lots of people, there is a quota, you have to do whatever they tell you to do."
good,"My overall review will be that is an excellent job/carrier where you can learn new things, have the opportunity to meet lots of new people. You have many options to advance in your area of expertise, also have the ability to add new skill to your resume."
good,"It was a good place to work, I loved the environment, the management team, and overall the employees. A typical day at work would just consisted of stowing items into shelves. I learned how to restock merchandise, how to read codes and work different scanners. Management team was always available at any shift i worked. They were always helpful and always giving tips for an easier day at work."
good,"i was a temp during peak season of 2016, i thought it was one of the best places i have ever worked at. just be prepaired to not be able to have much of a personal life. i have 2 kids and it made it hard to be able to make appointments or other things. 60 hour work weeks during peak make you feel like a zombie at times but its worth it for the huge paycheck at the end"
good,"This position is good as a secondary job for supplemental income. The pay is good and the hours are flexible, the downside is the lack of hours available."
good,Like any job there is up and down periods where hours are high then low. The job itself is very cool. The thing I didn't like the most is the leadership does not practice responding to emails which is pretty much the only real way to communicate if you're not physically at the location.
good,"I enjoyed everyday at Amazon.  It is great being part of the best company in the world.  Everyday is something different.  If you are looking for a career, Amazon is the place to be."
good,"I loved the money, and the benefits, the job was labor intensive. there's not much room to move up, but they tend to hire within.. flexible schedule and pto as well as upt and vacation time from day 1"
good,There should be more help and support implemented for associates who have kids. 10 hour work days don't quite work when you're a single mom. also taking your personal time that you have to accumulate throughout the year to be with your child isn't quite fair either. My daughter was born 7 weeks early with a heart condition and there is no maternity benefits in place to help mother with premature babies. I actually missed out on 10 weeks of my maternity leave because she came early. Other than that amazon has been very good to me and is an amazing place to work with amazing benefits. Very progressive.
good,"no real complaints, just didnt get the chance to advance in the workplace, easy scan box to box, no struggle with co workers, relaxed environment , short hours"
good,"typical day at amazon go in early am  to help to sort boxes and jiffies from low and high side. before co workers start to come in. "
good,"Typical day at work, is scanning boxes and put them in a pallet, you can be splitting the boxes by letters, and you can work at your pace."
good,"This was the first place and time I had ever experienced prejudice towards me.  "
good,"Amazon has some great things about it and I would recommend a friend to work for them. Even tho I was fired from them I have nothing against them. They pay well, they have great opportunities, and you can get somewhere in life if you are willing to put in the time and effort. It is how every not for everyone. If you have certain political views it's best to keep them to yourself. I have nothing against them and I think they have a lot of good to them."
good,Good place to work only bad thing is seasonal workers are let go after the holidays even if they are better than those who are permanent. Other than that its good hours with abikity to get more if you want and I would work there again.
good,"Great job to supplement your income from another job. The sort center is a great higher paid warehouse position. perfect for college students! Management is typical, you just take orders from them, sometimes they can be cool, sometimes they can be disrespectful and rude. Very few opportunities to advance. Straightforward work that doesn't vary much from each day. Paid each week, but the most hours allowed are 30 or less! Not really a place to work forever, but the pay is better compared to other warehouse jobs with duties and requirements."
good,"En medio del trabajo unas horas de diversión muy  buen detalle.  Muy responsables con el pago, valorar y premiar a los buenos, buenos beneficios, buen horario,"
good,"Strongly encouraged to let your body get use to the work that your doing. The job is very fast paced , you  are timed but if you keep up and you'll be fine."
good,This is a great job for anyone who needs health benefits and stability. The company provides great incentives and you end up being rewarded by more than just a paycheck.
good,I love working at Amazon I work night shift I thought I'll never work night shift my first night shift ever I clean bathroom in break room in it was an a lot of folks in this big place security was awesome I even help out with other stuff the people was cool I prefer in you stick to yourself thou but other then that it was a good job
good,Weekly pay and you stay busy a lot of team players they also have good hours to work. Supervisors are great trainers and it's a clean environment for workers.
good,Pessoas que não tinha capacidade de liderança.               As ações de corrente em momentos que deixava a desejar.
good,Great opportunity for promotion the hours are long and the team work ethic isn't strong. Employees come and go not may stay in the company because of the cut throat environment.
good,Job is job where i job with a great time working here and its fun and stuff and I like the people who work there but HR is a SOAB who wants to eat your soul
good,"good place to work, "
good,It was not a bad job. The only issue I dealt with was with associates. The culture in my specific warehouse was not good. Managers just cared about there numbers and getting promoted and didn't care about associates. Also didn't know much about the warehouse. Used us process assistants as slaves at times.
good,Overall good company to work for. Felt thepay was very competitive and the benefits were about right all things considered. For the most part enjoyed my experience.
good,"Enjoy  working environment, fun place to work and build a career."
good,Each day we would start with a review of what needs to be done in order to the process of sorting merchandise we excerise prior to getting on the floor to begin our day the culture was truly a mix of people the hardest part of the job was to make sure the pallets were correctly stacked and wrapped. The enjoyment of the job was being rewarded or reconigized for a job well done to meet the goal of getting packages out for delivery.
good,"A typical day for me is 10-12 hours long. I've learned how to unload, sort, scan, wrap and stage packages. Management never stays in one spot to answer questions you might have. The hardest part of the job is having the stamina to be on your feet for at least 10-12 a day. The most enjoyable part of my job is unloading our trucks and sorting the packages for the lines in our building."
good,I have only work at amazon for a short time but the work team is very welcoming to new people. They are a nice place to look into to make a little extra money.
good,"The money is definitely there for whomever wants to work for it. Wouldn't Advise anyone who still would seek a personal life. This job has 12hr shifts no windows, no talking, no music, no phone usage allowed, two 10min breaks and a lunch."
good,"Very busy days, starting with production meetings, moving on to daily research of building losses. Afterwards being able to set up SQL jobs to better research.  In the afternoon was able to sit down with managers on their business needs and how I could do to help."
good,"Good management and supportive staf."
good,worked a 10 hour shift for 4 days straight. you do have to be on your feet the whole 10 hours. they always have overtime available and voluntary time off.
good,"I love that you can excel at the job and within our department. The compensation benefit packages are so great. The clock in system are simple, but the hardest part of my job was the physical pains and exhaustion from always moving on your feet for 10 hours. With no time to stop. The most thing I enjoyed was the days off were 3-5 days depending if you were part time. They worked with your schedule. I love the HR department for that. I will work here again, no questions asked!"
good,Great and friendly workplace where co workers get along well. Good work days. Friendly environment. Team work if need be. Good supervisor. Good environment.
good,10 hours shifts walking up and down a warehouse to deliver peoples products. I personally like it cause it gave me time to myself and the people around were amazing.
good,amazon et une entreprise qui demande boucoup d effort a leur emploié et il a pas bcp de temp de pause
good,"In my time at Amazon, I worked for the German customer service division."
good,The place is good but too much standings. Also can get very stressful andthe hours are long but the payments is good. Too much control for people coming checking on you when you make mistake.
good,"I enjoyed working there, made new friends and learn new thing. The work place was good when I started, the people work hard, but is hard to say the same about management."
good,"My time at Amazon.com allowed me to interact with people from all over the world, which gave me a whole new perspective on how people are largely the same no matter where you go."
good,"Good benefits, no job security. Decent work life balance. How much more of a review could you possibly need and how does this help me GTE a different job?"
good,Love the staff and employees. I didn't like the long 10-12 hr shifts. It was REALLY HOT in the aisles.  Great Pay and benefits!!! I would do it again.
good,great place to work  just apply early for a permanent position do ur job do not  make conversation   that isn't necessary with co-workers and you will be fine  better yet keep your head down and work
good,My typical day would consist of loading trucks with boxes and scanning them in. There are multiple things to do and you can kinda just go around doing what you want until you find something that you like. Sometimes someone will come up and tell you to go somewhere else though. The job is super chill and easy. Some people are just awful but no more than you'll find at other places.
good,"I personally loved working at Amazon as a CSA. My Manager was amazing and super understanding, and all of my coworkers were great. I did really well in the actual work of the job, it's easy as long as you don't get choked up on the phone. The hours were odd so I never actually got to leave my house and see people, and the customers were rude. They tend to get very cranky after the menu, also a lot are technilogically impaired. I had to quit only to take care of family and my hours didn't allow that."
good,very busy and fast pasted...alotn of walking up to 15 miles a day...great environment to work in....different cultures
good,"Best Place to be in.!"
good,the worst part was having to stand for 10 hours and only turn your hips at most. it can be a secure job if you can maintain your rate. co-workers were great. they pay you well but expect you to work hard.
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon due to its fast pace working and great pay they offer weekly. They facility is state of the art and the breakrooms are quite splendid with many food workers can buy.
good,"very hard for management to be prominent with amount of workers very hard work with very little appreciation from higher ups "
good,Amazon was a great place. times may get tiring from working 12 hour shifts every day with no days off. overall the Job was great. The managers had great energy
good,"A typical day at amazon begins  mins before your scheduled shift, you will be assigned to a post and carry out the duties of that post until the end of the shift, the dismissal time is scheduled for four hours after your clock in time but can extend up to an hour later depending on volume or production. Management is fairly good although sometimes they do not seem to be in sync with one another.  My coworkers are the most friendly and helpful people i know, i love them,  The hardest part of the job is sometimes keeping up with the demands of management and the high pace environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the job itself.  Amazon is a fun and easy place to work."
good,"had to leave cause of distance, but overall good working experience,"
good,Nice Amazon its worldest large company ande this will giving as per everyday new to learn i mean here is every day is as an day firstnt to grow up more
good,The hardest part was standing on my feet. I loved my job and my other coworkers. I learned how to work in an assembly line and how to push myself to work harder.
good,"Work is awful long days and hours will be on your feet all day but company is good to work for better then most others. The pay is fairly high starting out, great benefits"
good,A typical day would be come in and work either on the inbound dock or receive lines. On the dock I would check in the vendor products off the truck then send them to the receivers. On the receive line I would scan the products into the inventory and place in a cage to go to the shower so they can put the products on the shelves.
good,"Excellent place to start up and learn new things."
good,"Good place to work in and excell in. Opportunities for growth and development. A good job to have while your in college, working on yourself."
good,"Work environment is generally open and accepting, diverse, with many opportunities to be developed into a leader in the company."
good,It was overall good learning experience.You are surrounded by people who want to bring change and make people life simpler.
good,"I enjoyed working there meet a lot of nice people and there you can grow they offer a lot for the employees. "
good,"good company only worked seasonal , it was a fast paced work place long hours but was worth the experience."
good,Fast paced environment in which production was required. Everyday there was a new challenge and I learned more each trying day. I got better day by day
good,A great environment to work in. I worked for the temporary staffing agency. I am looking to go back as a blue badge.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of checking I had the correct scanner, keeping my designated isle clean at all times and storing packages to their designated location. In this company I learned the importance of responsibility. For example if i did not complete my task then my team would fall behind as well mine. I learned to help my co-workers in time of need whether it be questions or help in their position. The hardest part of this job would be not having security that I will have a job."
good,"I had a manager that hired me that was dynamic and intelligent but the person I report to is very demanding so it only takes one person to ruin it for such a great company.  I worked so hard, and I was a producer but this person us jealous of my success so it is time to move on.  It is a shame because I really like everyone there but she is holding me back from moving into other teams."
good,"Great place to get your foot in the door in the warehouse field. Depending on what department you're in, expect a workout. In my opinion, there is nothing really hard about the job."
good,Hard hot work during the summer. Busy long hours during peak. o-workers are awesome. Some management is ok. Learning Team rocks! Training is thorough and on going for everyone.
good,"Amazon m'a permis de connaitre un monde de travail que je ne connaissais pas du tout, celui de l'usine, ou encore du travail en 2x7. L'équipe était agréable, il y a beaucoup d'entraide. J'ai pu développer la rapidité et l'efficacité, tout en respectant le code SMART ainsi que la qualité des colis et les consignes. Beaucoup de communication avec le manager, ou les chefs d'équipe."
good,"i loved work enviroment, "
good,"Hello,"
good,I spent 6 years at Amazon and I loved it. Great management and visibility to Jeff. You would end up learning a lot about ecommerce business. You work hard and make history - not a place where you would go for work life balance. But a place where you go to build your resume.
good,"I would give this facility a 10/10 because everyone in the different departments know how to keep things moving and with limited downtime. The skills i learned here are wonderful skills to have and with the help of other team members made the work a lot less stressful. "
good,"It was hard work , however I learned the value of hard work and a dollar. Learned how to  believe in my own abilities to succeed in a fast pace environment."
good,THIS Is A Job That Keeps You Busy. co workers are awesome. hardest part beating a good scan rate to win prizes. most enjoyable part about this job is that you get to express yourself
good,"Betriebs und Arbeitsklima voll suber"
good,The company overall is a great company. Just an FYI before one applies there; There is no job security. Prepared to worry for your job everyday you work there.
good,Its an ok place to work but I have gone as high as I can in the company without a bachlore degree and they are in a wage freeze.
good,"Although the actual work is pretty boring because of its repetitiveness, you have fun meeting new people and spending time with your co-workers. Employees are shown appreciation."
good,"As a Sr. Seller Support Associate of Seller Support team (TAM), worked in multiple disciplines helping the sellers on Amazon.com with the issue regarding their inventory, website issues along with the payment settlements as per the company’s policies."
good,"the job title, ""picker"" is a very easy, straight forward job. You walk around pushing a cart with a tot on it. You also read a scanner you carry with you through out the mods. When your tot is full you put it on the convector belt and grab a new tot and start over. you walk miles throughout the day."
good,I worked for the Coffeyville Ks location. ( Now Closed ). The work is easy and the hours are ok depending on what shift you get on. If you are lucky enough to be selected to become a full time Amazon employee the job is awesome. However to get to that point you have to endure Staff Managments bull
good,"Easy work tasks"
good,"A empresa tem destaque no ramo de logística de transportes, além disso, seu nome é bem conceituado na cidade de Manaus, tanto em relação a eficiência dos serviços, quanto bom relacionamento com seu quadro de funcionários."
good,Start your night shift with a team brief set up your scanner and away to go .i leaned a lot as I went to various areas throughout the FC to work I found the management very helpful.I also made a few friends while  I was working there .I loved my time at Amazon at the christmas period the hardest part I found was going to various picking areas like from  B to FG. I loved my time working at Amazon in Swansea until the day I got my contract terminated .Also the following week when I was charged with the the sum of £28.84 for my uniform boots I gave back to the Abacus manager which is still in denial
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, they had respectful management, and I learned many new things, the hardest part was working on the dock, The most enjoyable part of the job was probably  all the opportunities they offered, A typical day is depending where you're at in the company I worked in Packing at the beginning of the day we would get our scanners and then have a meeting and get ready for the day."
good,"Every employee on time,sefty protection first ,the quality tipe ."
good,"working with amazon makes you focused and motivated  to achieve your target for the day because its a customer focused company the needs and demands of all customers are paramount at all times. its always very busy because we attend to thousands of customers daily, team work is very important. the hardest part of the job is you are on your feet through out your shift and the most enjoyable is you get to work with team mates you can call friends at the end of the day because we assist each other."
good,there was always a job to do with the fork lifts and always very fast pace job
good,"the hardest part of my work is walking 9 hour on shift"
good,Zappos was the funnest place I've ever worked. Looked forward to going in.
good,good days off but hard to get a permanent position. security at door everymorning
good,"By far one of my best places to have worked. The supervisors are great communicators and helpful. Very professional too. Although it was a very hot, fast paced environment, the atmosphere was stress free. I learned computer skills, shipping skills and the importance of stretching before work. The hardest part of the job was the conveyor belts in the multi packing as if you are the only one rampacking and three or four are packing, it can get pretty backed up but the supervisors were always ""on the job"" to see you got help. The most enjoyable part was the stress free atmosphere as everyone I worked with seemed to be happy at their jobs."
good,a typical day at work was standing in a little cubical type spot and putting 1 item in a box tapiong it up and sending it on to shipping
good,Start the day with stretching and managers telling us what has to be done by the end of the day. in the 2 years i have worked there i have learned inbound and outbound. Last years Christmas time i was the primary problem solver. There is a couple good managers and a couple that do the minimum. I enjoy the people i work with as people not as workers. The hardest part of the job is Christmas time because amazon just hires anyone and we have to deal with people that smell and have no common sense. I enjoy outbound processes.
good,"Typical day included working on various trouble tickets, working on projects, and tending to the customers. It was a good balancing act which reflected how good ones time management was. Co-workers handled their jobs and assisted as needed. Management always had an open door policy which I respected."
good,Typical day is me picking items alongside with co-workers. I learned how to train people in the job I do.
good,"Typical day starts with announcements and warm ups and stretches . You learn to use your body the proper way and not to over extend certain muscles and yourself . Management was always willing to help as much as they could in any situation . Co-workers were all fun and energetic and from all parts of the country and world . The hardest part about the job were the long shifts , they were 10hrs long. The most enjoyable part about the job was the free workout !"
good,A productive working environment that took out extensive long periods in your day.
good,"I have worked at Amazon.com for almost a year as a subcontractor for a company called Avisys Inc. With Avisys I handled the every day audio visual needs of Amazon including setting up conference rooms in specific table/chair settings, connecting conference calls/phone calls for customers, managing calendars through Microsoft outlook, and just general customer service. I thoroughly enjoy helping the Amazon employee's run their meetings as smoothly as possibly with a positive attitude on my mind at all times."
good,working for the company was ok. Tems work 10 hour shifts 4 days or nights a week. When it get closer to Xmas we work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week.
good,Being an author is a very fulfilling job. I am able to write and publish on my own time.
good,they provided great opportunities to try many projects so that I could improve a lot.
good,"Arriving for a 6.30 am start, picking goods using a scanner, then putting goods into a plastic box, scanning the box and sending the box to the packing department."
good,I would perform every function in running the business as I was the owner and only employee. I would acquire/purchase items for resale then list/sell the items online. I would also perform accounting functions as well as shipping/packaging the items. Every duty entailed in running an online business I performed myself.
good,"As a picker at Amazon I had a quota that needed to be met every night. Within this position I had to walk up to twenty miles a night, lifting over fifteen pounds."
good,"Good place to work, lots of hours and great stock options. Fast paced work, seasonal overtime."
good,Amazon company gives a better experience.it helps to get a better opportunity in jobs for youth.shows entrepreneur skill .Better salary make employers more comfort
good,great company if u can't handle shifts and working on a public holiday I suggest this may not be for you. if you can't handle reaching target then you need to look into something else.
good,The work is easy. It's a great job as long as you have reliable transportation and babysitter. The atmosphere is friendly and most are willing to help and teach what's the best way to deal with job. Management is ok but some but it's like with any job you take the good and bad and pray the good outways the bad
good,"Amazon est une bonne entreprise, le travail là-bas est certes dur, mais le salaire étant correct fais ressentir un sentiment de mérite."
good,Amazon is pretty laid back and fun to work for it was still challenging In picking and also shipping for cross training the peak season was kind of rough but it was a good work experience
good,"très bonne expérience chez Amazon  "
good,Amazon call centers are a great place to get your foot in the door with Amazon.  Trying new departments with different job duties will allow you to fine tune your job experience with Amazon.
good,"There are so many moving parts and there is constant change. You are expected to learn to do something but only to receive communications that the method has changed/updated. This is a constant, you need to be flexible."
good,"Si Lavora in maniera velocissima, non si può fermare ed è un lavoro manuale."
good,"l'environnement de travail et la sécurité sont très bons mais les cdi sont très difficiles , J'ai travaillé pendant 8 mois les leads m'ont proposé un CDI mais au final il n'y a pas eu d'opportunités"
good,Amazon is a very good place to work. There are pros and cons they have attendance standards and you have to get a sort of reach a target everyday before the end of your shift
good,"Easy to get on, some positions are pick your own hours! Easy to learn, great management, and good training. This is a great company to work for, highly recommended!"
good,Great place to work and earn a living to pay the bills. Even though I no longer am  able to work there it was a beautiful experience that was good for my skills
good,You must go and see by yourself then you will know! All I can say is you will be wowowwowow! I was like that but only after 2 months I was omg really is happening!
good,"Travailler chez Amazon m'a permis de voir que le travail en usine peut être intéressant malgré les horaires en décalées, et le fait que chaque jour il faut être productif. Même si je ne souhaite plus travailler chez eux, je recommande à tout le monde de vivre l'expérience que j'ai vécu chez Amazon."
good,"Can earn good money but hard work if no previous experiences in the job. That's what I found anyway. Friendly colleagues, decent management. Get your own van"
good,amazon is a great company.  coworkers are very friendly and respectfull. but there are a lake of work sometimes. safety is highly consider which i appreciate more at Amazon Company
good,I love my job at Amazon. It was something different. It's good money to. They work with you as much as they can if they can help you. They are a really good place to work for.
good,"Se si ha voglia di lavorare non si hanno problemi,ambiente sano,sicuro,massimo rispetto tra tutti e per tutti.I ritmi sono realmente molto sostenuti,ci vuole impegno e buona volontà.Personalmente tornavo dal lavoro distrutta ma orgogliosa del mio lavoro.Stipendio super puntuale.Ci tornerei di corsa."
good,"Amazon is  great company to work for there are a few pros & cons to it "
good,Una buona esperienza lavorativa che aiuta a temprare la persona.
good,This job elevated my customer service skills from sales floor to the IT world. I learned skills that are transferable to many work environments and how to tailor them into my personality.
good,"Hours can be long, if your the type of person who likes to be home dead on 4pm every night then it's probably not for you but if your organised and a competent driver then 6pm is acheivable most days. All in all there are better jobs but there's also a lot worse ones."
good,its a fun job easy going people will help when needed some days where hard the pay is good most days are fun i will work there again  the discounts are great
good,A typical day at work would start with clocking in and attending a morning meeting. After the meeting we would be assigned our routes. Upon receiving our routes we would locate our routes then begin the loading process. After loading we would inspect our vehicles and make sure we have all of the necessary tools fulfill our daily route. I learned how to drive safely for a long period of time and got better with G.P.S. Management did a good job of keeping us aware of safety issues etc. The workplace culture was fun. The hardest part was trying to find time for breaks during some routes. The most enjoyable part was that everyday was different.
good,I enjoy Amazon everybody helps everybody.  It's a fast paced company. But they make sure the customers are happy. By delivering there products on time.
good,Lavoro facile supportato da school pratiche per ogni attività interna.
good,"Working at Amazon is an experience unforgettable. Its love at first sight, the building, environment, the culture, people, management. You always feel like you are part of something big, worthwhile and that you matter. Its just awesome and wonderful. I can't wait to go back there!!!"
good,Fun workplace. People  were great. Great work hours. Great people. Fun people. Good incentive  programs. Diverse workplace. Far commute. Managers are good people.
good,mi sono davvero entusiasmato al lavoro svolto presso amazon
good,"Hire only temporary but chances to get hired within if you start working directly with Amazon. Fast pace, independent contractor scenario. Try to pass the permanent employment auditions. You work hard, you’ll get recognized."
good,I enjoyed working here. the work was a lot but the pay in the end was worth it could work on the how the management team worked tho and allow more bathroom time.
good,"I loved working at Amazon. Due to constant training, not only the technical training, but the true dedication to Customer Service and continuously striving to be develop and implement the best services."
good,"Amazon was a good place to work for. They had all training paid, good salary for what you do. But you have to pre book shifts all the time so no guarantee that you can work regularly."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon because it was casual work and management was really nice,  some of the workers were not so nice. It was a fast paced job but easy work"
good,"Various Cultures.  No doubt. "
good,Amazon is a great place to work. You get paid worth for your job. Work life balance is a bit messy. But considering for overall job it is great place.
good,"Equal opportunity Employer , very great working environment . For some one that wants to improve in the distribution end of warehousing of goods for sale ....the OJT on the job training is very good . The ambience and benefits are encouraging and the best of this job is the offer to employees to have a career choice."
good,Love working great face pace always busy friendly ppl just bad management that doesn’t no how to run a warehouse a lot of military and straight out of college managers that have no clue what to do.
good,"You will get tons of work to do in 10 hours job,"
good,"Good job for a person in shape . Amazon is a active job , you have to continuously move around your whole shift out side of the 15 minute break you get."
good,"Wonderful experience,  great location easy commute. Bigger location would be wonderful for this station.  More parking. And AC would be great. Team works very hard"
good,"awesome work place. relaxing work days. Good schedule with flexible hours. 10 hour shifts are ok to work with, but it kind of burns you out. Thank goodness for those UPT hours!"
good,"A typical day at work at Amazon is very fast paced, physically challenging, and sometimes draining experience.  The hardest part of the job is the high work demands/quotas to meet such as stow rates and adapting to sometimes daily changes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the people that I have met over the past few months."
good,"Great culture, if you have any creative ideas management listens. No micro management which is great. Fun working environment such playing ping pong and enjoying adult beverages."
good,"Shifts were posted online for later in the current week, and were first come first serve, making it hard to get hours. If shifts were posted for the next week, that would at least give people more of an opportunity to adjust their schedules for work."
good,Good job. Enjoyed the peak season woth the added overtime. I liked that i had sick leave and vacation time. Aweosme place to qork if tou are motivated.
good,I love the environment and the people the work isn’t too demanding  although the hours could be a little bit better. Management is always very helpful and respectful.
good,"Nice place to work with good pay, hours and solid management. They offer persk for employees off and on the clock and are a great company to work for all around."
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon.  While working there I was able to refine my skills such as organization and multi-tasking in a fast paced work environment.
good,The job was 10 hours a day 4 days a week except when we needed overtime then it was 5 days a week you are expected to get a certain amount of work done which means you had to work fast. You have to be efficient at what you did when you did your job you had to do it right but it was a good place to work be prepared for a lot of walking
good,"Mi sono trovato bene a lavorare per Amazon. Se avessi avuto un contratto a lungo termine, l'avrei accolto con uno stimolo maggiore."
good,It's a great career job to be on move up in your position learn a lot at Amazon so many different positions and they help pay for school and they care for your child.
good,Job was a great experience just needs to work on their system of when sick time is being used because i was terminated due to points when i actually used sick time
good,"Working for Amazon is not easy. There are long hours and plenty of overtime. There are departments in Amazon where I feel is easier to work at than others. The dock is the hardest department to work at, while being a forklift driver is less demanding. This not say that being a forklift driver is easy. There are rates that you have to met or exceed ever hour on your shift. There are days where you can easily meet the goal, while there's other days you can't because there are things that can be out of your control. If you get a chance to work for Amazon, I say give it a try. The pay is descent and the benefits are better than most places around where I live."
good,The hardest part of the job is the standing up part but I did lerarn how to do a lot of things at amazon. It is never a dull moment I love learning new things and I was always being taught something new.
good,Great work situation.  Great manager.  Excellent level of training given.  Felt very prepared to start work.  Would recommend Amazon to anyone.  It is a full time job with great benefits.
good,"It is a good job and has the potential for any overtime you can ask for, the pay isn't the best and you work more then you are ""worth"". However, it is a job and it does a good job at paying the bills."
good,Amazon customer service has a great work environment with amazing people & opportunities. It is very easy to move up in the company once you’ve found what role you would like to take on.
good,Easy warehouse job. If you do not mind the work then this is the job that you need to look at. The pay is great the work itself is easy and they are very accommodating.
good,productive workplace. Fast pace well-developed company with good management. co-workers friendly. good pay and great health benefits. Higly motivated company to work for. Sorters are energic and independent workers motivated to work in a fast pace warehouse  fulfillment center for 12 hour shift.
good,"Training very good. Enjoyable. Brings on people who are struggling with electronic systems. Only a pity we were told quite late we have to take holidays or lose them by 30th Sep."
good,The best place to work and prove yourself .great work culture . Depending on each department the shift timings depend .targets are too hard to achieve
good,Hard work but pays well. Overcrowded. Hard to make rate. Not enough breaks. Constantly pressured to increase productivity. Leadership does not seem to care
good,Really liked working here. Other workers was nice and will talk to you no matter who you are. Really doesn't matter what culture you represent they will respect you. Even though you don't understand English there are workers there that will help you out.
good,"Had the opportunity to be a Brand Ambassador on a college campus. Responsibilities included putting on events, running a social media page, and having a complete understanding of their products."
good,It’a a really nice place to work at. Only thing is that they only give us part time shifts and I commute 32 miles always. Therefore I am looking for another part time to be able to cover all of my bills.
good,Amazon has always been great to me. And I have always been a great employee for them and gave my loyalty due to the company being fair to its employees. Love being a picker for them.
good,Excellent work environmemt. There's always something new and different to learn. Upskilling is done regularly to keep you updated of changes made in process and procedure.
good,I would have stayed with Amazon were I not needed at home with my special needs son. Control your own time off as long as you had the time to play with.
good,Taking care of the customer was the first form of action everyday. I also felt that taking care of the work crew was very important. Giving them the guidance to be successful so the customers stayed happy.
good,You will work hard and long but I have lifetime friends and associates and the pay is great. The managers can be aholes sometimes but just depends on who your manager is I've had the worst and the best and some in between. U really don't interact with your manager unless you're in a smaller warehouse. Everything is by computer for the most part. If you're an honest hard worker this is a 4.5/5 star company
good,Great company to work for. Easy job nothing too hard. Great people around you to make you feel comfortable. Safe environment. Great pay. Over all a great experience.
good,"Hired me as a seasonal worker, with the opportunity of being hired on as a regular. They had no intentions on keeping me but they made sure they worked me throughout the peak season."
good,The work pace is fast. You have to be able to lift 50 pounds or more. You need to be able to interact with a computer system at the same time receiving and sorting items as required.
good,"I learned how to work with the sorting robots they have there and their different processes and color coding they had to separate items.  Overall the atmosphere was okay.  The people are not really friendly when you come in, but they warm up to you after a while."
good,Fine place to work fun place to work always have activities for the associates and the best pay so far. You don’t have to keep asking for permission to go home if you have enough paid time off you can stay home or not report at all and you still have your job.
good,Devo dire che la mia esperienza in Amazon è stata ottima
good,"good communication with management, amazon operators are nice people, team work is very important, solid RME team, easy going site, fun week themes, 4/10 shifts"
good,Fast paced warehouse where there is always something to do. Scanned packages for most of the night then loaded them into the delivery vehicles in the morning. Would have stayed if the hours didn't change but overall great part-time work.
good,Good org to work with. Had a decent experience.But non supportive teams caused lot of disturbance. Need to revise environment to be supportive. Rather management was not sure about whats happening in teams.
good,"Very work oriented but had an overall good time there. I learned a lot of technical skills during my time there, as far as how packages are shipped, the systems and methods used to expedite orders and software systems used to correctly manage the amount of merchandise collected and shipped in BNA5."
good,"Work hard, create history and have fun is the amazon's work policy. Being part of amazon has given me marvellous experience as an employee by delivering the best to the customers."
good,"easy heavy lifting job, just organize packages to be picked up by the delivery vans in the morning. easiest 15 an hour job, very relaxed no real supervision from supervisors."
good,"I was excited to be selected as an employee for Amazon and could not wait to get started. I was in constant communication with the HR Manager before I got hired. Then reality hit..my day one was horrible. Once I got started, she never spoke to me unless I said something and act like we had never talked. We walked in the building together I didnt realize it was her and she never said a word to me. Very hurtful. ... the potential for training was addressed but never followed through. I really feel that if I was in another building I would still be employed with Amazon. I am eligible for rehire but every time I apply no interview."
good,"buen ambiente laboral, preocupación por los colaboradores y exelentes turnos"
good,My typical day is nice. I learned about the warehouse industry. Management was good. Work culture was good. Hard part of the job was short slide. And the most enjoyable part of working for amazon was the people I had pleasure of working with.
good,"Working at the Fulfillment Center was fun but you are there to work, I worked in 2 different departments one was pretty strict about the time on task the other was not."
good,"great place to work, other associates became like extended family. cross training was great because when work was slow in one department they didnt just send you home, they would just move you to another so you got your hours."
good,"I was lucky to meet good leaders who helped to advance my career from customer service to corporate sales, a two level jump. Despite the company's size there is still an entrepreneurial mindset on the teams that develop products."
good,Work life balance is great. I enjoy my current role as a learning coordinator. I get to interact with new associates weekly some at the managerial level or higher.
good,"Your work day is very structured. Clock in, stretch.  Go to your work station, work till break time. Take your break, go back to work till lunch then go back to work after lunch until the next break time. Take your break, go back to work until your shift ends. Pretty boring."
good,an und für sich ist Amazon ein toller arbeit Geber.Nur steht dort die Menschlichkeit nicht wirklich im Vordergrund da dort viel auf die zahlen geschaut wird.Aber denn noch gibt es auch dort bereiche die Spaß machen mir zum beispiel. hat das entladen der Container sehr viel Spaß gemacht weil es eine körperlich anstrengende arbeit ist .Kurz und knapp gesagt ich würde immer wieder gerne zu Amazon zurück kommen.
good,Amazon is on their numbers but that’s because customers are number one priority so they ensure all orders get out on time with no quality damage either.
good,Amazon is a great place to work. The management was ok but the trainer I had did not really help me and I got very discouraged but over I loved working for the company but it just wasn't the fit for me at the time.
good,"I worked as a seasonal temp twice, and was a full time ""Amazonian"" for a year. I quit due to health issues."
good,"The environment is very comfortable, there is no dress code, so most people come to work wearing a t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops. Every day is day one, this is the motto and is very true. Working here is a lot of fun as there are often competitions, such as dressing up. You learn a lot of values here and there is opportunity to grow within the company by working hard."
good,Molto attenti per quanto riguarda le norme di sicurezza.
good,I enjoyed working there and I wish the place never shut so I could of continued to work there. I found the hours were good and the management was good with my circumstances.
good,"Best platform for a college graduate to start the career. The work environment is very fast-paced, and people in the company are very smart. You can learn a lot from the job."
good,"This company has a bad reputation that is not exactly merited. Yes, the entry level positions are designed to eliminate people who do not have a strong work ethic or desire to be productive without constant supervision. However, if I were to own a business I would want self-motivated employees in my company as well. There are no other companies in my area that offer full benefits from day one for entry level positions. Management can be aloof at times, most likely because they are spread thin, but all one has to do is ask and the management team will make themselves available. The training process could be more thorough, however, common sense is key in this environment. The most difficult part of the job is the timed breaks. Nobody likes to be micromanaged especially at break times. I believe this level of micromanagement comes from the lack of a constructive hiring process. The most enjoyable aspect of the job for me was the ability to constantly move and lose weight as I worked and got paid."
good,"Being contracted to Amazon as been a blessing for me with the securitas company, as many of their other contracts dont get the pay or the benefits that I get working here."
good,For this to be my first time working in a warehouse I enjoyed it. There's a lot to learn and great people to work with. It can be a great experience for someone who is able to work standing for the entire shift. There's opportunities to learn each department and make customers happy by fulfilling their orders.
good,"It's a pretty decent place to work, but you have to be fast enough or the line backs up. Everyone there is pretty helpful and are happy to show you how to do something. There's always prizes to when for productivity and great attendance."
good,"Internet based retail sales warehouse great work environment. Extremely fast work place, heavy lifting, lots of walking, and daily quotas. Wonderful incentives for employees. Great place for careers opportunities"
good,Continuous Improvement in the people skills is must. The managers need to appreciate the suggestions rather than discussing the negation of the situation.
good,It was very tiring for the first few weeks but it got better over time working there. It was fast paced sometimes but it was manageable for someone to do.
good,"Such a great work place, management is really nice, i learn team work and how improves my comunications skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was the picking time."
good,"Alta, la empresa realiza acciones que facilitan la comunicación con los compañeros sin que se tenga la sensación de que uno se encuentra en un entorno totalmente laboral."
good,it was ok when i was working there i enjoyed it. but the manager let me go i was so hurt.i wish i can go back but they hours dont fit well with my kids school.
good,"A typical day at work. was fast paced but mainly fun. I learned a lot. I love that its so diverse , came across a lot of good people. Thank you for the opportunity."
good,"Good pay for the required skill. Allowed employees to relax when able to, and the lunch room was nice.I enjoyed going to work because of my co-workers there, we made it fun even though it was a stressful time during Christmas."
good,"Lacked wok life balance since we work from home, you get paid for 40 hours but sometimes you work 60-70 a week. we still get messages at all hours of the night on our days off."
good,"trabajo físico duro, cambios de jornada y turno semanales."
good,This is a hardworking job. you will have to use time management and full body work. Great pay and reliable managers and helpful employees. I enjoy working here!
good,"Clock in, receive daily briefing from managers, stretch, check the board to see what location your sorting, write down numbers on racks for sortation, sort packages based on numbers, pull racks for drivers, and pull empty racks to the back."
good,"My review of amazon was that the job itself was very fast paced . You are under a lot of pressure , not many breaks but it was all worth it .  A typical day in the life of an amazon employee does require a lot of dedication.  The hardest part about the job is that you are standing for 10-12 hours ."
good,"A typical day at Amazon was overall pretty good for me. The pay was amazing and genuinely cannot be matched elsewhere. My job as a green badge instructor who had been cross- trained on the Pick, Pack, Hazmat, Stow (for inbound and outbound) was pretty demanding. The FC as a whole would provide a DPMO rating to each an individual employee (If these standards were not met the employee would be subject to one of three warnings) Overall, I loved my time at Amazon and certainly would recommend for anybody to get a job here. The pay grade is just too good to miss out on. The best part of the job in my opinion would have been the subsidised canteen that would offer stupidly lo prices for food and drinks. Many other perks were that the vending machines for PPE and Drinks (hot) were always free."
good,Amazon Flex program is just want it sounds like. FLEXIBLE! As a student and freelance videographer it works perfectly with my schedule and is very useful to fill the gaps between video jobs.
good,"Amazon is a great company, if you don't mind working hard. The hours, especially peak season hours, are exhausting, but you are made to feel appreciated."
good,"Working for Amazon is incredible and valuable on a personal level. The problem is that in order to make enough money to live and meet expenses, one must advance to a level that work completely overtakes one's life. It has to be the only thing you want to do to make it worthwhile. Not recommended for parents."
good,"Amazon is a great and loving company to work for. I really enjoyed working for this company. Amazing benefits, awesome management, great co-workers, and even better compensation and opportunities .The performance metrics can be a little unsettling; but otherwise a good place to work."
good,I enjoyed working there pay good good hours and they provide transportation only problem is u got to be fast cause if not your number will be low and that cause problems for you
good,"A+ Great place to work, plenty of work, fast paced environment, management seemed to want to keep people down not elevate, workplace culture on 1st shift was great 3rd shift was horrible"
good,"typical day included, receiving packages send back from the customers and examine them if they are good enough to be send back to the shop or had to be resolved such as cleaned or reduced in price."
good,"La empresa es muy buena y con mucha seguridad. Lo único malo es que no tienes un jefe directo cuando trabajas en el wharehouse."
good,This company is the best with a very good working culture but I am still waiting to see how good their salaries will look like when it comes to UAE salary range.
good,"Was very fast paced always a lot of work to do to make sure that you were on top of things. They always wanted you working and. It slacking off. They wanted to keep you busy at all times"
good,I enjoyed my time working there. My boss was fair and encouraging and helpful.  I worked at Amazon as a contracted employee so I did not receive benefits.
good,Last shift usually ended early not always a good thing if counting on hours long lines to get through for breaks due to security they did not have a dress code better to make sure tags were current as I seen a lit of cars getting toed
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, however I wouldn't recommend for anyone that is struggling with any health issues. Long standing, walking for numerous of hours depending on work requirements."
good,"fast pace, always busy, friendly staff & employees, the best part was the end how everybody works together in coordinating where each pallet is directed"
good,I came into work at 6:30pm-5:00am and it was very stressful because i was on my feet for 11 hours but we had breaks in between its just the being on your feet nonstop. I learned to rest and drinks lots of water in between i hours of work and also the management there in the work place wasn't as good as i thought. The manager has his days but he does workouts for the people with very bad health issues. The hardest part of the job was just being on your feet but overall amazon is very easy you just have to have the patience for it but overall i enjoyed amazon and i will go back and work for you guys. Thanks For The Best Work Experience.
good,"Amazon.com is a great place to work if you enjoy not talking to anyone, which for me is amazing! Everyone is focused on placing as many packages on pallets as they can before their shift is over. It’s great exercise as well, since there’s lots of walking back and forth from conveyor belt to pallet. During break, they let you go to the cafeteria and relax. There’s microwaves for home cooked meals and there’s drinks and snacks in case you’re looking for a quick bite. The only bad part is the length of the break: 15 minutes. Then again, it was only a seasonal job."
good,While working at amazon I discovered that they hired people from many different cultures and we all was able to work well as a team and as well by our selves
good,"It was an easy job with simple tasks assigned. I learned the procedures for 2 positions (Stow & Pack). The management I didn't interact with much because we had other employees who were used for help. The culture was very relaxed as far as dress code and the people. The hardest part would have been the mandatory overtime of 20+ hours, especially if it's on short notice. The most enjoyable part would be the people I worked with. It was easy to establish good relations with everyone."
good,"If the manager or higher is a good one you will live it there, if not turn over rate will be high. The biggest problem is not bring treated like person but more like a piece of equipment"
good,"very friendly, to the point, each day was presented within production and bottom line requirements. "
good,Amazon is a fast paced company and you have to keep up or get left behind. There’s room for growth but it’s solely based upon you. Amazon is on the cutting-edge
good,Very organized and reliable job well paid and the manager were very responsible. The timetable was benficial for the worker so he could get and education.
good,Hard work makes it fun work. Fun place to work the people are great. They have awesome benefits. Which is a plus. Plenty of time to use to take off as well.
good,I kept the job for the benefits as long as I could. The pay was great... Benefits start the moment you sign the paperwork for the job. If you want to move up within the company I hope you know someone who can make that happen for you.
good,"Amazon provides a very fast paced environment, where employees are given the opportunity to advance and learn. Amazon has a very strong workplace culture."
good,"Poor management communication,  they tell you for different area training but never happened,  very strict in some areas, if you make one mistake you loose your job.  some areas are safety hazard,  once in a while they will talk about safety, expects associates to be safe but never talk about what Co. is doing for associates safety."
good,If your not willing to work 12 hrs shifts or dont drink plenty water this is not the job for you. Pay is great and management is great they work with you.
good,They have free medicine like Tylenol and ibuprofen through the warehouses for their employees they also  feminine products in the restrooms for women. The 4 days on 3 days off was a plus for me.
good,Entreprise où on aime y travailler la formation est complète et la sécurité est primordiale
good,Just make sure you stay at your station. It is best to listen to your managers and follow the rules or you could get in trouble or even written up. Stay focused too.
good,Keep your head down. Do your job and you'll be fine. remember to ask for help if there is something that you do not understand. and do not be a jerk to the people who work in learning.
good,I work with some of the smartest people in the world. The intensity and pace of work is very challenging and the compensation is generous to make up for this fact. There is a big problem with the availability of promotions and advancement and that is the only reason I have ever looked outside of the company.
good,"I worked the reduced time schedule. Thurs - Sat 6:30PM-7AM"
good,"Being a driver for Amazon Flex is one of the best jobs I've had. the pay is amazing and it is a very easy and rewarding job. However since the implementation of the service in the Tampa Bay Area, there have been many changes that have taken me from a very active driver within the community to not having been able to get many hours within the the past year. if you can dedicate your work week to watching an app and waiting for offers to come though and accept them before others do you can potentially have 3 day work weeks, otherwise you might not get any hours at all."
good,"This is an independent delivery job, NOT Amazon.com.  The delivering is easy and goes quick and there is money to be made.  The pace is fast and you have to make sure to complete the routes and deliver your packages"
good,"Amazon is a good place to work. Long hours, great pay, work sign a lot of people, always work to do, excerize, and new systems, great benefits........"
good,But got forced down to flex which means I’m not full time anymore and I really need a full time job.  It was the only way they would let me loose my “seasonal” title.
good,Good place to work but management expected too much out of the employees and didn’t compensate for the work performed. They put too much on their employees to work harder and harder each and everyday.
good,Mi valoración es buena pero exigían mucha produccion
good,"it was a great job for a seasonal employment. i was slightly exhausted but i only noticed when i was done working, i liked the organization and how after one or two days of training i could work on my own. its a great part time job. It would not be so great if your looking for big paychecks it was 4-5 hour shift."
good,You are required to work at a fast pace while being productive and accurate. They do have a great benefits package that starts day one. Work is long yet they find ways to make it fun.
good,I met a lot of people and I also had to deal with a lot of customers who would be mad and happy. What I learn during that job was how to approach costumers.
good,"The work at amazon is fast paced and not the easiest work, but they are one of the safest places to work as well as providing good compensation for the work."
good,"Stay to yourself. Walk fast. Bring your lunch. Dress cool it gets HOT!!! Keep a bottled water. Have a good bladder building is huge. Stay on top of your hours missed. Communicate with management and hr team about any problems. Wear your gloves. Have awesome sneakers, maybe a half size larger. Great workout. Job has its cool perks that makes it fun. Don't take nothing personal. Stay to yourself."
good,"The work environment is outstanding as long as you are not stowing. This job has little to do with your abilities. It is 100% based on the products you receive to stow. You are instructed to ""not cherry pick,"" while stealthy informed it may cost you your job if you don't! On being discharge I was informed that I had grounds to appeal due to strong scoring in the ""middle items"" area. I considered it, but felt that it would foolish to return to the conditions."
good,I worked in the Indy node for a year and a half and loved the people and the work in a true team environment. Everyone in Controls and Maint. willing to help and learn together. I do not recommend the Hebron node much different environment.
good,"Working with my team to be number one in rates, quality and performance. Making sure we have expectations for everyone from day 1! Coaching people from bottom & top performers to learn new skills and methods to pass on to everyone else"
good,"I learned a lot from my time at Amazon. I had multiple roles and benefited from all the experience I got from working in different departments of the business. "
good,"Excellent benefits, hourly rate not so good. Great co-workers. Some good management. Need to hire within more rather than hiring College degreed people with no logistics experience."
good,"a day as an amazon employee . "
good,"Working with Amazon has been an awesome journey., Fun to work at Amazon. Incredible work environment. Stress free working culture. No pressure to work."
good,Amazon is continually encouraging people to advance or at least try to. They have a rigid evaluation system which is helpful but isn't a legitimate representation of a Representative's actual ability. They have built in flaws in the system one of which I helped fix and the others I presented many better ways to evaluate employees that may have been taken over by others after I left.
good,Me gustaba trabajar en amazon me sentía realizada.Los superiores fueron siempre muy agradables conmigo y respetuosos.El trabajo que hacía me gustaba mucho.
good,"Every job is different, lots of opportunities to transfer positions. Have options to help pay for college and career advancement in some fields. Job can get boring if you don't like to work alone."
good,"Working at an Amazon fulfilment center is pretty easy, decent pay, long hours in the peak season between November and January, but still the job is easy. If you have physical problems like knee or back issues, I'd suggest fixing those before attempting to work at a fulfillment center. Other than that, the job is simple. Supervisors and Managers can easily ruin your day if you let them."
good,"Great Job, Needs Benefits Package. a typical day at work is 30-45 packages being delivered in a timely manner. I learned that amazon is better suited as a second job rather than a primary job. the workplace culture is great, everyone is very helpful. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid twice a week."
good,"Una empresa con una gran estabilidad."
good,"During the initial training, you are given a two week training period and a minimum number of driver calls only. After they have used their algorithm to discern their most successful agents, they reassign and retrain them to deal with customer service concerns at the delivery end of the Amazon Logistics service. You are given a single full day to train for customers, and then given customer calls, which can vary from customer complaints, lost or missing items, or deliveries going to the wrong locations among the most popular. If you are attentive you can succeed and advance in this environment, even from the comfort of home."
good,"Good job with plenty of physical activity, good pay, and opportunity for advance. Team work is encouraged and the building is well kept and clean. Supervisors are always available to assist with improving job skills and willing to help with performing tasks."
good,Great place to learn in a fast paced environment. Amazon teaches you the importance of their customers smile and the quality of professionalism while having fun doing your job.
good,"A typical day at work included talking to customers and solving issues, there were many meetings, and there were teams of people working together. The hardest and easiest part of the job is working from home. It's easy wit no commute, wearing pajamas to work. It's hard because it is easy to get into hermit mode, where you never leave the house. Not a good job for people with depression, as it can exacerbate symptoms."
good,"The work is consistent and the training can get anyone into the position as long as you are a people person. The strict rules around security mean that you cannot leave a hardwired location to work remotely. You work from home. The breaks are evenly spaced out and are (2) 15 min breaks and an hour lunch, or for my 10 hour days, (2) 45 min lunches. If you miss any punches, or anything happens to cause you to be late, you have to use a limited amount of unpaid time to make up for it. It is all metric based, so you are a number in a group of numbers. The managers are human though, and they tend to work with you to make sure that you can perform and nothing is hindering your way, via training, consults, meetings, and other resources. It is a fun, different way to work, and would be great for stay-at-home types. The pay is very very basic, but permanent employees get great benefits."
good,"Working with Amazon for close to 4years has been absolutely wonderful and has contributed a great deal to my learning - professionally and personally. Amazon stands by its tag line - Work Hard, Have Fun and Make History. Every individual is given opportunities to prove his/her potential. Ideas and Innovations are welcomed since Amazon believes in constant process improvements through simplification. This builds opportunities for for employees to grow into young leaders and also create some history!"
good,It was a good place for me to start working in America after migration. Friendly work environment. Learned a lot from my coworkers. No discrimation work place.
good,Hours are long. more than 10 a shift. Only working a 4 day per week schedule. Lots of standing and walking around the facility. Pay was nice. Hours were never messed with and you receive all your benefits on day one. What more could you ask for?
good,"It’s a decent job. The frustration comes in when they are cutting hours because it’s slow (VTO Voluntary Time Off) but steadily hiring and scheduling new people. You end up being pressured to go home, unpaid. During “Peak” and “Prime Week” you work 60 hrs. Either 6 10hr shifts or 5 12hr shifts. The benefits are awesome and start on day one. It is physically demanding as you’re on your feet for 10-12 hrs. I pick in a robotic facility so we don’t walk to the bins - they come to us. There are fun competitions and a huge amount of prizes for Peak. We got a $50 Amazon gift card for perfect attendance during perfect attendance week."
good,Overall good company for starting after recently graduating. Work life balance is ok but sometimes you are working 6 days a week having only one holiday. Otherwise good company to work.
good,"This job required me to use great time management, organization, and personal relations skills. I was also able to use my experience as an actor when on set with the director, and learn a lot about production from the other side of the camera."
good,"Amazon.com is a very good company to work for and with, and an excellent opportunity to meet people of all types and to travel. there are many different jobs with this up- and coming company, and the staffing of facilities is well managed"
good,Fast paced work environment with decent pay. Great people working all around with a smile ready to great you. Great management that's always striving to help its employees.
good,"Very physical demanding job, constant moving. Very strict on time and rates. Must be sufficient and make sure you’re reading everything and have all the qualities it tells you"
good,"Amazon Studios is a great place for screenwriting, They offer tools like Story Builder and Screen Writer. It is really useful even if you don't end up getting accepted."
good,"Amazon s a fun environment, however it is very cut throat. you have to keep up with rates, and job is very repetitive. Peak season you are overwork with little to no extra incentives."
good,"* Great learning opportunities"
good,Amazon is always moving forward and no holds are placed in your way to complete projects. From day one you are dropped in to figure it out. There is little help along the way and you must always look after yourself. This leads to a fairly stressful workplace with co-workers that move at an extreme pace. This is a build your own career type of workplace.
good,amazon left my small city of fernley to move to reno and i was unable to follow  its better that all those people dont have to drive that highway during winter
good,Amazon is a very fast paced job and a great place to work. The pay is good but the hours are very long. Overtime is sometimes mandatory and can happen at any time. Overall I would recommend it
good,"It really is a great job with great benefits. Amazon opens a lot of job opportunities to people, seeing as how the sometimes hire 4000 people at a time. Give it a try!"
good,"A typical day at amazon would be starting off with scanning a numerous amount of boxes and placing them on special palets until break."
good,I was only here for 3 months and the beginning was amazing I loved the job but some of the management could of been more willing to help me when I told them I didn't understand instead of being so quick to judge
good,Great and fun work place with great management.Room for growth.The hours was great.I have learned a lot especially  about how packages were prepared to be shipped out.
good,"Depends on where you begin docks, stowing, etc,etc. Not complaining but working for 10 hours a day while standing does take its toll and 30 minutes is not enough to sustain a average worker."
good,"Easy job as long as you stay on task.  You will use a scanner so there is accountability.  If you never deviate from doing your job and take no more than one bathroom break a shift you will make rate.  As long as you make rate you will rarely see your manager aside from positive talks like your birthday chat and open door meetings.  The pay is okay, but when you see the number of coworkers who DON'T pull their weight you see why that is.  Can be frustrating rebuilding pallets others collapse, so best if you are a relaxed individual that can operate fast-paced."
good,The work pace was fast so the 10 hour days felt fast but the work was also extremely repetitive and boring. Each warehouse is different but regardless they will teach you how to use the equipment that is available at that warehouse.
good,"Good company if you are young. Too fast of pace for older people."
good,"ok , It's better than most places that I have worked at. 10 hours per day , 4 days a week....Except during peak , then it's 10 hours a day , 6 days a week."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Amazon during peak season, because we were always busy, so it kept the day going by quick. But I hated the micro managing, and how they hold you accountable for not being trackingly productive when there is low work."
good,"I took the ""deal"" where you leave and get a bonus but can never come back. it was a $2000 voluntary quit deal. very unfair as i only got $600 of the $2000 and wish i could go back"
good,"The pay was great but if you have kids or want to balance your work life and social life this is not the job for you. Your body will hurt , no phones allowed so you cant check in on family. Theyre just too strict"
good,"Their is no typical day at work"
good,There is a variety of different job types here. The management team is usually very energetic and and attentive. The give unpaid time off that doesn't count against you if you wish to use it. Very fast paced which makes the 10 hour shift fly by.
good,"Working at the Amazon Fulfilment Centre was very convenient for me being only a mile away, working night shifts i was payed just under £10 and hour and 1.5x overtime rate, by my math picking for amazon will get you walking at minimum 16 miles per shift the nights are long and the work hard but the people in charge understand that, there are quite often oppurtunities to receive a day off with out penalty and being sick will not lose you your job (with-in reason). The supervisors expect a bit much from you sometimes but thats just their job. i would deffinetly go back no questions."
good,"Amazon is a very fast paced warehouse setting. It is also very demanding with 10 hour shifts and you are on your feet moving quickly as possible the entire shift. Be prepared to be extremely sore your first month or so In my opinion the $11.00 an hour base pay is much to low considering how physically demanding the job is and the expectations you are demanded to meet. However the benefits are AMAZING and the cost is very reasonable. There is a very high turnover rate at Amazon but that is because not everyone can handle working 40-55 hour work weeks when the job is this fast paced and on your feet, I would absolutely recommend working at Amazon to anyone. They really care about their employees and there is plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Great working environment for a young person, awesome workplace culture and a lot of opportunities for growth. The management team are open and approachable."
good,"Something I never thought I could do.  This job was very physical and I loved it.  Goals and expectations were clearly defined and easy to achieve.  Very little thought went into who they hired and some people didn't even get through one shift.  If you work, this job is just fine.  If you are lazy, you won't survive."
good,"The hours are unusual and the pay is not great but it is a fantastic place to work, you could be doing divers t things every day from stow and receiving to picking g and packing every day is different"
good,"have to meet strict criteria but very efficient work. overall, management very well to work for. peek season is by far the best due to raises, prizes, and more overtime available."
good,"Amazon has listed a motto ""Work Hard, Have Fun & Make History"" and I can confirm that they are living up to it each and every day, Amazon has been a wonderful place."
good,Amazon is a great fast paced dynamic place to work. The work life balance can get pretty crazy but if you're up for a workplace with constant growth opportunities it could be a great place to work.
good,The people when i was there were amazing to work for. The hours went by fast til the last couple of them..also a little fun fact there is a 27 mile long track for the items.
good,A typical day at work would be scanning packages all day long and wrapping pallets. When there is plenty of work it makes the work day go by very quick.
good,training is stressful however once you get through training it does get  better. I really would recommend it more if you weren't hired seasonal and having the wondering what if I don't  get to stay on after the seasonal period. I am headed into my third month and overall its been a great experience.
good,"Everybody always seems to be in a good mood and it's easy to make new friends. Everybody is willing to help out theur fellow associate. Management and supervisors are always willing to help out if it's ever needed. And they don't let a chance go by to keep you hydrated. There's water/drink machines around almost every corner. It's a warehouse, it gets hot, you sweat, they want to make sure you're hydrated. They even have urine color charts on the back of their bathroom stall doors so you can look at your own and make sure you're consuming enough h2o."

Are workplace culture was alright, we had a variety, we all got along just fine, in the beginning, some didn't talk, but we all became family. The best part about this is after a while we are able to save point to takes days off and not have them be accounted against us."

As a young worker a daily work day was just being able to do the same task repeatedly and sometimes having to be moved around and being placed at parts of the warehouse I wasn't familiar with but I was always trained well. "
good,"Amazon ha degli standard safety e quality molto alti,"
good,i loved working for amazon i enjoyed my daily task and i really enjoyed my co-workers. amazon looks out for its employee not like most warehouse jobs that seem like a sweat shop. there was always something to excite me about the next day.

good,"Remit includes day to day duties in a busy distribution centre, moving stock around manually and area readiness. Also, required to hit strict daily targets with significant attention to detail to avoid mistakes."
good,"I have been employed with amazon for a little over a year now, the work is not hard at all but you do stand on your feet for 10 hours a day. The pay is ok, but the benefits are great. They do reward you for your hard work and they try hard to listen to your concerns. They do a good job a catering to their employees."
good,"Amazon was a stressful job., but a fun place to work. Pay was comparable, benefits were good. I worked from home as part of the virtual call center. THe hours were difficult, however a shift differential was given."
good,Wish the pay was higher but overall the workplace is great. Managment needs work as they only hire new people to management they seem to stray from exsperiance
good,"It was good to start my career at Amazon.com. The workplace was good with different culture."

good,"You'd start in a start up meeting with your manager and everyone in your department"
good,"I have been there for years. However no advancement possible. Management and co-workers great! But due to Time difference between Central and Eastern Time zone, I am ready to get up at 4:00 Am or later instead of 2:00AM, like I have for the past 6 years."
good,"long hours, but really good to work for, enjoyed packing, line work,"
good,"Says it all in the title.  Very good higher ups but some weakness in mid level management which makes advancement and navigating the company difficult.  Have to be extremely self starting and able to deal with a lot of ambiguity, chart your own path."
good,"Amazon is a decent place to work with full befefits right off the bat."
good,Great place to work and the work was very easy. Management and HR could use some improving when it comes to handling issues with associates. Hardest part was the first week on the job getting your body used to walking a lot and lifting.
good,"The company was excellent, but the staffing company they hired workers from has incredibly bad clashing rules often, often causing integrity to give write ups to employees, Amazon is great, but they need a better staffing company for seasonal."
good,"The warehouse associate/order picker job is somewhat easy. But the work results into a lot of wear and tear on your body. So, they really should pay more than 10.50 an hour for 10 hours and day of straight labor. Your literally lifting something heavy all day. "
good,You get to meet people from all over and its very sociable and great Team player oriented environment. Fast pace and quick changes

good,"casual dressup"
good,"The job was not a normal warehouse job, it was working with a system called comp. My job there was to scan undelivered parcels which were brought back by drivers, and scan them back to station, making sure the status was correct. I had to learn the entire system, and knew it like the back of my hand. It gets really busy as drivers start flowing in and have to wait in a que whilst we process each parcel correctly. for example drivers come back and say that a parcel was rejected, or damaged or that they delivered the parcel but forgot to put delivered on their system, so we would have to fix it to the correct status."
good,It's all about the customers.  Packages must be delivered to them.  On the night shift it is imperative that everything goes out and everything is processed accordingly.
good,good job love management just really not any room to move up being that the positions are always full. hours can be unpredictable. Might get off an hour early might be an hour late you will never know
good,"Need to hire more permanent workers,vs seasonal associates. New employees are moved to different jobs before being properly trained in one area."
good,"There's evidence that people who have fun at work are happier, healthier, motivated, and more productive than their stressed-out counterparts."
good,very fun environment with a great staff that is willing to help with any problems. Help make me a better team player. Work is usually busy but at the same time manageable. We have the opportunity to deliver customer's order within 1 hour or 2 hours.
good,As the usual I make my rounds throughout the entire warehouse my job is to make sure all merchandise are in the right location as in the Data entry and label etc. As other started to noticed who I really was they start rumors because I have to report back to my supervisor if this wasn't in the correct area and so forth. And it's not I was a snitch I was doing my job so to resolve the problem I would inform the workers that are responsible to put merchandise where it's suppose to be and recheck before documenting it on their charts. When I did that it made both sides easier for me to not spend so much time to find where certain merchandise goes. And saves the co workers to not get written up so much. That's my most enjoyable part of the job is working together as a time because it's the only way to get work done and correctly.
good,Dynamic and energetic place to work that is constantly changing. Management is very supportive and willing to work with people.
good,Through this job I gained warehouse experience as well as discipline. I had to learn to stay awake and work hard in a 40+ hour work week.The management There was really good. They made sure that all of their employees were always on task and meeting company rates. The hardest part of the job was the amount of hours you were required to work a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was payday. I loved seeing my checks at the end of all the hard work.
good,"a Typical day at work would be assisting customers with the queries they have.I have learned to have patience when dealing with customer, co-workers were brialliant to work with we actualy still in contact even after I left. most enjoyable part of the has to be being able to solve the customers query and make them happy."
good,"Phenomenal company with a lot of potential for growth and development. Most rewarding part of the job was solving problems and working with customers (internal and external) to reach the best solutions for everyone. No two projects were the same, lots of innovation and change to try and manage at the speed of business."
good,"Amazon was a great company to start with with a great working atmosphere."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Amazon. I remotely worked on a project here so wasn't part of the day to day office culture, but had excellent support from coworkers and management,"
good,"Not a fun place to work at, but there is always something that made it worth while. I learned that the management cant work together if they don't communicate. The co-workers were always friendly and stayed busy working. Hardest part was having to go up and down stairs before and after breaks.The enjoyable part of working, was just being able to work."
good,"My typical day at work is to greet my fellow employers and co-workers, smile with a Great big hello daily."
good,"Empresa comprometida, organizada quando  se trata de bem-estar."
good,The work day would start by checking what job you were assigned to do. There were many jobs to do at the warehouse but 90 percent of the time would be spent sorting packages. The work load was heavy but it easy which was extremely productive.
good,The atmosphere at Amazon was fun and engaging. My manager was not very personable but other thn that everyone was fun to work with
good,At amazon its fun working at. Walk and stand for 10 hours. What I did at work was Order picker and checking items if they were don' damaged.
good,"I love working at amazon, great pay great benefits. awesome work environment. A lot of ways to advance throughout the company as long as you put in 110%"
good,I would fill several baskets with online orders for shipping.  I learned better time management because I had to go all over the warehouse to fill the orders and managing my time was very important.  I got along with all my co workers and they were helpful when I needed help.  The hardest part was getting used to the warehouse and how to find everything but once I learned it I had no problems.
good,"everyone there was in good cheers. the staff was good and they took really good care of their employees."
good,Amazon could be a little funnier to work there but its what you make it.
good,I enjoyed working here. If I had the opportunity to become a permanent member of staff I would have strongly considered accepting a permanent role.

good,hardworking and fun you get what you put in. and they are very helpful.
good,I love working for Amazon.com.  They allow you the ability to be very creative and have an impact on the whole organization.  In turn though it is a very fast paced environment and you either sink or swim.
good,Overall i enjoyed working for amazon but felt they did a terrible job promoting within. They tended to go with people with degrees that had no warehouse experience rather then go with people that knew the job and had worked long and hard to be able to advance. And had a terrible sense of the politics that went on in different departments promoting friends and so on. But i will say it was a very safe place to work at. They preached safety to the fullest extent and made sure workers drank enough and stretched plenty.
good,Great Management with room for many ideas from team that were put into play.
good,"Working for Staff Management was a wonderful experience, learning a lot about Amazon's expectations, safety awareness and one on one communication with the associates on a daily basis."
good,Amazon was a fun but fast paced environment. They allow you to assist customers rather than focusing on what the customer can be sold.
good,"Amazon.com is a very good company and job culture of this company is also good. that's why, i didn't get any typical day at my work. From Amazon.com, I have learned that how to work in MNC Company. My self confidence is also increase."
good,"Store and receive boxes, clean area very fast pace. What I have learned is that each warehouse have different methods of sending and receiving packages. The co-workers were very interesting."
good,"A typical work day consisted of 10hr shifts of constant work. Every shift required physical labor. During my time at Amazon I learned how to quickly achieve objectives while maintaining active attention to detail. The management staff was constantly on top of the success rate and performance of my actions. The hardest part of the job would have to be building perfect pallets 6 feet high, solid and square with oddly shaped items at a face pace. I enjoy having consistent responsibilities throughout the day so that was the best part about the job."
good,"Amazon was a great company to work for and I was very happy, but they did not have a lot of room for advancement within the company,"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work: you can show up basically whenever you want to; you can take pretty much any days off you need to; you will always be treated like an adult, and you will never be micromanaged."
good,it was very enjoyable working at amazon.co.uk. i only regret that i was only temporary at the company.
good,"Such a lovely company to work for, and also everybody there treats you like family. Best company I've ever worked for that made me feel like that in such a long time"
good,"This was a very different job then I am use to, It was also done on a seasonal basis. Everyone is pushed to work has fast has you can so a typical day there is work hard and fast, very quiet except for all of the machines running . Most of the Management was very helpful. You only see co-workers in passing or on breaks they are hard workers no one really gets to know anyone. The fast pace for 12hrs. is hard to get use to."
good,"Buckle up, you work long hours with high expectations but the financial rewards are there."
good,"Customer service, incoming calls and resolving incidences"
good,"Amazon was a great place to work there was always work for me when i went in. It was really enjoyable to work there as i was always on the go and working hard. The main role of my job was a picker, i was shown how to use the picking gun and made aware that there was a time set and a target i had to achieve before the time had ran out. The staff at amazon were very helpful if ever i had an issue i could go speak to them. The hardest part of my job would have been pulling a full tote back to the allocated area. I enjoyed every minute of my job, its the right job for me."
good,The managers made sure that all employees were comfortable and safe. If at anytime something was wrong they made sure you were ok and safe. During holidays it was a stressful place to work but they made sure we were all comfortable and tried to add fun to ease the stress.
good,"A day at work would be long and hard but satifying. I have learned alot about production and customer needs. Also, I have learned how to safely opperate PIT."
good,I liked being a receiver my co-workers were great I learned a lot in the warehouse industry the hardest thing is that we had to work 6 days a week and got off late but other than that it was a good place to work
good,"Since I first joined Amazon, the company has been a pleasure to work for. Management is very focused on aiming for the highest standards in customer service obsession. Currently I am part of the Executive Customer Relations team and we handle high visibility escalated publisher issues. The job involves working with Senior management and technical teams to look at improving business processes to create a more seamless publisher experience. Currently the hardest part of my job is the working hours. Due to the fact that you have to work with various teams around the world, I often have to stay at work very late to resolve issues and this often does leave an imbalance in work and personal life. I work with great people that push you to think outside the box. They also allow you the scope to make changes and decisions to handle various situations. The best part of my job is the fact that I am a front line ambassador for the brand and each day I'm given the opportunity to improve customer relations."
good,"You go threw the turnstiles put your personal stuff in your locker. Cannot take anything with you on the work floor. Grab a scanner gun and wait for ""stand up"", the meetings they have twice a day; one in the beginning of the day and the other after lunch. After the meeting you work on your feet. 2 hours and 15 minutes later you get a 15 minute break. You are responsible if you don't start picking after 19 minutes. As long as you can keep up with the expectations they have of 125 units an hour, you will have a job."
good,"A typical work day at amazon.com fulfillment center on the outbound department will consist of order picking, packing and shipping dock. I work in all three areas. During my time in Amazon I learn many leadership skill and communication skills. Management at Amazon is great, they help you grow and help you increase leadership skills. The hardest part of the job is the physical demands. I work four days ten hours shift. You stand all of the ten hours and ways around 15 to 20 miles a shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers I worked with a great group of associates."
good,"i love working at amazon , i would perfer to work during the day "
good,It was very up beat consistant work flow...But the management only cares about themselves...Alot of the permanent workers take their job for granted and part-time workers do most if not all thework. Loved working for the company.
good,"Arrving at amazon in the am and start looking for things that have to be done . Placing the co workers in different areas so they can get started with their area. i also do inventory and talk to the employees about ther schedule and other situations they might have with there job.

I learned alot of stuff there like how to pick/pack groceries, how to cut/pack various types of deli meats and cheeses and how to problem solve issuses that came about through out the work day. The managment team was great. They really knew how to make it a super workable environment. My co-workers became some of my closest friends during and even away from work. the hardest part of the job was getting used to working graveyard as the most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction and friendlyness everyone had with each other."
good,There are many opportunities for advancement within this company. They were helpful in making adjustments for my school schedule. Overall this is a great company to work for.

good,"I really enjoy the work. All the jobs feel like a fun game, and there is some variety, and during peak, you can even pick your preferred job. On a typical day, we scan boxes to pallets, then wrap the pallets, then move the pallets to the staging area near the truck doors, then do lane readiness. During peak, we would also sort packages and boxes as they came down the conveyor belt. I am working at the limits of my physical capacity everyday and feel very healthy and have lost weight. The other workers come from all socioeconomic groups and walks of life, including students and retired people. Most people seem to be in a good mood. I am always happy to go to work. However, I do not see any path upwards. It is a very flat pay structure. Even the people with better titles and more responsibility seem to also be making $15/hour just like the new people."
good,"Amazon is an good paying job, just bad at treating people like people. For example i got let go because i had to take my brother to the hospital...i had a documents proving my where about but they didn’t want to see it because they dont care."

good,I’ve worked at amazon it’s and awesome just and love what I do just looking for another job that pays more time to find something new that will help with the future of mine

good,"I enjoy going to work driving for amazon it’s not hard, and everyone is very helpful."
good,"Amazing company and amazing benefits, but pay could be more then what there offering at the time that I was there. Its pay is if not comparable or lower then other jobs in the area. Great benefits for yourself and your family and they push quite a bit but sometimes take home is more important then benefits depending on a persons situation."
good,"No second chances. Not all management is on the same page. It's rough when a select few ruin the experience for the majority. Great company to work for, excellent benefits, poor management"
good,Good pay horrible hours 12 hour shifts are taxing. Get 3 30 minute breaks that help but the warehouse is really big hard to get to the break room fast. Fun environment though. Going to tell you not for everybody
good,"je travaillais peandant pas mal de temps chez amazon, le souci c'est qu'on peut te mettre en fin de mission sans réel cause, du moment où la tête de client de passe pas..."
good,"Stayed busy throughout entire shift"

good,Great company and great people to work with always wanted to be there always helping out everyone they would to me to go home that's how much I wanted to be there
good,"Ottimo ambiente lavorativo, buona organizzazione e ottimo lavoro di squadra. Avrei preferito lavorare qualche giorno in più alla settimana... Qualche soldo in più fa sempre comodo."
good,"I've been with Amazon for 8 years. Almost everyone I work with is very high-caliber and I have learned from them constantly since signing on. The work can be intense - and some teams are more demanding than others, but by-and-large if you want to work at large tech company, learn about scale from talented people, and get decent compensation for it Amazon's a solid choice."
good,"Luogo di lavoro molto istruttivo, e soddisfacente."
good,"Ambiente stimolante, e sempre in working progress...io ho 50 anni pertanto fungerò da jolly ma i ragazzi con buona volonta saranno certamente appagati..."
good,I work at home on a team called the reserves. Minimum hours per week is 4. Max hours is 40. Equipment is provided. Training is at home by yourself. Training segments are timed. I take calls from customers.
good,"Great as a 1st time Job, since there very difficult to develop a carrier"
good,This is a best platform for internet e-commerce line job and learn many more from here with senior and managers... good culture ....work hard have fun make history..
good,Tutto bello tranne la durata  del contratto. Peccato non poter ritornare.
good,"Good p/t job. Flexible hours. Independent work. "
good,"Mi sono trovata benissimo a lavorare in Amazon. C'è collaborazione e si sente veramente il lavoro di squadra."
good,"Es un método de trabajo que te tiene que gustar, al principio es chocante, cada día se hacen briefing, que son sesiones informativas de lo que tenemos que producir ese dia, se hacen calentamientos para empezar a trabajar sin sufrir ninguna lesión, todo esto con sentido del humor del manager y leads. El descanso es de 30min a medio turno. En el salario es lo único que no estoy deacuerdo, 12 pagas, ninguna doble y con pocas opciones a hacer horas pagadas. Después de todo, si te gusta,trabajas (porque Amazon es un trabajo como otro) y estás en el baremo que la empresa pide, tienes posibilidad de conversion."
good,Good Place To Work. I Liked It. I Had To Relocate Due To Personal Issues. Wish I Could’ve Stayed But..................................................
good,"Highly recommended"
good,"Excellent company to work for. Work/Life balance doesn't exist. You have to be available at some point 24/7. If you are single and want an opportunity to grow, this is a perfect place to be."
good,Working at Amazon is fun and there is lots to learn. The scale of everything is amazing. There are a lot of neat people around too. The managers work hard. I would recommend it to everyone looking to open their eyes to whatś really behind the internet.
good,"Typical day is depending on job function you have. Forklift operator, packing, unload trailers, and scanning packages. You have a limit of time to meet your goal. "
good,Amazon is very competitive and customer obsessed. They work is very physical and demanding. The health benefits are amazing and the best I've ever had.
good,"Excellent company for people to work at, there is a lot of fun activities running around throughout the year and the atmosphere is always really good for anyone working there."
good,Espero que siga creciendo se lo merece. Muy buenos pagos y calidad laboral.
good,"Awesome company to work with, good perks and a place where employees are valued. Great growth options, easy jump up the professional ladder. One of the best companies to work for."
good,"Friendly fun place to work. A completely different culture to handling customer service to any other company I've worked for."
good,This is my 3rd time working here. I love it so I keep going back. It is very fast paced but work it. No need to speak to others if you don’t want to...which I love.
good,"The job is fast paced,but you stay busy,which is definitely a positive.the people are great, and the job function is easy,if you're a quick learner,pick up on things fast."
good,"It's a good job with decent pay. Be prepared to work hard. It requires being on your feet for hours, walking on concrete, and lifting heavy boxes repeatedly."
good,"In the warehouse you are able to learn all the duties from receiving, unloading, distribution, quality control, stow, ect. Very fast paced system which I enjoy."
good,Everyone at AWS speaks the same values - Amazon Leadership Principals and being evaluated based on them. Its great environment for technical driven professionals with aspirations to help customers\partners to embrace cloud technologies with extreme high pace of innovation.
good,"Working at Amazon I learned to work fast under pressure, it was a repetitive task to do packaging items and placing them on the line but it was easy. I enjoyed the people in my work space and I always kept a smile on my face."
good,"Loved working here for 5 years. Communication can be frustrating, leadership and people move often so continuity is an issue. You drive your career here."
good,"learned to work the scanner"
good,even though some days weren't great we worked as a family and it was face pace. they did provide us with waters for the heat and routes were different every week and had to pay attention to detail
good,Amazon was a very high pace job that requires a lot of physical labor in order to meet your numbers and to get customers orders out quickly for same day shipping and next day delivery.
good,Ambiente buono bravi colleghi e responsabili presenti
good,"Only reason I’m no longer employed with amazon is because I had to move states unexpectedly. It was a great job, great schedule and great pay. If you can handle 12 hours on your feet it’s great. Plan on re-applying after the 365 day wait period"
good,"I am driving for Amazon temporarily until I find another position. I am only working four days a week, Friday thru Monday, 12:30 PM to 9:00 PM, but there is usually up to two hours Overtime. That shift doesn't leave much balanced time with family. The managers are great, but there is a huge disconnect with the schedulers in Seattle. Drivers have no input into actual conditions, and problems of our routes. After delivering during the Holiday Season in 2015, I see this a problem that will really make the job difficult and lead to problems."
good,I really enjoyed working at Amazon. It is a very physically demanding job and I loved it. I was able to work out while I was at work because of how physically demanding the job is. I learned as many different things and therefore I was able to be moved around to help out in any area that I was trained in. I signed up to be trained for everything that was offered.
good,"Great place to work. For those that like to work in warehouse this is a great place to be especially if your interested in the management branch."
good,"Can be a difficult job to have with the pace, quality of work and how much micromanagement there is to make sure goals and quality are accomplished.  On the positive side the checks are helpful and benefits are great."
good,It's a cool place to work and it's very nice associatesthere is no human resources in the building but managers can help you out with anything you need
good,"Amazon has really shaped my career to the top, providing learning and development courses on our knet app, everything I'm proud of today is because of Amazon, I love our culture and it's still day1"
good,"Amazon.com is a call center, but once you get used to talking on the phone all the time, it is a great place where the support is designed to help you help the customer. They do their best to take care of you so you can take care of the customer."
good,"- Every day is an opportunity to learn new topic on process."
good,Wonderful company to work with that is customer obsessed. Employee expectations are straight forward with an upbeat attitude. Offers 401k and insurance.
good,It was a really good place to work for everyone was always kind and in a helping mood. If you needed help you could ask any of the other employees or ambassadors for help.
good,Amazon is like a start up for any new employee. It gives them opportunity to run it as their own business. Need to adapt to Amazon's culture. All in all Its a great place to work
good,As you enter the  warehouse Can you clock in can you close the radio station and you have to work for two hours straight you can’t catch a break until the break starts it’s very physically demanding you have to be mentally ready to go to work.
good,"Amazon job it can be very challenging, can be very hectic depends which facility you working, you have to work hard and always try to keep up your number, I love to work there because you don’t have to talk to any one about a day off, you just use your phone are computer to put in your hours and go. Amazon job is always you have to dive deep."
good,"Its a great place for everybody, however, the Comp is not great. Total Comp is based on RSU and Income. "
good,"Leider war mein Vertrag nur befristet. Mir hat es aber gefallen, in den verschiedenen Abteilungen zu arbeiten."
good,Need Management more opportunities For employee  appreciation vision accountability mission statement a goal to look forward to more help that work not here paycheck dont just hire Spanish and black peoples hire all races need more management replacements shifts leads  appreciate your employees help employees with housing exciting for the employees health employee health employees housing
good,Good company but hours can get very hard for social life and work environment. Skills are good and the interview was good and challenged you very good
good,"I loved working here. A typical day on my job was moving carts, crash sorting, and sweeping. All of my managers were really nice and understanding. We also got a lot of VTO, so I was leaving every chance I got, but I would love to work there again."
good,If you want to work for Amazon be prepared to work and not stand about because you will not last long. When you start do not pack too fast start off slowly and build yourself up
good,"$15/hour for a relatively easy job. There are around 7 tasks someone can do, most of them are easy. A couple of them demand a bit of physical activity."
good,people where great to work with and it felt as if we where a family then coworkers. they also provided good hours for people who couldnt work the normal 8am-5pm
good,"Lots of growth opportunity,  friendly faces, safe place, support, they really look out for their employees. You get medical aid so when you apply for gym at virgin active you get 75% off. There's a canteen with healthy food.  There's free WiFi. There are little lounges to take naps during lounges."
good,"I love Amazon! If money wasn't an issue, I'd stay. It's easy and you meet all kinds of people there. The breaks are 15 min but if you want to walk away from your work station, that takes 5 min of that. You end up with about 9 minutes for each break and for a 10 hour shift,  you only get a 30 minute lunch. The money isn't enough to survive on if you have a family but the company is great to work for."
good,"Amazon has great benefits and decent pay. Can be tough on you physically. Fun coworkers. 4 days on. 3 days off. Paid holidays, PTO and vacation pay. There is room to grow here if you want. Best maternity benefits. Career choice pays 95% of schooling."
good,"You start with group stretches and then mgt tells you how many pkgs need to be sorted.  Your position will be listed on the roster which changes daily.  You're shift can be from 3 to 5 hours long. If 4 or more hours, you will get a 15 minute break."
good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo y un poco divertido llevan actuaciones el café es gratis y algunas veces también nos dan comida gratis como hamburguesas y pizzas y bollería se trabaja con mucho respeto en todos los sentidos ...
good,This is a decent place to work good pay good benefits great employees.its a little boring but it’s worth the money and the hours aren’t so bad plus U get plenty of time off.
good,"The culture at Amazon is one of the best I seen from any company, Definitely enjoyed the fast pace and challenging work that made you think of how to improve your day to day job."
good,"Excellent Company, Excellent Benefits, good opportunities and room to pursue all areas of interest in your career. It is tough to move up in the company without being willing to relocate."
good,Great company to work for looks after staff and Great atmosphere to work in.staff canteen is top quality bus services are provided from most areas and are very affordable which helps if you don't drive.
good,"Amazon is a pretty amazing job. You stay busy on your feet, it's like having a gym membership with added labor instead of just working the same desk job."
good,"Easily the best seasonal job I've had. I worked at DPX5 during the holiday season and it was pretty laid back for a job considering it was Amazon. It was fast-paced sometimes but never to the point where it was stressful, at least not to me. Most of it was scanning packages, sorting them, and then taking carts out to the yard for flex drivers to take, and then doing bags. You also could do overtime which was really nice. I had fun co-workers who made the experience a whole lot better. I got hired literally the day after they did the $15/hr thing so that was nice but they do let like 90% seasonal people go so that sucked. But it's a pretty cool job overall, would def do again!"
good,"Really enjoyed my time there, it was really the people I worked with that motivated me to keep working at this location. However,  I was not paid the amount I initially promised and hours."
good,"I would box, and load packages to other companies, I would short packages to the right companies that needed to be shipped too. Also I would lift 50+ pound boxes into bag to have them distribute to tucks that would send them off to the companies. I would also load trucks with their packages, unload trucks, separate the packages, redox packages, data entry, make graphs for the company and also train new employees. I would use a floor jack to move skids from one part of the wear house to the other, also move boxes from delivery trucks to the belts to be shorted to where they needed to go. ​"
good,"Just typical day. Scan for about 4 hours, and you are done. Learned how to be patient, and Just do what they ask. Time there goes by quickly do it was a easy paycheck every Friday."
good,Where I work at CLT5 promised our benefits after 90days I was there for seven months in good standing and never received my benefits and  I could not take advantage of other opportunities because of not having blue badge status.
good,"I have nothing but positive things to say about this company. There are great opportunities for advancing your career. Amazon does have a high turn-over, but thats because  many individual want to just play around and not work - its unbelievable."
good,"It is flexible, but yet competitive for routes. I am a Consumer Goods Specialist, but I would love to work at the corporate facility or in Ops. Anywhere I could get advancement would be great."
good,Work  connected by VPN. Fast paced virtual call center. Can be stressful. Calls and performance are based on metrics. Team support is high.Great resources for support. Flexible hours.
good,"Everything but outbound was amazing, well and boxes falling on you in inbound. So there's a specific way they teach you to work in outbound, and then there's the time that doesn't allow you to keep up working properly. People got upset because I could never keep up, while everyone else was making fill walls which are both a safety hazard for the driver, everyone on the road, and the unpackers in inbound."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Amazon Swansea. I was trained on different departments so it wasn't repetitive. The banter with colleagues was incredible and definitely made the time seem quicker. Free tea/coffee/soups were great and the pay was amazing, 4 days a week so had the weekend off which was good life work balance, friendly staff too. Sadly left because of family illness and then issues with transport on a Sunday but if I lived nearer now, I would go back in a heartbeat!"
good,I had the best experience as a PA at Amazon I was encouraged to grow my career throughout. it isn't for the light hearted it is long hours and a lot of hard work and passion but there was no one who was without passion as much as I was and Leadership Team and Directors - we did it together and I know I was appreciated in every effort all the way. I miss it :)
good,a typical day at work consisted of going from the first floor to the third floor on either side of the distribution center to locate consumer orders displayed on the RF scanner with a given time frame to locate said product i.e. blue ball in bin with abundance of other colored balls. The hardest part of the job was finding a problem solver when you couldn't find said product in the bin than bring it to there attention which took about 15-20  mins for them to get to you which cut into your production time. Most enjoyable part was my fellow coworkers in the morning during standup to get everyone motivated for the day ahead every work morning
good,"Fun place to work and plenty of people to make friends with. The hours are long but manageable. other associates are great to gain experience from. The targets are real tough but possible though it doesn't seem that way for your first week. Management seems to change a lot but the management overseeing us is great hes great but old school will push you to be the best you can be, good to have a chat with between picks and before/after work. Recommend the widnes fulfilment centre."
good,"Amazon isn't for everyone. We work hard,  play hard, and enjoy Teamwork.  Attendance, punctuality, responsibility, and a positive attitude are the keys to being successful in your role of putting smiles on customers faces. This is a customer centered culture. Without our customers we don't work. We work at a fast pace and slackers are frowned upon. Everyone is expected to be flexible and give 110% The rewards and benefits are dependent upon how much you put into your success"
good,"Amazon provided a great opportunity for me to express my leadership skills. Furthermore, their focus on customer satisfaction is excellent. As a Key Holder Associate, I've learned to delegate tasks, handle customer experiences -- good and bad -- and efficiently operate a location with high volume. In addition, the training I received to be up to speed with their continuous changing products and lineup was by far the best I've experienced."
good,It's not really hard job at Amazon. But working at night shift make out of balance for family. Most employees are fun and happy with pay and benefits.
good,"Amazing pay , amazing team members , some management was amazing , some was not "
good,I enjoyed working at amazon. the management team wasn't too good. I would have stayed with amazon but the work tracking system they had in place wasn't so well. it felt like no matter how hard I worked it still wasn't good enough. It also felt as though there was no way to advance in the company.
good,T hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 10 hours a day. You get 2 paid 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch. However you are scheduled for a ten and a half hour day so you actually work and get paid for ten full hours.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo compañerismo al máximo , malos horarios para llevar bien lo laboral con lo familiar"
good,Worked 7years 5 months I cried when I left had to relocate back to home town to help care for my parent. It’s 60 miles away or I would’ve loved to have stayed working there .
good,"I enjoyed working "
good,"I would remove all package off the assembly line and sort them to there designated shelves. Once placed on the shelf, I would sort the packages in the designated box for shipment."
good,Travaille parfait pour un jeune qui démarre dans le milieux professionnel
good,Have to be on time coming into work and breaks. Keep up with your equipment and badge to clock in and out. Time was not on your side. Quotas have to be met.
good,"The work environment is too stressful and there is so much pressure to meet up with the arbitrary rates. No job security, you can be fired anytime if you do not meet up."
good,Good management system.  There was no real opportunity for advancement unless willing to move.  I enjoyed driving a forklift while there.  Good work environment.  Christmas was a little overwhelming but 60 hours a week was good for the paycheck.
good,I just wished they had full benefits for their Seasonal workers and also honor our religious request asap. Overall though its the most relaxing easy good paying job.
good,Depends on what what manager you get and co workers you are around other than that you love it if you’re a morning or night person you have great time at work they throw party’s and have prizes
good,"A typical day would be office banter and lots of productive work completed before the deadlines."
good,Terrific place to work as a second job. For filling orders packing building customer loyalty fast paced great managers overall fun and satisfying work environment.
good,"Overall it was a good job environment.  Fast paced and demanding, but it can be rewarding as well. I hear they have raised their wages too.  So that could be good as well.  i would say that they had excellent benefits as well as stock options.  Plenty to rave about.  Go see for yourself."
good,"Absolutely loved my job, my team mates, and managers."
good,"I worked two different positions, picking and docks. Typically a picker walks 5-20 mi. per shift, keeping pace with the average items per minute. It was (or should be) fast-paced. Sometimes there were a number of people in the same area, during which times caution needed to be applied when going around corners. At other times I'd be able to work almost completely alone in the quieter corners of the facility, which was relaxing. On the docks, there were long periods of work, quick bursts of energy for moving products off of the trucks and onto the belt to be sent to a different part of the facility. There were short periods of breaks during which we could rest and get water. Typically there were 1-2 people working a single truck at a time. Conversation was allowed, and was usually fairly pleasant. The work could be tough sometimes, but rewarding."
good,Amazon would be a good job for anyone and everyone. As long as you can handle being on your feet and walking long distance for breaks. It alright. The only thing I would change is rates for all positions. I still dont understand that are productivity is based on how we do. Yet they base it off the building and everyone else.
good,"Amazon is a great company that I would love to advance and be a part of the largest company in the U.S.A.  Good leadership in a structured environment, with opportunities to advance.  However, I have become accustom to a much higher salary for my education and experience."
good,"In the time I work there I loved it, the people work hard and the place is well managed. There have plenty of extra incentives to boost your moral, for example team days out and hunt for amazon voucher days. but you had to fight for your overtime, which was first in first served."
good,"Highly Innovative, Forward-thinking and Customer-Centric. Pay for work and experience I provided wasn't competitive but allowed for unique experience working remote and for Amazon Logistics department. Seasonal/Contract-work."
good,"Good company but only on temporary basis "
good,"Z Amazonu mám mnoho zkušeností, které mě posunuly dál.Od základu jsem se posunula pro mě k nej práci.Úžasné jsou i motivační akce."
good,Great company to work with as it follows very great culture and respect towards its employees. It also allows us to work from home a day in a week. Provides good work environment.
good,I worked in a fast paced environment which involved in keeping up with targets and heavy lifting also keeping within the health and safety guidelines.
good,"my job and regular work day consisted of unloading trucks and packages"
good,"All in all good people and fun place to work at."
good,"I liked it. Fast paced. Competitive. Diverse. Positive leadership. Great benefits. If you are lazy ato all, don't even try to work there. You don't belong. You will sandbag the group."
good,"You stay moving the entire shift and have to move heavy items but they pay you decently and give you your benefits in about a week, not 90 days. If you know what you're in for then its a decent job."
good,"I’ve experienced exceptional and lackluster leadership, in 3 full turnover cycles, writhing 20 months. Amazon as a company does invest in its associates and managers. The culture shift at the building level, can be interpreted differently."
good,"One of the greatest companies in the world. Focused on Kaizan quality improvement projects and developing workforce. Competitive contests reward hard work."
good,"The work is fun and challenging having to meet certain targets everyday, the days go quick because the work is exciting and the people are also kind and are always open to questions and to giving advice"
good,My days at work were typical. I worked hard on my line.  I tried to get everyone to keep up on  the line. Management was  fine. The work culture was fun.
good,"There're so many brilliant colleagues to work with, and you can always develop yourself here at Amazon. Only down part is the oncall I think. But this varies in different teams."
good,Seh gutes arbeiten mit sehr guten leuten und guten Mitarbeiter umgang
good,I would recommend only if you are hard working person. Hard work because you must maintain your rate and if your rate goes down then you receive write up and possible termination if you continue to do so.
good,"typical work day consists of labor staffing decisions, engaging with associates and driving work in order to product maximum production results as well as the highest level of quality and safety."
good,"I worked at Amazon twice over the past two years as temporary.  It was face paced, long hours and good pay.  It was fun for me as I like to stay active and have no problem meeting quotas."
good,good company with lots of opportunities. but need permanent jobs instead of contract jobs. otherwise its a good company nothing to complain wonderful company and culture
good,"fun productive fast based , diverse community with different back grounds sometimes makes it hard to find a common subject but friendly atmosphere in general"
good,"Amazon is a good place for a college grad to start their career. A good day at work was when we used to get all the Amazon goodies and devices handed over."
good,It was a great experience for me working as Transaction Risk Investigator. The team worked together in order to define the legitimacy of the customer and to protect the organisation and customers account from fraudulent activities. The company has a fun work culture with supportive colleagues and experienced seniors.
good,"Amazon is really a great company. The company rewards excellency in productivity, quality and safety. You can also move up the ranks internally. The benefits offered by the organization is equally very good."
good,"One of the best companies that i've worked. Love the work culture, atmosphere, environment, fun loving people to work with. Gained a vast knowledge of many things and also improved my standards and skills. Enjoy the deadlines, targets to achieve, the best get rewarded."
good,"laid back"
good,"Cool job! Arrives to warehouse, find route, get a van to drive, find van, load van with over 150+ packages, follow GPS to deliver packages. Easy. The hardest part about driving is other people on the road and icy sidewalks. "
good,"It was good work place with good people, energy flow and easy pay. Management was good, very productive for the most part, sometimes slow, but overall a good experience."
good,"Everyone is pleasant and helpful. You can ask a question to anyone wearing a vest and get and answer or a follow up of the answer is not known at the moment. Every shift begins with music and stretching as a team, followed by announcements and a rally up for sort time!!!...just positive everywhere!!!"
good,"Amazon is one of the only places I've ever worked where taking breaks throughout the day to do group stretches was mandatory... and it's a good thing, because you're doing a lot of repetitive motions that can cause physical injury if you don't stretch out.  They have a culture of ""Stay in shape so you can keep up!"".  It's a real teamwork vibe, like you're playing a sport together, with healthy competition and pushing through. It's fast-paced, so the day flies by."
good,Would i Recommend working at amazon. Yes I would. The starting pay was 16 an hour which in my location was more than enough to live off of. Also they dont mind you working OT at all. Lots of money to be mad
good,Its was a great Job for me during my time of in college but being this is not great for the long run. But I wanted to find something else beside package handling.
good,Great place to work but bad management. Very bad at communication skills. HR is very slow at responding to emails. Really no room for advancement and no matter position basically get the same pay
good,"Good but temporay, very physical and exhausting for older people, good for young, first job, extra income for just a temporary. Not given medical at alll"
good,"It was a great and easy job not very heard , just a lot of sitting in one spot for a long period of time. You will also have very short breaks but on for the most part it’s very easy."
good,"amazon ist ein hochinnovatives, extrem schnelles auf Kundennutzen ausgerichtetes Technologieunternehmen, das täglich den Status Quo in Frage stellt und neue Lösungen generiert, die Bedarfe auf Kundenseite schaffen, wo bisher kein Bedarf existiert hat."
good,Amazon is a good place to start especially with optional work schedule that fit your timing . It put you on your toes.  Not a place for lazy folks. Good Management and great benefits
good,"I liked doing my job, due to it being fast paced. The only thing that I did not like was that I did not feel like the company itself tried hard enough to help me keep employment."
good,Great place to work. Easy and fast paced environment doing different jobs everyday. You start off with a group meeting and then assignments are given out.
good,"Good company, place to work is nice with games and other things you can use to spend your break time, wifi connection if you want to check anything online and play games as well."
good,"The job was a good experience for me, I would take a opportunity to go back but I’m looking for something with more benefits and better values to me while duing the duty."
good,it has nice working place and it is fast pace and mice people with work with and good benefits and paid time which is good and they help student  to pay fees.
good,good and organzied infrastructure as well as safety the people their work hard and are as safe as they can be for good work and a safe enviorment.....
good,"Amazon is a really really great place to work. It's every day as day 1 at Amazon. Get to learn new things every day. "
good,amazon is a grate job to have the people are nice and it is a pretty easy job to get the hang of the one bad thing i have about it is the temp serves is stooped if you can get past them your job is golden.
good,It’s fast paced. It’s not hard to get fired so make sure you check with your managers about errors and quality. Overall it’s been a great experience. It’s 2 15min breaks that are paid and 1 30min lunch break that’s nonpaid.
good,"Moto of amazon"
good,"I like the pre shift gathering... I call it ""the huddle"". Good information passed along. Pick out scanners and get to work. I have a definite feeling of accomplishment at the end of the shift. Work culture is very focused on getting the job done. Probably why, this location is number one in performance."
good,"Amazon is a good company to work for.  There are some good managers that actually care about the individual employees, while  others are a bit more disciplined, and ensure that all rules regulations, and safety practices are followed."
good,"Amazon.com offers a place to work with a full-time schedule, benefits and a livable wage. The job is fast paced. This company is also growing all the time."
good,"I love my job so far. Its rewarding, pay is great, and the pay is really nice too (overtime bonuses during peak seasons). What i like most about the position is that its a very diverse group of people with a goal to meet. I work as a delivery associate and i must say, the job is totally awesome."
good,"Overall it’s an easy place to work at(I work at the returns warehouse.) the times are just exhausting I wish this warehouse offered part time but they don’t, every other facility does tho"
good,"Very good environment, great benefits, would recommend, I would still be working there if the hours had been what I was interested in at the time, they are open to working with your schedule though"
good,I put away the merchandise. I pick orders for the customers so they could be shipped out . They use to provide transportation to and from work and you got alot of overtime
good,"Shifts at Amazon range from 10 hrs - 12 hrs a day. Best job if you are looking for something stable. Your shift never changes, your always on break at the scheduled time, and you don't have to work more than 4 days a week. You are afforded unpaid time-off which you can use for emergencies during the work week, a negative balance of these hours can result in termination, though. Paid time-off and vacation time accumulate as you work. Benefits are excellent, unbeatable, and you can sign up as soon as you are hired!"
good,"Very competitive environment, Excellent Pay structure, no work life balance, too much fast pace, excellent growth opportunities, great learning opportunities."
good,"Working in Amazon India is one of the awesome thing. Despite the work pressure, the life at workstaton is cool with techie environment."
good,"to sit in solemn silence on a dull dark dock in a pestilential prison with a life long lock, awaiting the sensation of a short sharp shock by a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block"
good,Amazon development center is a place where you can work with a relaxed mind and achieve your career goals.You can get help from your superiors and peers when you are having some trouble at work.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, I just do not like competing for shifts. Other than that pay is great and the managers are really helpful. It is not a stressful work environment."
good,"Relatively a good place to work but one has to concentrate and be very much accurate and fast  in executing your responsibilities especially  working amongst younger  indivuals. i did enjoyed my stay,"
good,Before working there is always a meeting with the staff members and were all stretching since the shifts are long and we are on our feet the whole time staying busy.
good,Long and something to get use to. I learned that you have to work hard. Its very big and cold and not much excitement. The hardest part of the job is working 10 hour shifts or longer.
good,"I have worked in an office for more than 10 years, I applied with Amazon thinking I would be able to move to an office position. I am having a hard time just getting an interviee. There are so many applying for the same positions."
good,Amazon is a good place for single moms or people who need certain times of the day off. It's very fast paced though. If your not used to moving and keep moving for 4-5 hours constantly it may be tough. But you can adjust.
good,Very fast very exciting I thought working at this place was pretty cool the management and the time off was alright I didn’t mind it T all I hope to work here again
good,"Amazon was a great place to work, I was lucky enough to get into facilities, where you can advance and keep making more money, unlike inbound and outbound workers who top out. The only downfall of my job was that they kept promising that I could advance. I never did. The pay was okay, but when it comes down to your reviews and your waiting and hoping for that 1 big pay raise, It falls flat. I think in my eight years there, the biggest raise i got was .20 cents per hr. even with the miniscule raises, i was still making 20$ per hr.  The fellow associates I had were  great. Amazon is big on not bulling others, and big on no sexual harassment.  overall it was one of the best jobs i have had."
good,I worked for Amazon as a summer job. it was a great experience and I learned a lot about great teamwork and making good goals to reach my full potential. They were very conscious about safety and made sure we all knew how to do our jobs the best that we could. however getting a job feels very impersonal and if you call hr you get a call center that has written scripts to help you. so could have been better at that aspect.
good,"Solid career option. I like working for the company overall, it has its pros and cons as every company does. I’m just looking to progress to management now and not wait."
good,"I had wonderful colleagues and Managers including team leaders that were really sporting and helpful. "
good,"It's a great place to work part-time. There's always something to do inside the warehouse. It's never a dull place to work. It's also a great place to meet people. Initiative and independent thinking is always encouraged. There can be really busy days, especially during the holidays. It's fun to work here."
good,I love a different job everyday. Quiet and enjoyable blocks yet sometimes it can get aggravating. Love the group on FB as it gives you feedback on questions you may have.
good,"used rf scanner to scan boxes to ensure correct destination, on time everytime. codes numerical, fast paced,on move versus stanting in one place at any given time."
good,Most of the people are very driven. They come into work ready to rank high scores and get work stocked quickly. Others may need some help or just want to work at a slower pace.
good,It always started with an encouraging meeting and stretching to limber us up for the day. I was able to see new different products and learned how to use a hand held RF scanner. I also learned how to understand customer orders as they came in on my scanner. Management was great if I ever had any questions or problems they were always near by to help. It was a very lenient job but strict at the same time. They allowed you to have fun as long as you stayed on task. One of the more difficult things about the job was sometimes keeping up with the quota depending on the size of the items we had to stow or put on the shelf. I loved the fact that they did allow us to interact with the fellow employees and talk while working as long as we didn't have errors or warnings on our file.
good,"I love working for Amazon. They offer great benefits and a lot of extras the longer you work there. For example, each employee starts with shares, after 2 years you are able to cash them in, or roll them over. For tier 1 & 3 positions you are also able to get a monthly bonus for showing up for work and not using any UPT (unpaid time off) , Many people have commented about the long hours on your feet there. They do expect you to work and make your performance. Both are completely reasonable. They also offer paid holidays and are closed for major holidays. I am also currently enrolled back in school and it was paid for by amazon ($3000 per yr up to 4 yrs) "
good,It was fun to see a lot of different items. It got very repetitive and boring after seeing the same things over and over. Not the place to work for a very long time of you like change.
good,"Amazon is fast paced team based job that cares about . They have great benefits, and opportunity to grow. This is a very diverse company that allows its employees to be themselves and achieve success as a whole"
good,"I genuinely loved working at Amazon. If circumstances were different I would have chosen to remain there. Its also the hardest I have ever worked. All of your learning will be on the job. There is no real ""training"". A fact that was drilled home in orientation when every speaker highlighted the lack of training and reference resources. If your manager wants you to succeed they will clue you into what tools you will need and how to work within Amazon's many undocumented workflows and SOPs.  If they don't you may find it challenging to thrive."
good,"I worked at the robotics FC in San Bernardino for a year before I relocated to another state which the area I live in now is much too far from the nearest Amazon FC. I would otherwise love to transfer to another Amazon FC. Working at an Amazon FC can be stressful at times and they expect a lot from you because it is a customer obsessed company. It is also not for everyone. I do feel the associates should be paid more because of the goals the company expect you to make each day. The benefits are great I only paid $80ish for medical, dental and vision for myself and 3 children. You also can opt in on 401K and you have stock opt. in which after 2yrs of working with the company you can buy more or you can sell."
good,worked there 3 years and had the best and worst times but that comes with any job. i was able to wear comfortable but dress code clothes. stay to yourself because theres alot of drama and gossip with the employees.
good,My Rating is overall Good. Das Firmenumfeld ist sehr gut. Alle Kollegen sind freundlicher
good,"You'll be repeating the same thing for 10 hours a day minimum 4 days a week. The hours are long, but you get paid breaks that last ~10 minutes then you're off to do the same thing for 3 hours. It's definitely not for someone with a social life because this job will eat it up and will steal your youth. With that said, there are some benefits like your voice in the warehouse actually means something and will be taken into consideration unlike other warehouses. One thing going into this job is that you are easily replaceable and they will not bat an eye if you threaten to quit or resign. You'll see one person leave and 3 more come the next day. None of the work is hard but the long, repeating hours is what makes people lose it. All in all, if you're willing to put in the work, have a strict sleeping schedule ( I mean literally waking up, work, go home to sleep and repeat ) , and good discipline, you could make it."
good,"It was easy to come into work and enjoy it and not feel down about it. It was a great experience to have and i would recommend anyone to give it a shot, It has alot of opportunity with in the job itself.."
good,"I made a decision to leave my full time job to go to part time with Amazon. The whole process with Amazon was quick. I started off seasonal, I made my monthly goal in the timeframe, I was able to convert to blue badge (permanent). After being blue badge for 30 days, I was told I can apply to transfer to full time. I did it without knowing what I was getting into. Right now my current job position is stower. Basically that means I bought items that is being brought into the facility into pods. It is a cutthroat environment, you arent allowed to take a bunch of breaks which makes sense. They allow you to go to the bathroom but not 10 times a day. You arent allowed to have you phone with you on the floor. You are allowed to bring drinks and food onto the floor. I absolutely love Amazon, of course it gets stressful at times but what job doesnt. Pay is decent they start you off at 12 an hr."
good,"I really loved working for Amazon, the energy of the people was great, everyone was always pushing each other to find the best solutions and learn the most to have the greatest impact. The only reason I left was it was easier to find promotions outside of the companies than within."
good,"Overall a great company to work for. Just need management evaluated. The culture behind Amazon is something that helps me stick around. Yet, the way they push you to make rates, and have no understanding of barriers is ridiculous. If you excel in a job, you best believe you’ll forever be in that role. The “standard” doesn’t require them to rotate you. Be prepared for a lot of work... and be prepared for sometimes no work at all."
good,"They selectively enforce policy. I was a learning coordinator, and I was terminated for safety violations which others also committed ( have the documented proof), yet they got promotions."
good,"good positive working environment, fixed shifts, and good career progression and chance to be took on full time. Some areas within the warehouse are better as packing is a lot better than stowing."
good,"Amazon is a place of work where you are constantly working & doing something. You should never not be standing around doing nothing, unless you are going to the restroom. Amazon is like a beehive because there is constant noise and people always moving to get their place of work done."
good,fun work place that you can really meet some cool people and develope lasting relationships at.always some kind of network wide events going on and i like that amazon gives back
good,Amazon is a wonderful place to work towards your future within the Customer Service industry. There is plenty of opportunities within the company and growth.
good,Good good good good I’ll do it again if the opportunity comes to me was fun fast paced environment and very organized except for inbound unloading times
good,I loved working for Amazon. You were given pay and non pay hours you could to excuse absences and they would increase over a period of time. If you don't use your hours they would either role over next year or you would get pay for them. Some hours you had to use or you would loose them.
good,"PersI don’t work many hours a week , but I do enjoy the job and the perks."
good,"Amazing company, shifts interrupt your life after a bit but overall it is an amazing company with a great support system with a genuine love and appreciation for staff"
good,"amazon has a great work cutlure.. work is challenging. "
good,"great benefits, fun place to work, good work hours.  its hard to promote unless you have someone in management that wants you to move up regardless of your skill set."
good,"It's a nice temporary job if you're looking for some extra cash. Flexible hours. You work 3 days on and 4 days off one week and 4 days on, 3 days off the next week. Shifts for full time were 12 hours a day...pretty doable with the 3-4 days off you get. Great for younger people who are quick paced and able to keep up their pick rate. Not the best for older people who have trouble moving around fast and bending, stretching, and reaching for items. Job security is good if you can keep up your pick rate."
good,"An ok place to work.  0 tolerence don't be late..you will get fired..everything is by phone..you talk to automated machines when you cant come in,running late etc..  If you can't keep up with a fast paced JOB...DON'T APPLY"
good,"Un'azienda Top deve avere anche dipendenti che stanno al Top. Amazon questo l'ha capito. Ambiente di lavoro curatissimo. Scrivanie, sedie, bagni cucine in condizioni impeccabili. Paga puntuale."
good,"Great part time job for delivering parcels around Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire areas. Good management, I have learned to be quick in delivering parcels. The hardest part of this job is when delivery location and navigation is not accurate according to the app standards.The most enjoyable part of this job is able to meet different kind of people from different areas."
good,"a good place to work, so is pay but you have to be willing to give up a  lot of time to it and and you have to be ready stand all day. other then that it a really great place."
good,"mgmt. constantly shifts around.  they young people fresh out of college that need experience, always feel like you are training mgmt.  employees are helpful, and courteous."
good,"Great work environment. once you have been there for 1 full year, they give you the opportunity to take on-site classes to better your career. I love it."
good,"2 horaires (matin et après-midi)"
good,"i enjoyed working here.it wasn't to stressful i only left because the hours ended up interfering with current job. it was a good job with good pay, and good people."
good,It was fast paced using database.  Suitable for me at the time. Learned about retail business. Hardest part was being looking at the computer screen for so long.
good,"I loved working for Amazon, but hated working night shift. It was difficult to switch to day shift. The pay and benefits were good, but felt like it should be paid more for the kind of work that was being done."
good,I like working for amazon great pay.I would work for them again if they could work with my family schedule.I have three children and it was hard trying to balance work with amazon and my children.
good,Great for part time work.  You choose your own schedule based on the three different shifts available.  The site is open seven days a week and hours of operation are 6:30am to 9:30pm.
good,you need to be outgoing to meet other workers it can be a little tedious some times when the day is slow but they do give you vto so you can leave early if need be
good,Recieved and full filled the products to customers in timely manner. Customer first works for the most part EXCEPT when they are in the wrong. Amazon needs to support their sellers on a case by case situation.
good,"Unfortunately - since I was a great employee. I chose to participate in the by out of cash for my years of service and they say that I will never be allowed to work for them again."
good,"A typical day would be on hand/foot.  Scanning, sorting, building pallets, wrapping, closing and moving pallets, staging, gate keeping, problem solving, taking safety measures, interacting and communicating with coworkers for smooth running of operations, etc."
good,"Each day of Amazon is a new day. There are many different options of what you do on a daily basis. I have been trained in Customer Returns, PIT operator, Water Spidering, Non-con, and inbound."
good,"The job and the people I worked with were nice enough, I just didn't quite appreciate how harshly they pushed their rates on you as well over 50% of the employers couldn't keep up with the rates, get fired and come back 2 or 3 months later after their wait period for rehire is up and try again. Their rates are too high in most facilities."
good,"Very busy, fast paced, tiresome.  Always walking or standing in one spot.  Always moving.  It's a hard job for the pay.  No room for financial growth."
good,"As an outbound pick department in a fulfillment center in two different locations I was very happy to have the opportunity to work for an amazing organization. I am sad not working there now. The hours were not fitting as I worked Thurs-Sat. nights and had a second job during the day. I was a PA and did not have the flexibility to move to other shifts since PA positions were not available. Thus, was the reason for my leaving (not enough sleep)."
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you have the stamina to be in foot for 10 plus hours and work fast pace at the same time. You have to be able to withstand working in hot temperatures as well. All while doing so you also have to make a rate of at least 320 items picked per hour.
good,Pay not great but good place to work for.  Work schedule is very flexible.  Pay is set at $10 an hour with no raises.  Management is laid back and friendly.
good,C'est un environnement très agréable où l'on peut évoluer rapidement.
good,My time at Amazon allowed me to supplement my income with great evening hours. The hours were great and you can get extra hours if available. They provide additional training so that you can add duties to the position and eventually be promoted or apply for positions within.
good,It's a Lovely place to work with decent opportunities provided you are prepared to work hard and be social. I would recommend taking the opportunity to work in new departments
good,its a really fast pace environment. that provides fun activities during peak which is the busiest time of the year. The most enjoyable part the people everyone is generally outgoing and fun to be around.
good,Overall good company to work for. Management have a very laid back approach including dress code. High focus on health and safety. Good benefits and good shift patterns
good,"I enjoyed my time with amazon ."
good,"I learned that even in the end, its all about yourself. Rate and time off task will get you randomly but in over all its a great place to work at if you don't mind 10-11 hours of working with ""15"" minute breaks"
good,they do have temporary benefits and i love steady  if you  dot like to work that's not your place to be.. the do fire people for there tot(Time Off Task so keep working the only reason i changed because another job opportunity
good,"The culture at Amazon is awesome, plenty of benefits, but hours are long and the work is the same thing everyday which can become extremely boring and make the time pass slow. Managers are pretty understanding and everyone is extremely friendly. You get to have awesome holiday parties during the summer and winter."
good,If u are willing to work long hard hours at a fast pace environment this job is for you lots of people at a fast pace loving management very good pay and guaranteed hours
good,Everyday was a fresh start at amazon i just could not keep up with the full time over night and full time schooling. At Amazon I learned about robotics and safety dealing with the machines. The hardest part about the job  is time management you get 30 minutes for break but if you are in the back it takes 15 minutes to get to the break room.
good,Un poco de racismo de parte de algunos manager al personal latino
good,"I was testing in a seasonal role advertising on iPads, iPhones, Fire Phones, Kindles, Windows phones and other related devices. We had to be sure that the ads worked, clicked through to products and that they were of proper aspect ratio and if they had video or other features, that content had to work. "
good,"This is company that truly has an environment for you to freely be yourself. As a member of the LGBT community, this is very important.  This company has ample amount of restrooms and break rooms to eat. They also have places for you to purchase your lunch as well as store your brought lunch."
good,Amazon the company is a good place to work for but management do have their picks and chooses. They let go of the people that work hard and keep the ones that don't do nothing
good,"Not an awful job. Depending on the volume for the day. You work is 3-5 hours. You can get up to six shifts a week, which I did. 6 shifts within 4 days, had three days off. I would have 25-30 a week. 30 hours is the limit, of course since it's part-time job. During peak you can get up to 60 hours. This job is good for anyone who is in college or just want a little extra money. I would not recommended  this job for someone who has to support a family unless you need extra income. $11.50 is not bad. I rather work for that than $8.50 at McDonald where they over work you. If you're retired or have disabilities, great place for you. They hire anyone. The work is not hard, you get paid reasonably. Most of the management is great. They will help you if you ask. Just stay on their good side."
good,Managers try their best to instill on Associates the Amazon standards and guidelines needed to succeed in the Fulfillment Center environment.  Managers will go to great lengths to make sure everyone succeeds.  This is provided through training and more training with the idea that Associates will eventually get the correct standards to succeed in the job.  All this while making the workplace environment fun to be in.
good,"My overall experience was not bad. The hours were never a issue.  Your body has to adjust to the requirements of the job. The culture is of the job is not bad at all. The job can definitely be challenging, but you have got to be up for it  in order to make it."
good,"I truly love amazon, however management is not the best I would love to grow with the company I just cannot work as a packer for the rest of my life. My  Goal is to become a paramedic and hopefully work in am care at Amazon"
good,Even though my time at Amazon was limited I genuinely did enjoy my time working for Amazon. The attention to detail in the work environment was my favorite part of being part f their team.
good,"The workplace is fun, friendly, and informal. This company is open 24/7 therefore you should expect to work day or night shift. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, and the most enjoyable part is the salary, and benefits that come with the job. There is also a lot of growth within the company, so working your way up should not be a problem"
good,"Tuve muy buena experiencia el tiempo q estuve allí,se trabaja muchísimo pero hay muy buen ambiente,en el tiempo de descanso tienen todo muy bien preparado tanto para quien se lleva su almuerzo como si lo quieres comprar q x cierto allí es super barato pero como en todo tiene su lado malo,t contratan x trabajo temporal y es muy difícil quedarte x empresa sólo se quedan los enchufados como en todas partes"
good,This was a good place to work at. I got the chance to expand my leadership skills. The job was very demanding but rewarding at the same time. There is room to expand and grow in the company.
good,"its exactly what you apply for. very easy and repetitive. while I was there i learned a lot, such as how to use their ict systems, gained a lot of communication skills and team leadership. and meeting goals"
good,I was recruited by Pmp recruitment agency in the run-up to Xmas travelling took 45 minutes but amazon put on a bus which picked me up local cost £8 return which is nothing considering the wages my shift started at 7pm till 5.30am lots of overtime as well although you were told halfway through the night last minute the staff were great treated me like part of the team even the management were great to get on with always someone at hand to help if you had a problem home cooked meals from the canteen were brilliant £2.60 for a 2 course meal the vending machines were free fun and games every night with a chance to win prizes I would go back and work at amazon at every opportunity I get
good,"This is my first experience in a warehouse environment.  I have fallen in love. I love that I am moving and lifting constantly.  I love there are so many different people and we all know our job and perform very smoothly,"
good,Fast paced work environment. Long work hours that do provide alot of hours weekly. Great management and fun hard working co workers that assist in the needs of each other.
good,"A lot of hypocritical actions to overcome, like worn out equipment that doesn't work properly and causes you to move slowly. This counts against your ""pack time""."
good,The atmosphere is amazing and the people you work with are friendly. The huddle is the morning is helps get you prepped for what you are going to encounter.
good,You gain first hand experience being a salesperson kind of like being a stock market speculator because your thinking which product you list will sell more.
good,"Giveaways happen often with $500 values or less.  Free lunches, snacks are also frequent.  Poor management and training.  Lots of opportunity for advancement."
good,Ambiente molto stimolante con possibilità di crescita
good,"great from beginning to the end. Great management. The times for work was a bit fuzzy but over all cool. Breaks were good timing, if i needed time to request off it was good."
good,"If you want to lose weight, this is the place to be. Most people keep to themselves. Everyone walking in looked like Zombies about to devour a delicious meal."
good,Think fast bring water hard on backs and feet. Security is tight. No cell phones on the floor allowed. You get a very small locker. Its hot in the summer. Cold in winter.
good,"Worked Peak 2017 (November 2017 - January 2018) at ONT6. Was employed as a picker; training was acceptable. I found it to be a pleasant place to work - by and large the staff and other employees minded their P's & Q's, and the number of slackers was minimal. Management was mostly recent college grads, with floor staff going from just legal work age to courting retirement. Tends to be a very ""by the book"" environment; expectations are clearly laid out and infractions are dealt with promptly. It's physically challenging to be sure - I wore a pedometer for one shift and clocked 11.15 miles for 10 hours. Most enjoyable was to be able to help out during their Christmas rush and make a few bucks doing so, and learned ho immensely important attitude is as a line supervisor. One or two of the supervisors really need to work on their presentation skills, but for the most part they did a very good job."
good,"Hardest part of the job is being satisfied by your best effort, in short, self-recognition."
good,"provides free meals and also allow the workers to play games tabletennis , table soccer etc. very friendly staff. provides overtimes."
good,"Excellent opportunity for growth. Pay was reasonable. 10 hour shifts but once you get used to it they are easy. Great team environment, most everyone works well together to accomplish set goals."
good,Good environment and nice place to work just the hours wasn’t working for me because I was a full time student so I couldn’t really make my shift but they do give a lot of hours and pay good I would defiantly recommend this job
good,Loved working for Amazon. As long as you do your part its a great place for advancement. The more hours you work the more paid-time off you earn. Great benefits especially for families.
good,"having worked both on the floor and in IT, I can say that the biggest challenge of working at Amazon is the high expectations of its employees; but the best part about working at amazon is the camaraderie and job security. "
good,"Excellent place to work with many facilities like gym, ping pong that help you relax amidst your work. Which when we are back helps concentrate more and be very creative and innovative at work."
good,"Es un ambiente relajado en cuanto a la expresión de sus agentes, no importa cómo te vistas  o cómo te peines siempre que realices tu trabajo de manera adecuada."
good,"Temporary seasonal position great company great benefits ... Busy fast pace , full time work schedule .. great company to work for. Guaranteed hours, overtime also available."
good,"Had to be logged into their system 10 minutes ahead of time and all windows ready to roll before taking a call. Once the calls rolled in, you needed to be prepared for whatever the customer had to throw out at you. Could be something simple as a login issue or as hard as dealing with a vendor who would not refund or accept a return. Since we are dealing with clients via phone they did not hold back in their verbiage or how you were treated unless they got what they wanted. Which we always did our absolute best to make that happen."
good,"Amazon is fast-paced as you are constantly busy.  The only down-side is concrete flooring which can be hard on the body.  If you are willing to work, it is a great job with good benefits"
good,"Working at Amazon I am constantly moving and when you give 100% you can reach your goals and the goals of the company."
good,"Worked Wednesday to Saturday"
good,Not a bad place to work. Fast paced environment.  The work is not hard though it is repetitive. Has great insurance benefits and shares of stock starting from day one with vesting after 2 years of employment.
good,Human resources have terrible attitudes and acts as if they hate their jobs. They don't fix things on time and there is always an issue with your pay or your check and your hours. Its horrible.
good,Exhausting but fun work. Peak has it's rewards for exceeding production limits. Diverse culture with an abundance of nice people. However youth is favored for promotions. There are issues with favoritism but if you enjoy the job it is easy to overlook. Pay is better than other warehouses in the area and PTO/VTO makes it a better culture than the competitors in the area. You are in control of your income.
good,"Amazon provides and promotes a friendly culture since the very beginning of becoming an employee until the very end of quitting the company, the problem can be a few bad apples."
good,"Excellent pay, and benefit, but they work you to death, and they have their favorites...The hours are long and you stand up for 10 hours or more., But you meet so great people"
good,"as long as you have a degree you will go far, but if you haven't it's hard work getting management to getting you to the next level, you can learn lots."
good,I enjoy working for Amazon.  There is always something productive to do.  All of the people I work with and work for are nice and management is great.
good,"Hard to get hired now. The process is easy but you have to be available at every shift time now if you want a chance because they have a lot of people who apply. Even then if could take them months to hire you. It is group oriented but you can work by yourself if you want. Upbeat (sometimes a little too much) atmosphere. Good pay for the work. Consistent hours, occasionally you can take extra shifts. VERY structured with everything."
good,"This isn't a job for the older ones.  You have days in packing where you're packing microwaves, tools, unassembled bookcases and bed platforms.  If your count isn't high enough you will end up terminated."
good,"Training was easy. Two weeks on computers learning the system and policies. Then two weeks of training on the phones. Management was great. Communication is open and available. This position requires a lot of independence because you work from home. Management and team members are always available and willing to help, but a lot of information can be found on your own. They are very generous by rewarding employees with gift cards and provide good feedback. Call volume can get high, but it makes the work day go faster. Some shifts are long and require 12 hours of time set aside to work for a 10 hour shift with breaks factored in. Pay could be a little higher, but OT is offered during peak hours. Benefits for full time. None for seasonal."
good,"I work as a Seasonal employee right now time not to exceed 4-11 months. They could convert you  over to part-time regular in the that time of you do a good job.  Some of the people they have there in LEADERSHIP POSITION THAT MAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AS YOU OR A $1.00 MORE!! Want to talk to you crazy but once you set them straight they are alright. The job is not hard at  all they want you get a certain percentage everyday 145 for senior  employee and  new ones scan rate of 130. Every shift has a different scan rate they much achieve. They offer incentives if you pick up extra shift during peak. They gave us dinner for the 1st year anniversary, and snacks sometimes. For a part-time job its alright and good for the younger generation but some older adults are there to."
good,"Pickers walk up to 15 miles every shift. There are no elevators. People who have been there for years can make rate easily. Pickers have to make rate regardless of being sick, in pain or a bad route. A picker may be moved around from area to area multiple times throughout a shift. Management will try to work with you. The best part is meeting new people."
good,"Amazon is an excellent place to work. The Management Team, HR Team are awesome people that will help you in any way to improve your job, making it better for the people, listen to daily issues and resolve within a reasonable time frame. The GM is active with employees working at SDF1 and always has an upbeat personality to encourage the employees to be successful within Amazon."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the people and I also like the fact that there is always something to do and is fast paced. Management is very helpful and I would recommend working here, especially in the summer."
good,"amazon is the bigest online suplier across uk delivering a large range of products ordered online by the cusomers starting from food ,electronics ,grocerie products and many others."
good,"Good company to work with, the employees have good support from the management and the work culture is very good stress free. Recently there has been many changes and the satisfaction level has come down now."
good,"mucho trabajo pero fenomenal , se pasa el dia muy rapido. El manejo de pistola de radiofrecuencia distinta a donde estuve trabajando anteriormente.La direccion pendiente de que no nos falte de nada.Cultura  de que la empresa suba cada dia mas.El andar tanto con las botas de seguridad.Lo que mas me gusto es el magnifico ambiente de trabajo y si te hacia falta salir antes por algo no ponian impedimento ninguno."
good,"I was a freelance stylist. Therefore, I only worked whenever they needed the extra hands. On average, I was booked roughly 1-2 times a week. It was fast-paced & you needed to have the talent & skills to continue getting booked."
good,"great company to work. Growth opportunities are high. i definitely recommend my friends to work here. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazons warehouse MDT1"
good,"amazon is a very cool place to work it's the management that hard to deal with. they don't go by seniority when it comes to advancement they go by favortism and that's totally unfair to the employees. management needs to communicate better with their employees, it makes it very discouraging to work there."
good,"Great people to work with, fun and productive. people would get along. There was favoritism but they gave people opportunities when they would ask. they're fair in that type of way."
good,"Some days everything runs very smooth and then other days something has changed. At times not enough consistency. "
good,Amazon is a great place to work. If I didn't have pregnancy issues I would have still been working there.The work is hard but is defenitly worth the check .
good,Get hired full time and receive excellent benefits. This company is rapidly growing and there is room to reap those benefits and then some to enjoy time off with family.
good,Nice and fun loving . Good management and security. Learning is more and experience is also gained from the leads so work hard have fun and make history
good,"Must be prepared to walk many miles during a shift, enormous warehouse over several floors, training given over 1 full day with varying shifts, all tote work is delivered via conveyor."
good,"Bonne expérience pour débuter dans le monde du travail. Travail non difficile et très intéressant, polyvalence assuré et bonne ambiance de travail."
good,"It's hard but good pay good benefits and awesome staff"
good,Amazon is and awesome company to work for.  They make your job very pleasant.  the Coworkers make it so fun to work with.  They are their for you and help you learn the job efficiently.
good,"This is one of the only jobs where I live that allows you to work for a nationally recognized company. "
good,"I love my job, because of the people I work with.  Not everyone is like this, so I tend to distance myself.  I have a positive attitude and try to stay away from drama. They have pajama day, crazy sock day, management tries to keep it interesting and fun. They have drawing and prizes, good prizes all during the year.,"
good,"Good Work Culture"
good,"Overall its an okay place to work. The break time isn't long & they make sure you go back to work at the end of it. The hardest part of it is, reaching the scan rate per hour."
good,"I worked in a pretty easy department very laid back no hard work to do. Managers tend to get switched in and out constantly, I went through 3 manager in 3 months kinda sucks. The benefits are really good in my opinion although if youre not on track you might get stuck in a tier 1 position the whole time."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that we come in and they play music at the beginning of each shift and after lunch. The coworkers are great too.
good,Compensation is good and benefits are awesome. There is room to balance work and social life. Employee need to be on their toes as long as they are at work. Management considers social and family needs and incorporate it in paid and unpaid time off.
good,"I walk at least a mile a day inside the warehouse. Associates are constantly being shuffled around to handle the load. Emphasis on safety and efficiency on a daily basis. For every 4 hours of work employees get a 15 minute break. Depending on where you may happen to be in the warehouse it could take up to 5 minutes to walk to the break room and another 5 to return to your position, leaving only about 5 minutes break."
good,"Working for Amazon as a packer was one of my favorite job experiences. It was incredibly easy, the hours are just extensive. Keeping up with the pace of customer-placed orders was necessary, especially during the holiday season. You are on your feet all day but the money is totally worth it. Management was encouraging to us."
good,I have worked for Amazon.com for almost 6 years now and I would refer anyone to them. Some managers are in inconstant in how they manage. If you are looking for a job to that pays well then Amazon.com is the place for you.
good,"Good job. Good working crew and friendly. I enjoy my time there, no one really bothered me. Just have to go in, stay focused, do your job, and everything was pretty smooth"
good,"amazon is a fast pace, they all bout making there number, training new hire, finding inventory stowing product, fixing vin number on product, crushing product, moving inventory"
good,its a cool place to work... your always out and about. never have to worry about a manager riding your back... Im entitled to work at my own pace and take a break whenever i want to
good,Really loved it. Had a great experience with all of my coworkers and they really helped me knock out all requirements for the daily tasks at hand. Would recommend this job for anyone.
good,"I absolutely LOVE my job at Amazon, it's sad that it is only seasonal, because I really wanted to stay. I enjoyed it while it lasted; the hours were guaranteed at least 40 per week- and the UPT (Unpaid Time Off) they give you to use for your personal appointments and daily responsibilities is great. I learned a lot about how to help customers solve problems and about the entire process from ordering to receiving is resolved."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for. Training is paid and early managers are great. Unfortunately, once you get out of training, you can get sir pretty unavailable management whom you can't rely on for help."
good,Empresa agradável de trabalhar.Ambiente bom. E bom trabalho em equipe.
good,"Amazon is an awesome company to work for, with great benefits and amazing people. There's lots to do in the warehouse and its pretty good pay for the jobs and schedule."
good,awesome environment  love the people i work with i would prefer anybody to work for amazon fulfillment center leadership human resources and tier 3 everyone is GREAT
good,It is very physical demanding work and very quick paces. The people are good. The hours are long and brakes are way to short. Very very good benefits.
good,"Amazon is a hard working environment, it is centered around customer service and is committed to being a serious and professional job. It has Great benefits and good Opportunities."
good,Great place to work from home for a stay at home parent.  Very flexible so you can work around your kids schedule.  I love it I just wish they paid better.
good,"Took inbound calls. Answered customers questions about their order, refunded, helped customer search for product. Initiated conversation with customer if he or she did not have Prime. The hardest part was the hours I CHOSE. The most enjoyable, never a dull moment. Each customer was a different person, so that would make it interesting."
good,"Amazon is a fast paced company. SDEs here are very talented and work very efficiently. A lot of chance to learn and improve. But in the AWS group, you have to work really hard, since it develops fast."
good,"Amazon is definitely not for everyone, its very fast paced and youre on your feet 10 hours a day. There are some great benefits of working there though. The management isn't the best, but the other associates are helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid."
good,"Honestly, it's a bit dull to do the same thing over and over again, but the pay is good, and it's not customer service. Management is encouraging and involved in the workplace. It's pretty easy to make friends on the warehouse floor, even for the most introverted of people."
good,Agree environment work place to work at Amazon was the best learning different skills and Technology a very fast pace I enjoyed the work working in there 5 minutes
good,Fast-paced easy work with good managers. Lots of giveaways. Friendly managers. There's a high turnover rate. Probably because it's hot in there. Lots of extra hours available.
good,"Typical day: Go as fast as you can without running!"
good,I learned a lot and was moved around a lot. Days flew by as it was fast paced and I had to meet a quota everyday. I do thank them for pushing me to go fast and be efficient as I worked in other warehouse it was a piece of cake. Thank you!!!
good,Great environment as well as opportunity for advancement. Pros would be the managers are extremely laid back and you're usually doing something different which keeps you busy but doesn't leave you exhausted. Con would have to be only a max of 25 hours a week are allowed.
good,"The company is very good but work life balance is bit tough. If you are smart enough , then you can manage both. Career growth is amazing. There are challenges which you may find motivating but this company is not for casual attitude.  You have to prove at every step."
good,"Overall I loved my work through Amazon. I was only seasonal however I was doing very well and it appeared they planned to keep me on but had never been discussed or confirmed. I was due to have my child after the anticipated end date, however they extended me and I had to miss time because of delivery. However the only medical forms my doctors office would give me were not good enough for Amazon's HR to verify why I was out. They gave me a chance to keep working but my login information had been reset during my time away and I could not get back into the system. "
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot and saw how things really worked with Amazon orders. Great company. Was sad to leave. The benefits are amazing.
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for if you are a young person entering into the work force. They have great benefits, but the work load is a little stressful for the older generation who need the pay check to survive in today's economy. Unfortunately the company is a revolving door, but if a person has the stamina it would be a great fit for them."
good,Amazon provides very good place to work. The work culture is very good here. I enjoy every moment working here. People are very nice with each other. Over all very very nice workplace.
good,Its still a day 1 at Amazon everyday is a new day learned what management is and how it puts in a magnitude of efforts to deliver what customer requires.
good,Since I've started Amazon I enjoyed everyday of work. Nothing was too hard to do and everything is quick to learn. It's what you make out of it just like any job.
good,This is a great workplace. Reasonable pay for the work you do and great benefits. They do lack at some things but they definitely do try to help you build your future.
good,"I love being able to work from home.  Management and co workers are great. Training was self paced, which was great, but sometimes I would have liked more."
good,Honestly I love this company I loved working for them I love shopping with them management was great amazing shifts and benefits for working there the only downfall was how we were picked to be full-time and not knowing when we were going to be laid off
good,Amazon is a great place to work for. There are many opportunities to gain stock and is a place known worldwide. Also have great deal for employees and consumers.
good,Amazon Prime is a very good place to work. Most managers need better skills when dealing with employees. That's really the only thing that makes working there difficult
good,Several tasks are simultaneously proceeding at high speed. The company care about physical and mental conditions of employees very much. Employees respect each other.
good,"Amazon was an enjoyable place to work at, even with the mind-numbingly stupid Rate system by which they judge your work on an algorithm based on how much you pack and how fast, regardless of lack of items on the wall or missing/damaged items for orders. That was the only thing that drove me insane and the reason I and others were let go just before the end of PEAK season. The pay was great, but the benefits didn't cover much of anything to the point where they might as well not have had them. Social life and education took a hit here as well, particularly when I worked the 6:30 pm to 5am/6:30am shifts and have to drive straight to class after clocking out. Caffeine was my best friend."
good,Tres agreable pour travailler respect de l'enseignement motivé
good,"Amazon promote growth and enhanced learning, helping people to broaden their horizons and expand their knowledge.  Learned new skills, great teamwork.  Tasks can be challenging, yet that provides for opportunity to learn and grow, as well as to develop teamwork and expand skills and knowledge."
good,"Was a great job to have, Great rewards, and an awesome break room. Clean environment, very secure. There even is a car pooling system for employees that are full-time year round."
good,"Amazon is a tough but fun experience. Work hours are consistent, 40 hour weeks are a guarantee. Expect lots of overtime. A bit tough to adapt at first, due to standing for 10+ and walking 15 miles + a day."
good,"amazon is a warehouse which you have to be able to work 24/7 and lift up to 60 . i work everywhere. dock, packing,picking,stowing, problem solving, drive the order picker and more"
good,"Die Arbeit in Amazon-Graben gefiel mir sehr gut. "
good,work for amazon is perfect job with good staff and friednly some not but job is been perfect and amazon contact emloyer been freidnly and helpfull only agency workers and agency been worst agency dont care about you and quickly you can lose job only if they dont like you they will finnish with you agency is transline group
good,I loved this job. It's fast- paced with friendly competition and high moral. All PPE is provided to you and work assignments are fair and easy to complete.
good,"Great place to work at, fun environment as well. The only thing I could not manage was the 11hr shifts as I am a single mother and found it difficult juggling the shifts with my personal life."
good,"Its a very general warehouse environment, receive orders, stack and store the same products, and later wrap and ship out the product purchased on Amazon.com. Unfortunately, because it was a seasonal employment with some hint of being able to go full time, as soon as their busy season was over they laid of the majority of the people they brought on."
good,"A typical day is either working on picking, receiving items, removals, transship, and or bin counting. It is very nice environment to work at and has nice people. The hardest part is not getting bored. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing something different every day. I learned how to work harder and faster."
good,"company is excellent. management system is somehow not satisfying. less work pressure and candid environment. but if you are in red marked by higher post, it is tough for you to survive."
good,"Great company to work for, but my experience with the low-mid level management has been abysmal. One manager made truly awful hiring decisions consistently, where another wanted to shake up SOP "
good,"No he tenido mucha experiencia laboral aparte de Amazon y otras empresas familiares, y a pesar de haber trabajo con familia, Amazon ha sido el mejor lugar en el que he trabajado. Hay muchas facilidades para el empleado, bonos, buenas instalaciones como lugares de descanso o recreacion haciendo asi las horas laborales manejables y faciles de pasar ya que el trabajo en si es tratar la mayoria del tiempo con clientes molestos y esto no es siempre algo muy alentador."
good,The management does not seem to know their job very well. Everyday they keep switching things around. They don't know what they are doing overall. Willing to fire people who are injured on the job instead of trying to accommodate them
good,Work's good and exciting but can be taxing on personal life. You always get to work on new ideas and projects that actually impact a lot of customers.
good,"This is to Org where every one would love to work. No dress code no need of daily shaving,try your own ideas. Great support from mgt. always eager to improove customer exp better day by day."
good,"As a new comer i was blessed to have a job with Amazon as a warehouse associate the working days are from Monday to Thursday 7.30 pm till 6.00 am. its 10 hour shift of 4 days. From Amazon i got cross trained in different departments including Vertical Reciprocating Conveyor and Powered Industrial Truck (PIT)"
good,Good benefits comes with headaches from management production is alright to work with with the right management. Expect a high turnover rate with production managers.
good,"Pros:"
good,Despite what others have to say i personally Loved working at Amazon the Environment is fast paced and the Pay is Awesome!!! i would suggest if your not a fan of being constantly active it is not the job or place for you.
good,"Préparation des commandes avec scanne "
good,Amazon is a fantastic company to work for and the opportunities available for growth is amazing. This company is customer service orientated as well as employee orientated.
good,"Make sure the drivers get out in time to the UTR agreement."
good,This was my all time favorite Jon. I worked with both Amazon delivery drivers assisting in deliveries as well as working with customers and delivery instrucions.
good,"Intégrer Amazon debut 2000 a été ma grande chance. Plusieurs postes chez Amazon, avec de grandes possibilités d'évolution, et rencontrer des collaborateurs extraordinaire et inventifs."
good,"- Responsible for Catalog enrichment and Quality across multiple categories in the Organisation. "
good,"The people were friendly but the supervisors were toxic. The work was easy , the only problem was my supervisors , they expect too much from people , we can only do so much at a time , we are human"
good,It was an ok place to work I went in got my job done with a smile on my face everyday and in turn I got paid nicely it was very laborous a lot of heavy lifting and very long hours
good,"Management seemed to work long hours in the fulfillment facility. They paid pretty well. Overall, a good experience to see how efficient this company works."
good,"Amazon ist ein sehr guter und zufriedenstellender Arbeitgeber."
good,"Data-oriented, friendly, hardworking, tech-savvy colleagues and managers.  Can learn a lot, personal and professional development, open policies"
good,Just do ur job n ull be fine hit them rates  and come in time and they give good benifits plus I think good pay and also get to know great people and get cert. in certain stations
good,it was the only job I had in my real field. that's why i enjoyed it a lot and wanted to continue it but because of health problems at that time i had to left the job.
good,"freindly enviornment"
good,"It was a good job with many great opportunities but slightly unprofessional due to their systems constantly malfunctioning. I learned several new skills there including packing, gift wrapping, slamming, problem solving, shipping, water spider, and making boxes."
good,"I enjoy working for Amazon & don't mind waking up & going to work.The atmosphere keeps me motivated, & my coworkers/management is amazing, but I want expand my horizons."
good,"The company is great if you want to advance in your career. However, if you do not have a degree, propbably not the place to start to move up. Loved the people."
good,"Post Seasonal job, Part Time Job enjoy the people that i worked around for those short period of time, Amazon was a face but fpace working place but you also have to keep with in order to meet your quarterly inventory and what you pick & pack"
good,Amazon is also a great place to work. They have amazing co-workers and wonderful work ethics which is always followed by employees. It is an employee friendly firm.
good,"Great experience, fun people and was an amazing place to be in the hyper-growth era. Amazing leaders/management and great at sticking to strategy"
good,I enjoy working there. It is a lot of fun. You work a lot of hours when it is peak time. You also can make a lot of extra money during that time too.
good,good working enviroment in leeds branch. good working ethics. office staff are helpfull. hours are not very consistent but it worth working for. flexibility is needed and alot of the work is concentrated on the weekend.
good,"The vast majority of managment is fantastic,the pay and benefits are to be commended but the job security is really the weak point here. Dont expect to stay long"
good,"work on your own."
good,"Excellent company to work for if you are ready to work for a company doing business on a global scale.  Amazon.com definitely values customers as their company culture revolves around it's customers.  Since I worked for this company, I have gained excellent customer service skills to keep customers in the center of everything I do.  Through working here, I have obtained knowledge and experience to work for any company with confidence. I highly recommend working here!!"
good,The job was easy and I enjoyed it however there was no chances at gaining FT employment or a management position. Majority of the employees were hard to get a long with and morale was often times low due to the difficulties a PT warehouse job raises.
good,i worked at amazon and in all the time i was there i enjoyed the job as a whole no issues easy to communicate with all staff being your own boss out on the road and feeling of satisfaction on a daily basis
good,"actually, i worked in home in part time job.my review is 95%"
good,A normal day began with morning meetings at around 8am with the boss taking updates of projects going on with various team members and delegating additional tasks to them if required. Most of the times I would be busy editing some AutoCad drawings and making some 3D models on Inventor.
good,What I liked most about my 5 years working at Amazon was the people I got to work with. They offer great benefits. I literally had 30+ managers while I worked there which was hard on the long time associates as each new manager that came in tried to run things their way. Their expectations from an employee can be unrealistic and breaks are way too short.
good,"Not a bad place to work, there are a lot of things going on a one time so its imperative that you keep your head on a swivel.  The 10 hour shift goes by pretty fast depending on what you are doing at the time.  From processing to indirect functions, it is a very cool place to work!"
good,I work from home so I am able to have a very flexible schedule and I love that. I actually miss the face to face contact with customers but  my overall day is amazing. My management team is awesome and my virtual co-workers is amazing. The hardest part of my job is at times knowing that a customer wasn't able to get their package on time when they really needed if for a special occasion. I really enjoy helping the customers at the end of the day when I am able to help the customer smile by the end of the call I have done my job well.
good,"I loved working for Amazon, because of the customer contact, good or negative, where you can turn a person's whole day around by finding a resolution for their issue. However, there is a push to be quick about finding that resolution, so the customer experience can be turned negative if you hurry with them. A lot of my customers were elderly and electronically-challenged, and they appreciated me taking the time with them to help fix or set up their products, or issue refunds for faulty products."
good,"I really enjoyed having this job. it's one of those job that i understood how to do. Its was too bad that it was only temporary. I got along with a everyone there. We all worked like a team. If someone needed help there were always people to help out, even if they were busy. This job made me realize that there are some good jobs out there"
good,Job is tiring. Standing up and walking around for hours gets a little frustrating. The job is very away it's just the standing for long hours and walking around a huge ware house. I did not like the short breaks.
good,"Hard work, long hours but great exercise!  Constantly on the move, management is young as well as the facility, so rough edges are still being smoothed out.  Thought there would be room for advancement but that doesn't seem to be a possibility.  Overall I feel the company is great, very employee oriented."
good,Le poste est difficile en sachant que nous étions debout pendant 8h voir 9h d'affilé.
good,"Overall good employer, amazing benefits, great teams to work with, young company with young leaders and visions. customer service and safety are very important."
good,"Training every area, knowledge of company, customer service skills, time mangement day to day."
good,Amazon is a good to place work at. And the benefits are great with the type of work I was doing. Also they don't overwork you and hurry you up unless your going exponentially slow.
good,I had a great experience working with Amazon. Fun and comfortable work place. Great manager and Ambassador teams. Excellent benefits. Flexible work schedule.
good,Learned many new things while working with different team members of HR services.while working with other HR team members got to know what all different stuffs we have in our work environment.
good,Its a fun job with a lot of walking and with many of interesting people. This job offer a may benefits with a good hourly pay and has a safety environment.
good,I picked items of the shelves for customers that order things. That was my job I did everyday I was scheduled to work
good,"It's a good place to work but the management needs a little bit of improvement, other than that it was a good job. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"My previous organisation was fun loving and educative platforms."
good,"This job you can do mostly in the summer because your customers buy your products and services on that part of the year, therefore, is a temporary job but very nice place to work"
good,"I temporally worked there from 2013-2014 starting at the month of October 2013 to January of 2014. Also from October 2014 to February 2015. It had a good pay and if hired full-time offered health care benefits. I usually sit in one spot for either receiving and also shipping. In other occasions I moved around in the warehouse and did other works in the building: Organizing, transfer of items, stocking for transfer, and small item shipping."
good,I normally work night shift with amazon. long hours with less toilet break. free drink. work place is fun. picking and packing goods for delivery. good pay rate and holiday
good,Enjoyed a lot in this company.And also learned so many new things and developed my skills in coding also.They provided an absolutely cool environment to work on and made the working easier.
good,"It was good to work for this company, gave me an idea of how to work with an employer who believed in diversification.  A typical day for me was solving customer's issues with lost, stolen, or late packages being delivered.  I learned that you must be able to deal with all ethnicity's.   "
good,good work environment excellent benefits work 4 days off 3 voluntary sometimes mandatory over time a lot of walking constant moving at a fast pace have to keep a certain rate
good,Working at your own pace makes it easier to control how much pay you make that is actually based on your effort rather than simply a base wage.
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon.  I am looking for a job with a more stable schedule. Amazon offers excellent benefits and a good working environment.  I simply want a job with a bit less overtime involved.  During peak times employees are required to work up to sixty hours a week for six weeks or more at a time.
good,No complaints other than shipping and receiving dispatching you a cart later than they really should. The job stability is nice if you can maintain a steady number of delivery hours a week.
good,A typical day is busy and requires discipline to meet required daily production. The most enjoyable part of this job is training and developing of staff.
good,"always changing jobs to do, all the management are into their work and build relationships with employees, Always fun to come to work there is always something to do."
good,I love this job ! Would definitely reccomend this to a friend. Hardest point is after break but its still fun. Management is nice. Enjoyable part is getting off or knowing the flex call
good,"Outside of being told less than 24 hours that you will be required for mandatory overtime and that you get no future notice of being laid off from the job, working for Amazon is great!!"
good,"Amazon has a culture of moving fast and exceeding expectations."
good,"I enjoyed working as a team member and the supervisors were nice. I thought some decisions were stange, but just went with thw flow and enjoyed my time."
good,day goes by fast I work night shift and night shift is pretty smoth when October comes its peak season the worst time of all
good,"Super Arbeitsklima durch nette Kollegen und Vorgesetzte."
good,"lost weight immediately, enjoyed working indoors in a secure environment! Great managers and co workers alike. Worked 2 consecutive peaks, worked both day shift then night shift!"
good,"Every Day at work was a great learning experience, had got an opportunity to handle multiple process, Challenging work environment, co-workers were pretty amicable, the most enjoyable part of job was work from home at times when required support"
good,"Buena empresa, pero dificil de mantenerse por bastante tiempo."
good,Ho avuto davvero una bella esperienza in questa azienda cosi grande ! Sono molto soddisfatto di averla fatta.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management team. Very fast paced shipping area. Daily tasks included supervising a team of 20-40 associates which increased to 100+ employees on my team during peak season. "
good,great workplace and workers. not small salary. can working long hours and that is really great!  WORK day in this place ending faster. Friendly  workers and all personal.
good,Always the best Customer Service. Friendly clients and employees. I love getting to know our company clients and engaging in good constructive conversation. Assist with PTP Specials and Overtime options.
good,A typical day at Amazon was fast and efficient. Managers would gather the employees and they would have a team meeting where we talk about the volume and stretch before we start to work. We would work and managers would hand out candy and other treats for the workers. If you worked hard we would get the volume done early we could leave early with pay.
good,"Clocked in and got straight to work."
good,I enjoy working for Amazon.com.  Its a fun fast paced environment to work in.  I enjoy working with the people there and they offer great benefits and growth opportunities.  The pay is great!
good,"A typical day as a Gemba Process Assistant will always include engaging associates, collecting feedback, and promoting safety. As a secondary responsibility, I am a project owner and ambassador in process improvement, seeking to make the work environment a more efficient, safe, and overall better experience."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management and colleagues ."
good,"Love the Experience at Amazon,its making me to be a more responsible and more manageable person. My Managers have a lot of trust and confidence in me and my work performance"
good,Best place to learn a lot and do a lot of interesting things. But the problem would be the non technical managers deciding architecture of the systems.
good,Good work environment to be in. Management very helpful and wanting you to learn how to do multiple jobs within the facilities. Always willing to help. Clean work environment
good,that was such a nice place too work. that was a temporary work during the christmas period. i do really miss that place. that was a good experience to work there
good,"Amazon. com is one of the coolest place a person can ever work, He will have a wide range of exposure but should be careful with the work being done. There is a lot of distractions such as games and fun, and there will also be lot of work to finish. I am proud to say that I was a part of amazon.com"
good,Amazon is a great place to work. on some lunch breaks they give out free pretzels and chic-fil-a comes to the job on some days. everyone works together. they have a strict safety policy so I never worried about getting injured. co-workers and managers want to see you succeed. overall a decent place to work with reasonable amount of pay.
good,"A day of work here could consist of stowing packages or scanning packages virtually from location to location. The majority of the positions require continuous heavy lifting. At times, the atmosphere is very laid back.  I learned how the reverse logistics process works.  This company is very diverse.  The hardest part of the job is trudging through the sixty hour over time weeks.  Meeting new people was a very enjoyable part of this job."
good,Great company to work for!!! Training is awesome and learned a lot about the company. Great management team. Customers are great and enjoyed every moment of it.
good,Just a regular small business with very down to earth staff and management. Very patient and willing to work with my schedule as needed.
good,Great place to work for young workers. Great place for college students. Most employees are in their twenties and thirties. Great pay and benefits for full time employees.
good,"la journée commence par aller regarder l'affichage des postes, grande polyvalence si on a été formé. ce qui permet de ne pas faire tout le temps le même travail et donc de ne pas se lasser. ensuite les managers nous disent le volume a faire pour le journée et en profitent pour nous rappeler certaines consignes de sécurité. "
good,"good place to work."
good,"Amazon was an workout with them, its alot of walking to do"
good,"I would answer customer service calls from customer who needed help with things like tracking their packages, placing orders on the website, canceling services and accounts, and refunding orders and fees. We would communicate with co-workers and employers across the country via a chat service, provided by the company. I would help co-workers answer questions about policies and procedures, and show them where they could find the information in the future."
good,"Tal como ya se conoce, la empresa Amazon es la tienda  online mas grande del mundo. Es un placer trabajar para ellos. "
good,"There is no time to be a bad worker in this work place environment. With it's fast paced sorting and packaging positions and quotas to meet, it forces you to become very involved and responsible for your production. I enjoyed the people and work environment the most. The hardest part of the job is the mandatory overtime during peak season."
good,It was a decent way for me to challenge myself to go faster when getting items out to be packed. It felt like a video game after a while.
good,"die Arbeit ist abwechslungsreich habe Spaß gemacht!"
good,This is a very good company which like to take care of there customers and also there employees and provides a lot of work with overtime.
good,"The job was very physically demanding at times but it paid very well and there was always more jobs coming available, or new things to be trained in so it kept things fresh. You were guarunteed a raise but it topped off. But it was very good pay, plenty for me and i hand't topped off yet. It was very easy to learn everything and there was always work to be done, and usually overtime offered."
good,"Come in, clock in. Get your materials needed for work (normally a scanner). Go to your stand up area, stretch, news for the day, go to assigned area and begin task. At amazon, I learned attendance (one day out was a lot out of paycheck), I learned the important of teamwork, but to be self sufficient at the same time. Management is all how you approach and interact with them. One manager was ok with me, but had problems with others, etc. Coworkers, some of them were honest, hard workers. Others were there really for the paycheck. Hardest part of the day was getting up so early, and 10 hour work shifts. And 6 days straight during peak season...Which entails best part of the job. Peak pay. Especially with VCP. $1100-1500 dollar paychecks. Wonderful, but very physically demanding."
good,"defiantly a great place overall, amazing productivity goals and more then 85% time hit their goals, great benefits and pay, management seems forgetful at times"
good,"Very hard on your feet, and fast environment that is congested to complete your job, but great pay"
good,"enjoyed my time here but sometimes the targets are extreme even tho i always hit them, cudnt really interact with other workers as u had to stay on your own packing section . Management was laid back and expected you to always do your best and just left you to do your work."
good,Although you are in a factory the work is not labor intensive. It's actually pretty easy but can get boring. The pay is good for what you do and it's a great company to work for.
good,"* never a dull moment"
good,Good experience to learn new things and keep in trend with the market technologies
good,"A typical day at works start with a group stretch and flex along with a motivational pep talk. Once that is over everyone grabs a cart, totes, and a RF gun and everything is like a race."
good,"The environment is great however the HR is completely all over the place. I was training people to do there jobs and they were getting promoted to leads and still asking for advice. Pay is decent, very hard work."
good,"show up too work zone do exercises,log into scanner,go too floor get your materials too fill customers orders"
good,Amazon managers play favorites. The hardest part was the fatigue and working night shift. I enjoyed getting to know people. Typical day was non stop till you clock out.
good,amazon its excellent place for work u can learn and pick up lots of skills from there
good,"I spent 12 years at Amazon starting in 1997. I learned so much from the management and staff and accomplished things I never though possible. It's not an easy place to work. The hours are long and the work is difficult and challenging. But if you can hang you will benefit greatly. "
good,"é stata un'esperienza molto significativa per me; l'organizzazione dell'azienda in ogni settore è molto curata e l'ambiente lavorativo è giovane, sereno e stimolante."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. It's customer focused and strong on ownership and leadership.
good,Amazon is a respectable company. I am honored to spend my summer with so many talented and motivated people.
good,"the work place as a whole I believe it is really good, you go to work and you know what to expect, there are times where you have to work really quickly to so the the priority orders are out."
good,A great place to work especially for Java developers and any one around open source who would like to work in a creative environment where there is a chance to create your own tools and applications.
good,"* Awesome mangement"
good,"Had a great time working there.Leads were great.Godd hours.I learned how to use a scanner,ship and receive and also how to pack.Co-workers were helpful."
good,I enjoy working at Amazon. You get treated fairly by the managers and team leaders. My typical day would consist of many different duties which i found challenging but enjoyable. I have gained more experience and feel more confident doing many different warehouse duties.
good,I would have like to work permanently there.  my assignment was too short
good,"Uma Empresa Dinâmica e  que possibilitou muito novas experiências na minha vida profissional. Comandada Pelo Gerente muito comunicativo, paciente e compressível, ensinando-nos a melhor maneira de trabalhar em equipe. Organizando os setores através da comunicação o que tornou muito agradável o ambiente de trabalho. A parte mais desagradável para mim é que cumprido esse desafio. Sinto-me com potencial de querer novos desafios futuro, o que me levou a disponibilizar-me para futuras experiências."
good,"Skills - Management, Coaching, Continuous Improvement, Supply Management, Risk Assessment, Cross-functional Team Leadership, Team Management, Transportation, Inventory Management, Business Process Improvement, Lean Manufacturing, Process Improvement, Program Management, Training Delivery, Supply Chain Optimization, Law Enforcement/Police Experience, Logistics Management, Value Stream Mapping, Leadership"
good,"I always looked forward going to work, i enjoyed my work. I've learn't to respect other people and their beliefs. Even though sometimes i didn't reach my target my manager will always encourage us to do better. I can't say a lot about about the staff but we managed to put our differences aside and tried to work as a team. Hardest part of the job was that we had to meet our monthly targets every month so no play and sometimes no lunch. And the emjoyable, ofcause payday."
good,I was in Email Support had good time learnt things which were useful for future knowledge
good,"typical day is when order exceed over 200,000"
good,"we have a saying at amazon, the only thing that is consistent at amazon is change. this job is not for the faint of heart. you will be challenged mentally and physically. there are a ton of things you will learn most of them will be changed by the time you get use to them, but it is one of the best learning experiences of my life. stay humble and willing to be molded and you will be a good amazonian"
good,"	Provided Level II technical support for Kindle devices"
good,"i had a great time working here, all the management was friendly and helpful, the hardest part of the job was remembering where everything was"
good,"A typical day at work is busy but fun and i have learned a lot of skills that have helped me become to great employer i am today. The management is great and easy going, yet they are people you can look up to and aspire to be like in the future. There really isn't a hard part to my job as long as you pay attention to what you are doing and work more then play your job will be easy to complete."
good,Standing for the full shift was difficult at first but you get use to it within a week. I learned to operate forklifts and use technical support with the scanners we had to use for every product. All co-workers were very friendly and helped benifit the company. There was nothing really hard about the job at all it came simple to me. I loved just seeing my co-workers everyday it was like a big family.
good,7:30 start with stretching and daily info
good,"my day at work consist of 10 hours shifts with just standing, i learned to be quick on my feet and very safe, managment was pretty decent, coworkers were great, hardest part was lifting and standing for 10 hours with no sitting, enjoyable part was the great money and learning experiences"
good,"A typical day at work went the same everyday. I learned more how Amazon.com functions and how other retailers probably follow the same model of work. Management was kind although sometimes my concerns were never addressed. Co-workers were fun to work with and not as negative as other co-workers I have worked with. The hardest part of the job was the hours and the walking. However, I truly enjoyed all of it."
good,It was a great place to work i met a lot of amazing people. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 4am 6 days a week but i really enjoyed it.
good,"It was a face paced job that I enjoyed alot. There are so many workers thou, that it is hard to know who your manager was."
good,worked on chinese e-books. auditing the books and making the books error free for onsite launching.
good,I loved this company but stopped believing in them and that is when I quit. It was really hard to leave this company because you can make a living. I had to leave but I will tell anybody to seek employee with them.
good,Working on creating/maintaining Customer Reviews API and enhancing frontend behavior.
good,you work as one big team to process order for the world.you are supprised to to see all the things that are shipped in a day.GREAT PAY!
good,A typical day was like going to this warehouse we you got to chill all day but the chilling was working. The managers were amazing they interacted with us all the time we where having dinners and winning prizes. The co-workers where so fun to be around the hardest part was trying to stay awake but the most enjoyable part was being able to count on your co-workers for support and help.
good,Job management could have been organized better. A typical work day was very fast and busy from start to finish. I learned how use a scanner and how to get used to the fast pace work ethic. The co-workers were friendly and always willing to help.
good,enjoyed working with no pressure.
good,Work was great. I learned to do payroll and taxes quarterly here. I also learned to keep spreadsheets for inventory.
good,Work place at Amazon is really fun loving. You will have all the facilities that you require at your work place. Co-workers are very cooperative. Sometimes there are politics in going to higher positions .Hardest part of the job is need to struggle a lot and lot for next level.Performance and caliber are not the only things that are gauged.Most enjoyable part is celebrating all the events.Most importantly it has high hiring bar.
good,Very flexible job people are friendly in helpful great opportunity for people who  are willing to earn extra money in their spare time. The job is simple you just shop for items that located in the store.
good,This place is one of the best places to work at if you have a open schedule but overall it was a good idea to have when they pay $15 an hour for the 5 days
good,"Really enjoyed my experience working with Amazon, met some great people, managment were supportive, food in csnteen could be improved but is cheap as chips. Would recommend"
good,It was an easy job unfortunately it was hard on my back with all the heavy lifting. I had back surgery some years back so it just wasn’t the right job for me. The environment was great.
good,"Good training "
good,"I’m super grateful for the opportunity and growth of character that I’ve experienced at Amazon. I’m almost working there for 2 years, and can look back and identify growth spurts within myself.. I am however looking for something more calm in terms of not too much of a stressful environment."
good,They pay good. The work is very reparative but I still enjoyed it. The only con is that your schedule is set the same every week and in order to request a day off without getting negative points if you need to accumulated personal time. They do give you schedules to choose during the hiring process.
good,Amazon is a great company to work for  the atmosphere is great  the benefits are amazing as well  I recommend It to anyone looking for a great job  youn
good,"Es la mejor empresa q e trabajado, excelentes instalaciones muy buen ambiente de trabajo ojala me llamen pronto para seguir trabajando con amazon."

good,I love the breaks two 15 min after being there 3 hours. then a  one 30 min to get a good meal and start back for the shift to work 4 hours  to get another 15 min break. . You have time off on weekends to do family things. a 4 day 10 to 12 hours of work. if you do 12 hours you get another 15 min break two hours before going home.
good,Mi trovo benissimo ottimo posto di lavoro. Tutti aiutano tutti collaborazione massima tra dipendenti.
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, salaire raisonnable."
good,"I have worked at two different locations and the difference in the management is obvious. Not really in a bad way, but one location was definitely more lacks than the other."

good,"Working for Amazon was a great experience. My profession is in customer service, however I liked working for Amazon. Management was not so great but I managed."
good,They teach you on the spot.  The manger  helps you when you need it. The pay is fair and the hours are flexible.  Amazon is a get company if you get fired they will always hair you back in if you mess up.
good,"I was working at Amazon 8 months (until I quit)and I was having all this time only high productivity and quality target couple of months consecutive, no absence, no incidents, no delays, and still I didn't get a blue badge.Those who had a blue badge, was having only 85% of target, I was never doing under 100%, because I loved my job.All the leaders,and managers was appreciated me"
good,"Great job for the right person. The rules give you some freedom , however when peak season hits the overtime is mandatory. For some people that would be a issue unless the planned before the peak season. They would probally get a write up and or some type of management interaction."
good,Credo che per lavorare in Amazon bisogna essere stimolati dalle sfide perché qui in qst azienda le sfide sono all ordine del giorno. Ambiente di lavoro pulito.
good,"I enjoy working at Amazon. I like knowing what is expected of me and what I need to get done each day without a lot of complications. The work is physical, especially for someone, like me, who is a little bit older than some of the workers.. it may take a while to adjust to the physical nature of the job, but once you get used to it the day goes fairly smoothly."
good,"I’ve been driving with Flex for several months now! There is almost always availability to make money! It’s not something your going to get rich doing, but I knock out my car payment and sometimes half of my mortgage by delivering. I set my own schedule and my husband even tags along for the ride occasionally."
good,They always want people to constantly working. they are way cool if you talk but must hit rate every time. Very cool place to work. Would work with them again.
good,I loved working at Amazon. It was a challenge. You had to meet certain quotas daily.  Kept you in shape because you were constanly moving. It was very fast paced.
good,"Great place to work but is not secure as a permanent job , I love the schedule close to home not commuting to Hayward anymore, good coworkers, security agency are to exsaturate"

good,It’s a nice place to work it’s a fast place and they work with people schedules they have a lot of opportunities there u can learn a lot of different things there that what I like about it
good,"Grosse journée de travail, très bonne entente avec les managers"
good,Okay as your first Job and for an Experienced Individual
good,All staf cooperative and has good skils and i did work there one month
good,the best place to work in india and the life style at the site is second to none except the HR dept they will not give you full details on your contract but if you are permanent there its is one of the best place to find your future in india
good,"Benefits are spectacular, hard work, decent money do your job and mind your business and you’ll be fine. Pros: Good pay and great benefits "
good,Good teamwork employees and good hours.. its fast paced and its real easy but hard physically walking all the shift.. only 30 min of lunch but day goes by fast.
good,I came to Amazon as a seasonal worker. I have enjoyed being able to learn different roles besides just scanning.  I have found that 95% of the people (management and reg. employees) are very helpful and pleasant.
good,its is a good place. I will go back again next year.  I have been working there for the last past two years only for the seasonal time. I have also told other people to work there too
good,"Working at the Amazon Fulfillment center was very fun."
good,The money is really good ! They offer a lot of VET! although if you’re a picker it really sucks ! I hated my sore feet after 12 hours of walking ! And the breaks suck!
good,"The people at the Amazon Warehouse are hardworking people that are trying to make a living, it feels like a family when you work there. You have a consistent number of hours and great benefits."
good,"The overall job was okay. It wasn’t to challenging, just make sure you choose a good schedule that works around your life. They could of also had a little more time added to their breaks."
good,"Die Arbeit bei Amazon.com hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Ich hätte mir gewünscht, dass mein Vertrag verlängert wurde. Sehr gerne möchte ich wieder da arbeiten."
good,Not a place to work for if you want to be treated with honesty and respect. They don’t give you opportunities for advancement ..  ////////// no full time work
good,"Ambiente lavorativo molto bello, consiglio a tutti"
good,Se aprenden cosas nuevas referentes a tecnología continuamente
good,"I was seasonal and they laid me off right after new Year's day without warning, would of been nice to know in advance. But you show up for work, they have stand up meetings everyday. They are respectful. The App they use to deliver sucks. They overload you with packages. But for the ,most part, I loved my job. OH yeah, long hours."
good,"They were 10 hour work days with 2 half an hour breaks which worked well for me. One was paid and one was unpaid. You work with thousands of people within this buisness so it's nice to meet new people however you don't have much time to do so considering you're in a station by yourself throughout the whole day. That is the hardest part of the job, standing long hours with barely no energy due to lack of interaction. The money and environment made up for all the bad most days."
good,Everyone has to work together in order for product to be complete. Its a busy job and good opportunity to grow and learn others department. Great benefit and overtime
good,"very organized and fast pace work, I love the work I get to compete with people around me doing the correct way and doing it in proper time as they insist."
good,"Great Job, I just wish they would do us better. It’s a lot of improving that needs to be done! We work extremely hard & it goes unnoticed at times! We don’t have full amazon gear & our safety is put at risk sometimes! I make the best of it & continue to do what needs to be done!"

good,Would recommend Amazon’s a best work place . Best learning experience on live projects . Real time view of the vicinity on warehouse as well as the FC’s
good,"Pensavo di dover faticare di più,ma un lavoro molto intenso e organizzato"
good,"I was previously employed through Integrity Staffing to work at Amazon, but am only on active status currently. Payroll was always on time and fair. Opportunities for growth and advancement always are available for employees who wish to make a solid career for themselves. Hours and work assignments are steady and the company has consistent performance."
good,Great place to work at in Middletown del we look for orders all day had 2 breaks and one 30 minute lunch. U meet in people and the staff was great i would work there again and again ever time
good,Amazon is an all around company that emphasize respect and fairness to their customers and employees. They give their employees a sense of worth and let them know that they are appreciated.
good,"I love working at the warehouse, however, the location I am currently at is basically you pick your own schedule. It is like playing the hunger games when trying to pick a shift. I am a single parent trying to raise two children. I cannot afford to only work one 5 hour shift a week. I need more stability and more hours at the same pay rate."
good,The company was well organized and managed. They thoroughly screened each applicant and made sure everyone knew their respective roles. A culture that was very pleasant and welcoming.
good,"È  un ambiente abbastanza giovanile , creano attività per rendere partecipe il lavoratore. La sicurezza  del dipendente per loro è al primo posto"
good,"buona posizione contrattuale,"
good,People worked so many hours we were ran ragged. If you aren't at work your sleeping. Family life near holidays? Forget about it. Building is so large you spent most of lunch waking down 3 or 4 flights of stairs.
good,"Amazon is a company that is about number. They look for individuals that are willing to challenge themselves on a daily basis. They accept no shortcuts and want you to accept your mistakes. It can be challenging, stressful or fun. It depends on the type of person you are and how much you can tolerate management that can be brutally honest and will point a finger. Some infractions will result in termination, others a simple write up. Either way, know the do's and don'ts of the company."
good,I enjoyed working at amazon the staff was polite the hours was fast paced but it taught me how to work quickly and safely in a work environment the staff and easily there to help if there is any struggles
good,"This is a company that I can recommend friends and family members to work for because of the various benefits provided, good pay, flexible schedule, school accommodations, ..."
good,the management there accommodates irrespective of your color. very friendly management and ready to help when in need. the scanners are always on track and very efficient to work with.
good,"Amazon Development Centre is a call center that strives customer satisfaction, they put their customers first, always, they are one of the best retailers in the world."
good,Cool Place to work.  People are helpful and friendly. The rest of this review is to satisfy the 150 word minimum for this review process. I good though!
good,"12 years ago i used to work for Amazon.com from India Location, it was awesome experience working for Amazon.com. I got an opportunity to work for multiple projects and i have managed successfully."
good,Don’t think it’s relevant as the rating would speak for itself . Do not have anything further to say as rating would be speaking for itself in the environment
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Learn and grow is the culture in Amazon, Learn be productive and grow in your vertical."
good,Job is fast paced n hard to keep up pace at times but my Amb Christine rocked at putting us where performed the best n always listened when we had problem. Coffee n HC always available free gl9ves n tools needed to perform our jobs. .Feel like a team.
good,Amazon is a great and diverse company to work for. You are never judged for your looks are where you come from. You are encouraged to think outside the box to take care of a customer.
good,"Azienda multinazionale che ti apre le porte ad un futuro, con la possibilità di fare carriera. Mi piacerebbe entrare nuovamente a far parte della grande famiglia di Amazon"
good,It was a good experience but I understand safety is a big deal but they take it a little to extreme great people good managers and fun experience safety people suck
good,"Loved my job and the people I work with. "
good,It was a great experience. I learned to work over midnight. I sometimes worked until 8am. I usually work there at night. I met some cool people there. The warehouse had a great temperature there to for weather. The place is also great on safety.
good,Co-workers and management were really easy to get along with. I enjoyed working there. They are very caring of their employees. A very understanding group of individuals.
good,"Great work place, good salary, benefits could have been better. Work is very fast paced and demands consistent learning and improving. Office space gas improved drastically after the new hyderabad office."
good,Il posto era bello a i contratti fanno schifo dopo 3 mesi ti lasciano a casa
good,"At Amazon, learn new things every day and learned how to use a scanner, sort boxes on each bag of zip codes. Help other teammates. The thing that I loved is that it was a very fast pace and was moving around and help others and not be standing in one place. I like to be very moving and working hard."
good,"1) shift plans"
good,Amazon is a very customer experience driven company who drives ideas to implementation very quickly.  Fast paced management by controlled chaos is the general mode.  This is a great place to work if you like working on innovative products that impact most people.
good,"It's a good solid company to work for. The job expectations are realistic. The company seems to care about it's employees, and they offer good benefits package."
good,"👍🏼Esperienza positiva, molto stimolante e posto bello"
good,"Great place to work and learn. Amazon gives a lot of flexibility to the employees to try out and implement new ideas at work place."
good,"Was an Holiday work  Didn’t stay that long to really know the company that much. But I believe they can still do better taking care of the employees"
good,Great place to work. Great people to work for. The night went by pretty fast. Very busy and I had to do alot of walking. But overall I think it was the best.
good,"Per chi come me è un appassionato della storia dei grandi colossi non poteva certamente mancare l'esperienza nel settore della logistica che più ha sconvolto l'economia negli ultimi 20 anni. Lavorare da Amazon comprende al proprio interno un pò tutto di quello che si è sentito e letto nei giornali. In una delivery station arrivano decine di migliaia di pacchi ogni sera, con i volumi che si raddoppiano nei momenti di picco del Black Friday e del periodo natalizio. Le mansioni sono molte, varie, la noia non ti assale ma la fatica si sente svolgendo qualsiasi delle mansioni durante il periodo notturno(00-06). I ritmi sono sostenuti, vi è un continuo afflusso di nuovi dipendenti assunti tramite agenzia, in percentuale i dipendenti assunti da Amazon rasentano il 20%. Coloro che non si dimostrano parte di un ingranaggio oramai collaudato e vincente non vengono riconfermati dopo il periodo iniziale dei tre mesi o nella peggiore delle ipotesi dopo il periodo di prova delle sette giornate lavorative."
good,Lavoro bellissimo struttura bellissima solo che ci sono molti colleghi alla prima esperienza lavorativa quindi molti disguidi ma sorvolabili
good,"Fast Paced, Great Exercise, Excellent Benefits, Everyone pretty much was able to be themselves and there wasn't any discrimination towards anyone! Really enjoyed my job in the Sort Department. I made several friends while working who I still keep in touch with almost daily!"
good,Ho passato quatro mese sanza difficoltà e con i managers exellent.
good,Great place to work and start your career in the wearhouse field   The hours are fexible and there’s a lot of ok the job training. Also there’s a lot of incentives
good,Its Actually not a bad place to work I’d still be there if the brakes were a little longer because for 10 hours standing on your feet with two 30 minute breaks isn’t enough but the three days off and four days on was a great
good,"Everything is timed , you are timed and need to maintain a certain goal everyday. They are very cool. They don't bother you and try to help you. It gets crazy when the trucks come in to get the packages."
good,"In the office, they make sure everyone is having fun. I learned to multitask. The management is great and approachable. Most of the time it really gets busy. There are a few supports. The enjoyable part is you start the shift with games and/or coaching/huddle."
good,"All routes are not local. They give you various routes though which most people dont like. I dont mind. Amazon makes it easy, thier setup makes it easy to deliver."
good,My Day were simple yet very busy. Most times you get the same routes and the team you work with are very friendly. id highly recommend it if you like to be active and be your own boss.
good,Desiring to work hard and learn all you can on a daily basis benefits you as an employee. Management is there to provide you with answers to questions  you may have to job openings available within an Amazon facility.
good,"At Amazon, it's all about productivity and time. As an associate, you're going to learn new things, I've packed boxes, picked, and stowed at amazon the manager there are encouraging and helpful. when you are picking, packing, or stowing, depending on what you are doing there is a rate for everything. if you don't meet your rate you are likely to get written up. However, the hardest part of doing the job is standing."
good,enjoyed working for the company because i felt like they really cared about their employees and their well-being. the work environment was always clean and well organized.
good,"Amazing place to work, they treat workers there really well and act like one big family, they always helped you if you messed up on something, that always teached and maybe everyone feel good about themselves"
good,"I worked solid 8 hour days with small teams and a few great managers. Being part of the customer support teams, I was held to performance metrics that were generally easy to meet. My coworkers were extremely helpful and friendly when asked for help or about issues. The environment can be very different based on the location, but Amazon provides great benefits and resources for those motivated to reach out about them."
good,"The pay is fantastic for what is essentially a manual labor, very low-skilled job.  At Sewickley, most of the coworkers are refreshingly upbeat and friendly.  Lots of small perks and incentives are offered to encourage morale and motivation.  It is a physically demanding job, but although employees are asked to keep up a high rate of work, a lot of mercy is shown toward those with physical disadvantages.  As with any workplace, there are some coworkers who are lazy and will do as little as they can to get by, and there are certainly some managers who are more pleasant than others.  But for people who appreciate an honest day's pay in return for an honest day's labor, it's a great place to earn a paycheck."
good,The work can be very tedious but if you enjoy meeting new people and having a conversation it can become quite fun. It pays better than most warehouse jobs and overtime can really increase you money intake.
good,"the management was horrible, no open door policy, great coworkers and very fun . made the day go quick getting to listen to music. we had discounts on amazon.com"
good,Having to wake up at 5:30 a.m and having to be at work by 6:00a.m and also have to be on the floor by 6:10a.m it was very tiring but once you get a drink of the complimentary hot chocolate there’s nothing to worry about .
good,Was very satisfied to work there. Had a option of a promotion very fast. But thr temp agency didnt get to hire anymore to blue badges. So was a temp job. A good one
good,"Day in day out the daily grind,  Not so bad you do meet different people.  some of the supervisor are friendly.  The main floor manager goes by the book and nothing in between so follow all procedures accordingly and do your job safely and quickly."
good,"Challenging work  Great people, good compensation, only drawback is its contract work  The assignments are limited to projects and available budgets of the clients"
good,Working at Amazon allowed me to work when I wanted. The Managers were great. Being retired as an a older employee they were patient with my limited abilities. Wis there was a Amazon facility in Ocala. I would love to work for them again.
good,"The pay is good. Way better than my last job, race trac. I work half the hours and make more. But it can be a bit stressful at times. And most importantly definitely stay hydrated."
good,Like working for company. Great hours and benefits. Up beat atmosphere. Although I miss working in restaurant industry. I enjoy working with the public.

good,Lot of learning Opportunities. You will have an opportunity to learn more than you job responsibilities if you're willing to explore. has strong encouragement for folks with lower experience to grow into roles if you have enough talent.
good,Amazon was a great job experience. I met a lot of people who I am still close to. Working at Amazon you build a team and your co-workers become your family.
good,"I loved it at Amazon. The work environment was good, safe, and well stock for work. The only thing I dislike was, I was temporary. So when the job ended they let me go over the phone."
good,I love it. It Is an  easy pace job with great pay. In the position that I work beings though it is part time their is any pat advancement opportunities. BUt their is nothing hard about the actual job itself
good,"I think Amazon BDL 5 was very accelerating.  For years prior I've been trying to get that warehouse feeling back.  Amazon fulfilled that for me, with the exception of the PIT instruction that was stressed during the orientation.  I was told that I get instruction on how to operate the familiarize piece of equipment, for Amazon warehouse.  Besides the technical greed of wanting to say I was a pot driver. It's a great workplace."
good,"Delivering packages with a smile and seeing my customers happy and saying they get excited when they see the Prime trucks pulls up makes my day! "
good,"I enjoy my job. It's physical and because of my health issues I can not work full/part timr, so I work a shift they have called Alpha. And it allows me to supplement my income without having a regular schedule. I enjoy everything I do I can do all jobs I have suggested to both my children to apply, they did and they LOVE it too. I would suggest Amazon to anyone looking for a good paying job, with flexibility."
good,Un poco desorganizados pero excelente servicio solo falto algo más de comprensión con los empleados
good,Amazon is a clean safe inviroment to work at.nice pay and good scheduling hours.i would recommend to my friends to work there.good pay and vacation time
good,Amazon provides a very well structured leadership that ensures optimum performance by employees with adequate support and an approach that's based on Amazon's leadership principles. All employees have access to the top leadership for addressing any issue that is hindering a positive performance while working at Amazon.
good,The work invirment was nice everyone had each other back. I learned a lot as far floor jacks. As far as inventory skills went to another level. Kinda wish I never moved .I would never left the job. I was excited to go to work we had a lot of fun.
good,Meet alot of different people from different places. They have all kind of incentives and give aways. Beautiful cafeteria. Plenty breaks. Always opportunity to grow or advance.
good,I personally don’t like how you can pick one shift then they switch it up. However i would recommend the job due to the relaxed environment and amazing pay rate!
good,its great company but management can stress you ou to much as your just seen as a number not a single person they put on fun events inside the workplace and they do try to make it worthwhile
good,"Exercise, grab scanner, go to requested location on job board, scan boxes , place boxes on proper pallets. learned more about scanners. the hardest part of job the job pace."
good,I enjoyed myself working at Amazon for the couple once I was there nice managers clean place good environment I would recommend this place to family and friends to work at
good,"Enjoyed working there except for the travelling. Good people and reasonable pay. Not good or practical for me as i live in Edinburgh."
good,"I think this job gives a lot of people a chance to achieve a lot of goals in life. I would recommend this job to anyone who could stand up for a long period of time, and someone who likes to stay busy."
good,Amazon is a great company to work for the only downfall is the schedule they offer. It gives employees great opportunities within the company. So overall I would rate amazon highly.
good,Amazon do have an great work ethic team . Amazon had helped me Grow as an individual. The job is very easy and very challenging but is definitely worth Your time .
good,"Amazon has a good and friendly staff who helpful with good vibes. I really enjoyed working there for seasonal part time, they treat there employees well. Its fast pace environment helps your shift go by quick and you get your daily workout while getting paid."
good,A typical day at work was going in having our group meetings with the team lead/ supervisor to amp us up to get ready for work. Plus our lunches were always nice to have so many people there to communicate with.
good,Amazon is a fun place to work because every day is an adventure. The management team is the coolest people around who allow you to be yourself and keep an open mind.
good,Amazon is a very nice place to work if you are a person who hates standing still all the time. The Coworkers are the best and will guide you through the way of working in an amazon FC. I would recommend it to anyone who can roll with the punches.
good,Just wish they had a central ops office closer to West Phoenix. I was offered the job at the only office they have in Arizona and it was just too far. 33 miles one way.
good,Un ottimo posto di lavoro dove i diritti dei lavoratori sono tenuti in considerazione. Un organizzazione del lavoro eccellente.
good,Good company but management is shady and the job is very demanding on production. Slot of the higher ups are promoted from within and tend to over do their jobs.
good,"One of the most surprising and exciting things at Amazon is the amount of ownership and responsibility given to employees. And, with hard work, and consistent display of the Amazon leadership principles, employees can earn the opportunity to work on cool projects and disruptive technologies that improve the lives of Amazon customers. "
good,"Ensuring high-quality customer experience, extensive customer obsession, elevating customer satisfaction while adhering to work process is the best experience learned from amazon. Customer satisfaction was the bloodline of the organization."
good,"Fast paced, great place to work. I like that there is the option to get more hours once you are able to show that you are a reliable worker. I am also able to take time off when needed with no issues."
good,"Place was great to work at. Great environment to work in. They were on a good time schedule, getting people out of the Warehouse and on the way to the routes"
good,"Personally it was a humbling experience. I found myself welcoming feelings of discomfort, because in return I gained a new perspective towards self-discipline. I look forward to outlasting you, Peak Season."
good,Good place to work for most part just don’t get time off tasks and make sure you hit your numbers and you will not have a problem there and make sure you have time to take off work or they will let you go
good,It was a great schedule I enjoyed workin there I was able to connect with different people. I loved that it was a fast paced work environment. I enjoyed the huddles that we had in the morning. the cafeteria was nice. I also won an Amazon gift card my first day there.
good,Idk what I’m supposed to say on the review it was fast pace and i varies of jobs .i wish I can go back but since I moved to Texas I’m trying do amazon flex
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon.com. I had the opportunity to work in several capacities, as Human Resources, Operations, and Learning departments a manager.  My growth and skillset was expanded in the 10 years I worked for Amazon.com."
good,Amazon is not for everyone it’s a very fast pace Environment and everything is based on rate which you can make easily if you are focused and are there to work lots of room for growth if you want to grow in the company
good,great place to work if you like wearhouse work laid back is a way but fast paste it was good for a foot in the door for wearhouse and it is good on the resume

good,The work is easy but fast-paced and of excellence in all ways! Great Company to work for! Managers are friendly and help train you for advancement! I would recommend to all my friends!
good,If was ok I just didn't like the way the hours was set up. If it could be a little closer to home. It's a great job with good benefits paid training. You have to have a fast pace to work in this facility.
good,"I had a great experience as a seasonal employee working for Amazon as a seasonal warehouse employee over the holiday season.  Everyone there was accommodating, hard working and willing to lend a hand.  The work load was intense, to be expected but rewarding and gave me a sense of fulfillment and a feeling of accomplishment at the end of my shift.  It's definitely a work hard play hard atmosphere and if you put the effort forth, you gain the rewards.  I would apply to the company again and love to be a part of their team!"
good,Good i enjoyed the job very much the people where great the hours a where good the pay was good as well the environment was safe people where hard working and easy to work with

good,"very large building (about 4 acre size... 3 story, getting around and understanding the work areas or zones was the most difficult for me, overall, great place to work"
good,I would work from home 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. My day would consists of helping people on the phone with issues. The hardest part of work was people who were against me and my job. The most enjoyable part of work was helping people and making their day.
good,Amazon is a great place to work. They provide lots of opportunity for advancement. They also push their employees to enhance their careers. Safety is a priority there.

good,"Employee friendly company that gives many benefits to their workers and tends to extract the best from them while maintaining a fun work environment. The main goal of Amazon is to work hard, have fun and make history. All the employees are treated equally and are allowed to share their opinions in the company's growth."

good,"They stick to their tag line which Work Hard, Have fun and Make History. The work culture is relaxed, you can move in your own pace but they are very tough when it comes to quality."
good,"Great job, good pace, constantly moving, very fun. Good group of managers at BNA5. The job was very enthusiastic everyday about working there. Would definitely work there again, if granted opportunity."
good,"Fast paced, competitive with my co-workers.  Needs a lot of strength and endurance since the nature of work is a little bit hard- be able to carry at least 25 lbs. of packages into its corresponding pallet location. A fast scanner so in order to  meet the required number of packages to be shipped out/day."
good,having fun while job in amazon lots of thing i have learn in amazon  and how to manage our team . when iam working with  amazon we hove do lots of fun in r&r and birthday party
good,"The training worked well, management was helpful and the pay was decent for the work done. It was easy to schedule work, and there were options available for schedule choices after training was completed."
good,"I want to back work because I'm understand this job in policy the Amazon job the important thing is that the amazon company has respected all the workers who are working. And it has also protected in the system that it had, like health safety abilite to understand the work also, the responsibles had to understand the way of speaking with  the workers .Amazon there is no question of race or color and language sex you also speak, there was considered all the same way I like working at Amazon."
good,Amazon is a great job with plenty of perks and benefits.  The only problems are the lack of hours with their flex up flex down schedule and the time it takes to become a permanent employee from a seasonal worker.
good,un'azienda splendida da cuoi ho imparato tanto. Peccato che si tratti sempre di contratti in occasione del picco natalizio.
good,I felt like I was welcomed into the operation and the fact that you could listen to music while you worked is a good high point for this company. I wish I could go back to work for this company
good,"This is a great place to work as the environment has been very positive and upbeat. The job gets done early, you can go home early. Sometimes you work late but not big deal."
good,Management was fantastic to start then new managers ruined the collaboration of the team I was on. At Amazon your job is as good as its team and if you are fortunate enough to have a great manager then you’ll love Amazon.
good,From sorting boxes to scanning them and putting them on pallets to ship them out to the customers. Work culture was fun and relaxing but was very serious around peak times I.e. Christmas time when we were required to pump out shipments
good,Le fait d'etre avec une equipe avec une bonne ambiance de travail et de l'entraide entre collegue qui fait que le travail est terminé a l'heure pour le bonheur de tous
good,"Long hours during the holidays with no time off during thanksgiving to xmas."
good,"For Seasonal Delivery Associates are typically 10 hour shifts & paid weekly. Orientation is two days in class room then a ride a long, this is a new position directly from Amazon itself, not from those contractors that rent the cargo Van's"
good,"easy  work !!!!!!"
good,"I had to learn to walk really fast and it was like a workout for me, if I ever had the chance to work for them again I would love to give it another try."
good,There is always something to do and can always make new friends there. If you do not like picking you can always throw large box trucks or make sure there is no jams.
good,Pay is great but workin night shift I had little tome to enjoy with my family and friends. Paid tine off every 2 weeks and vacation time every two weeks. Hardest part of the job is not getting TOT (tine off task).
good,"At the beginning of each shift, we started with a turnover meeting. Depending on how your zone did these and who was turning over to you determined its either high value or redundancy of the meeting.  The culture is great once you're in.  My troubleshooting skills have become top notch thanks to great field leads and our team's chemistry.  Each team and zone lead runs things differently and independent to the team yet cohesive to the zone.  They have some amazing managers; I was lucky to be with some of them and have them push me thoroughly.  Where some other leads are incredibly non-motivated it was confusing why they were managers at all, or it was a lead role they were pushed to."
good,"The company's atmosphere and surroundings in working field is great. work there you always feel friendly and warm with the people from every levels. that mean you don't feel uncomfortable when you are talking with a colleague you don't know, even he or she is your boss."
good,Great place to work but they owe you body and soul.  When you have to work  overtime  it is mandatory.   They have paid time off a d super  awesome  benefits.
good,"The training was very informative and went a long way for different learning styles. "
good,I think it a very fun a easy job. The train take 2 days but it only 3 hours long. Every shift is 4 hours at most 5. It great for a having a second job.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. Quick paced, but friendly and helpful staff and coworkers. A lot to learn if your willing to forgo the learning process and work hard."
good,Great benefits a little unorganized right now for a launch site but things will get better down the road.  Very fast paced and you are very independent working here !
good,I loved working at amazon the money is great and weekly pay its a good job if you just want to stack up thousands of dollars in a short period of time
good,"I found this job to be very good for me. It paid me well enough to move out on my own very comfortably, and I enjoyed my time there. The only real issue was with my specific shift. I worked the overnight weekend shifts, from 6pm to 6:30am Thursday through Saturday. It was only a 3 day week, getting 36 hours in that time, and made for a relaxing four days off that I really enjoyed having. However, since I found it easier to simply keep the overnight schedule during the week I found myself rather lonely most nights. Everyone I knew was asleep since I was maintaining the overnight schedule to make the work week easier. I could have simply corrected my sleep each week, but that was a headache I didn't want to deal with."
good,Amazon is a very fast paced place with advancement opportunities. The lunch are is large with gaming systems there for employees breaks and lunches. Management needs a little work but nothing huge
good,It's okay I like it. Management can be a mess sometimes but they work with you. I love my department. 13 hours can get a little tiring but it's only for 3 days.
good,"Easy to blend in and supportive management. "
good,"I live by Amazon. Number 1 shopping place. I would like to work here again for late afternoon, early evening hours. 2-3 evenings per week. 6pm-9pm or 6pm-10pm. No weekends."
good,"Overall, working for Amazon was a good experience. The calls are either 1. Angry people who haven't received their packages 2. Older people who don't understand the website or 3. People who want to cancel their subscriptions. Calls are back to back and there are blackout periods where you cannot miss work and have to do overtime (November-February) "
good,"A good way to start your career in high tech."
good,Amazon is a very fast paced and innovative company that will leave you mentally and physically challenged on a daily basis.  The speed at which we move is exemplified with our customer first approach.
good,Amazon should be more flexible with school hours. I love the exercises before and between work. Breaks should be extended do to us not being to have our phones. Management usually have a great attitude and is always smiling.
good,I never felt any kind of pressure working with this company.This company helped me to improve my working skills for supporting customers and we use to play volleyball sometimes
good,"bonne expérience "
good,"I wish they told us on call meant not able to convert. I also wish I could have a set schedule and be an actual associate, not part time or on call or flex"
good,Great work place  great benefits room for growth managers come and go. Great work life balance  hr around the clock amcare at amazon incase of injury.
good,"Fulfilling experience working here, got a scheduled work routine, well managed organization and processes,dynamic process workflow made it a great learning experience and gave me a better understanding of the operations and the various parts of the company and how they run independently and together"
good,"Pros: interesting work, good teammates, ability to change teams internally when you get bored. "
good,"Responsible for the supervision of day to day inbound, outbound, sort, and dispatch of 50,000 plus packages on a daily basis."
good,"I worked at one of their fulfillment center, TBH the working culture is good and disciplined. I worked with their hardware developer but most of time I had difficulties finding him and get any feedback from him. It is pretty good to work with his suballies tho"

good,"Great to Learn and Friendly Environment."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. It is a collaborative environment and it does not matter what role you are in. Even from corporate visits the higher managers viewed us as equals and valued our opinion.
good,Entreprise pleines de bonnes choses mais non réalisable pour ma part dommage
good,"Great place to work, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a job. A typical day is getting ready for work, logging into the system, because my position was virtual, going to the site where all of the other people who worked virtually and talking to them."
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon.   It was relatively easy work.  No drama and clear expectations. I wish I had been hired on Full time.   If you  like working this is the place for you
good,"quick and fast paced work, must be willing to lift heavy items and think quickly on your feet. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes because you'll be standing on your feet for long."
good,"Hard working standing for 10 hours, loved my job and people there."
good,"Just to keep it simple, it was always competitive.  I had learned something new almost everyday.  Each day I got better and better.  I was one of the top packers and was planning on applying for higher position. Though I took on another job which resulted in moving away but wouldn't mind working at Amazon again."
good,Amazon was a great place to work it was very relaxed and fun. We worked hard and met deadlines as a team. I like to work with other people to complete a common goal.
good,"Its good if you're hired as part time or full time, otherwise its not that great. The job itself is pretty easy. a good workout. My manager was not very involved but as i got to work with another one i realized it was only mine that sucked."
good,My position was always seasonal. It's fast paced hard work. Not enough time for your breaks because of walking distance to break areas. Positive atmosphere to work in. Good paid training. Overall a good company.
good,"Alles war sehr toll beim Amazon.Die arbeits atmosphere war sehr gut."
good,"Being a packer was a very rewarding experience, it was easy to do even while pregnant. All of my fellow employers were friendly and caring. I liked to watch my production numbers and try to beat them each day."
good,"Hard work, but not unreasonably so and good exercise for sure in a lot of roles."
good,"It's a very demanding job, but the benefits are excellent. Your work hard but can afford to play hard as well. It;s not for everybody the good time is you have great potential to grow,"
good,"Experienced very much comfortable workplace."
good,"I contratti dovrebbero essere di almeno 6 mesi,  per dare la possibilità eventualmente di aprire una disoccupazione al termine del fine contratto.. proprio perche il.mondo Amazon agevola il dipendente."
good,I really liked working for Amazon and would love to return there honestly. The benefits you receive apon hire are great and the management at my site was great. I miss that job.
good,"Never had any issues working at amazon everyone was super nice and accommodating.  Job was super easy to do nobody looking over your shoulder,  facility was clean and safe with perfect temperature."
good,"I would manage the overall Inbound dock."
good,"Great non micromanaged environment, pretty lacked as long as you are doing your job, it is some managers that aren't as lacked but its easy to avoid those"
good,I loved it because of the fast paced but the only issue that I have ever had while working there is when what happened I was told by the hr manager that I could get rehired after 90 days ok so it's been 6 years since then &  when I did apply recently I was told that I could not be rehired
good,Package handling and sorting in a fast paced warehouse environment. learned many jobs and worked 10 hours shifts over the holidays. not for people with no drive.
good,Really enjoyed my time at Amazon at customer receive management were extremely friendly and helpful. Good rate of pay and the hours of work were really good.
good,"They have video games, basketball, vending machines a snack bar. The work loads are a lot. But you find it interesting to look at all the different things people order. The fulfillment sent is huge so you are always meeting new people and being able to communicate with a lot of others."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at and for Amazon.com. "
good,"They are overly conscious about safety, to the point where sometimes it impedes your job. And is a very physical job.But they are very proactive about any health issues or concerns you may encounter in your job. But room for advancement is extremely limited."
good,"On your Break, you can play a litte basketball game or sit inside the break room. The work is fast at times but it is totally worth it. Everything just depoends on the volume for the day."
good,"I enjoy the fact that I can work  three twelves and that I am off four days. Very busy when the seasons change , but when there is no business then you are looking for for work to do. To work here there is a lot of walking only if you are on the dock. Very Simple for the most part. Managing the time that they give you to take off is a big deal , at the end it do all work out ."
good,Majority of management is young and have no professional respect for their job or professional verbal communication. Great pay and benefits though and a overall fun environment to work in.
good,My day at Amazon was very fast paced and busy. Lots of great friendly coworkers and staff. Employees safety was very important. Amazon gave me great experience
good,Meine Erfahrungen bei Amazon sind sehr gut ich hatte ein anständiges Gehalt sowie war auch das Arbeitsumfeld sehr gut.
good,I was only seasonal. It was a nice place to work. As long as everyone does there job the shift runs smoothly. Also the co workers love to help each other.
good,employee scanned products with 15min breaks between the different and many items that needed to be scanned over the course of the night.Supervisors watched over and walked the floor!
good,"I liked working at amazon, the management team was cool and fun but about there business. The best time to work there is during the holiday season. After that it gets slow."
good,"Il mio lavoro in Amazon nel reparto inbound è stata un`esperienza più che soddisfacente, avrei voluto continuare ma il contratto in somministrazione era solo per un mese e non mi è stato prorogato non per il mio operato ma per mancanza di volumi di lavoro in azienda (cosi mi è stato riferito dall`agenzia preposta).Resta il mio feedback positivo per il mio operato è questo mi lusinga perché credo di aver svolto bene il mio lavoro."
good,Work start early morning. Load van and start delivering. I learned a high standard of work. Need work hard. Amazon keep high standard. Management is good.
good,"I've been a packer a Amazon for about a month and a half. As I started just at the beginning of peak, it has been insanely busy. But to be perfectly honest, so far the horror stories I've heard about working at Amazon are completely unfounded. Yes, the work is fast paced and non-stop. Yes, the hours are long and the overtime sometimes seems never-ending."
good,It's good place to learn and enjoyable at the time of working. Smart workers are identified and do such wonderful appreciation by the time working.work hard.have fun.
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon fulfillment center very fast paced and hard at times but I enjoyed my time there . I will say that younger employees were treated more favorably than older employees , it is a very fast paced enviorment ."
good,"I have worked for amazon for about 6 months & I absolutely love it. My facility only offers part time shifts, if it had full time shift, I would DEFINITELY work for them full time with no issue."
good,I got let go due to the point system they have . I went to reapply for the full time warehouse but it’s was so much scrutiny behind what part- time managers would go there & other things of that matter that working for the full-time warehouse seemed like it was all based on who liked you versus who’s better for the job
good,Great company to work for. I just worked at the one building that treated their employees unfairly. I was terminated after having a confrontation with a lead who constantly harassed me. I filled a complaint and was never followed up with about this issue.
good,"I loved my job there. Just wish it would had been closer, because I would had never left. It was a great, fast paced, well respected work environment there. If coming home wouldn't had taken any longer than going to work I would had never left."
good,Great experience working at Amazon! Nice people. Good training on varieties of forklift ranging from dock stocker to cherry picker. Over all its a memorable adventure working at Amazon!!
good,"Amazon was a very good place to work. While there is a lot of walking and fast paced work, the environment is very friendly and no one will ever say no to helping you if you need. "
good,"Good place to work for if you need the money, keep in mind hours are long and you get two 30 minute breaks. Positions are easy but can get repetitive and tiresome over time, don’t forget to stretch."
good,"I work the overnight shift in receiving. They use metrics like productivity that can be hard to meet, but Amazon takes care of its employees with great benefits."
good,"Typical day, coming find a station, receive merchandise, prep, it and package send it on a conveyor. There a ton of counting, and sorting, can mess up quickly if not careful. Long standing hours, wear comfortable shoes."
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for. They offer so many opportunities, health and dental care. It's a hard job. Some people are lazy and thats why the complain about the company. But they really are good to their employees. We get 4 days on and 3 days off. We get paid and unpaid time off. During Christmas we make a lot of money, and they even do raffles every day so we can be shown how appreciated we are for the work we do. During Peak Season, they will hire a lot of people through the temp agency and if they see that you are doing well, Amazon will most likely offer you a full time job with their Company! It happens all the time. One thing I don't really like is that the rate is so high. You shouldn't have to worry about your job on the line every day because you didn't make the rate needed."
good,"It’s been an awesome experience working for Amazon. It was very challenging but once you get the feel of the way things work, you should quickly adapt to the workplace."
good,"The job was fun because it was a competitive. The managers made it fun because they weren't boring people, sometimes I didn't even feel like I was at work. The atmosphere was relaxed not at all negative."
good,Everyone was really nice and welcoming. Management was very helpful to motivate workers to be productive and staying positive. I would have stayed longer if this  job had been permanent.
good,"My time spent at Amazon was fun. My coworkers where awesome and my manager was outstanding. My position as a work from home CS Associate was seasonal so I didn't get to stay, but I would definitely go back."
good,"Great Experience , learn alot, highly knowlegable pepole, Great work culture. Had deep understanding of workflow. Easily accessible management. Would love to work with amazon"
good,"Good training but a very fast paced job and after a training period you have a quota to meet, which doesn't mean termination but is frowned upon. Holidays off but the work is HIGH in demand before and after."

good,Intense and Fun place to work. Enjoyable experience with solid mechanisms to grow.Intense and Fun place to work.leadership principles are ket to the company's success and alignment on company goals is critical for the individual's success.
good,"Pace was fine, managers were ok but seemed to lack people skills.  I was a manager in the Military so I know what I'm talking about.... this could account for high turnover rate.  People simply want to feel taken care of ...you will always get more work from a person who feels listened to and cared for.  I love to work.  I enjoyed the work.  I enjoyed the facility, the social aspect, meeting fellow workers and keeping pace with operations....near the end of the holiday season I did not feel challenged mentally,  no one picked up on that.  I felt ""under-utilized"" No big deal.  Still a great experience.  I mentored those under me and those above me.  I have no problem with that.  I still felt like I was part of a great team and that I helped the process.  Once again, a great experience overall."
good,"My experience was AWESOME!  I started during a Christmas season and at that time, we got free meals, bonus snacks, OT perks, gift cards and were just shown APPRECIATION.   I lost 32 lbs in a year of just walking and being on my feet for 10 hrs a shift and loved knowing that my friends and relatives were getting their orders correctly and fast!"
good,Amazon location YYZ2 in Brampton is a cool place to work it has all the advance features and extensive tools to cater your and future needs. I like the competitive  approach of the management to perform efficiently.
good,"Amazon is very good place to work i enjoyed alot there. I learned many things there like how to coporate with everyone or about time management. In amazon warehouse the environment is fact paced, friendly, and everyone is very helpful to each other."
good,"I loved the job, as a shy person I was able to step out of my shell and work with other people who I would have never imaged. I've made a lot of close friends while also learning the warehouse job."
good,It's a very hard job but the staff cooperate a lot and the people are very nice and have a lot opportunity for professional growth and also everyone is recognized for the good work
good,Productive and fun place to work for. Great for getting your foot in the door for such a large corporation. Food menu's change everyday you'll always be intrigued with what they have to offer.
good,The way that they encourage everyone to be in a team and have everyone work along and promote team growth allows the employees to perform their jobs efficiently and politely.

good,Very fast pace of you like competition . You have to meet your rate Which you can meet easily if you work at a very good pace. I like it here. Come join the team!
good,"Working at Amazon was a great first job. It allowed me to get a good 11 hour workout in everyday while I was a Runner. The hardest part was the long hours ,but that was also one of the best parts of the job."
good,"I did not understand that I had to resign to apply for a management position.  After inquiring about management positions, the people working as HR representatives, were not very helpful, once they ascertained that I had a degree.  I asked an Area Manager about a career path to management and he gave me pertinent information.  However, I got hurt on the Job and did not have enough time off to recuperate per off time hours."
good,Good place to work and lots of overtime. Good pay. Sometimes it's downtime but a lot of times you Stay busy. Wear comfy clothes and shoes as u will be on Thor feet a lot.
good,I loved my time there .I worked as a picker and packer and the job was easy to learn and do. I have worked for Amazon on a temporary basis on two different periods and i have seen some people starting with me and staying after i had left on a permanent basis.
good,"Nice boss, caring co workers. Very enjoyable to help make schedule and be a team player. Safety is always number one priority. I wish that I had more hours while working here."
good,"If you are socially capable and driven this is a great company to work for. There is a lot of opportunity for someone who plans on sticking around. It is often a crazy place to work as it is fast paced and VERY policy heavy. The benefits start day one and they are pretty decent. There's much incentive to do more such as raffles, events, etc. The ""standard work"" and policies that you must follow can seem a bit much at times but it's not difficult. Once you understand the culture and are knowledgeable in your role you can fly."
good,"Amazon is a great company to be employed with, Having access to huge resources. Its great to have a start up culture for such a big MNC. Employee-centric , Good Facility & Promising career."

good,What an awesome place to work I wish I could keep working here forever but family commitments caused otherwise. It is a privilege to be part of the amazon.de family and amazon worldwide community.
good,"I recommend it to people who are used to working a warehouse, or want to be their feet all the time I wouldn't recommend to people who don't like being physically active cause it's walking for a max 8 to 10 hours if your working a double shift "
good,"If you want to WORK HARD, have fun, and make history it's a great place to work. The work can be demanding and you will be expected to deliver results. The training is fast and you will be expected to keep up."
good,The best paying job and fine place to work at amazon is the most affordable job I could’ve  ever had and the people treat you with the upmost respect and kindness you could of ever asked for
good,a typical day at work is basically working at our own pac. we do have to meet a certain rate for the week. the hardest part about the job is making sure we dont mess up when it comes to stowing things in the wrong bin. the most enjoyable  part of the job is the breaks because we get to sit down. being on yor feet for 10-12 hrs a day sucks a lot. the management team is pretty good. they keep you updated for where you are for the week.
good,"I felt we were treated well, benefits were better than I expected. Hardest part was the freezer, though they provided us lots of gear and kept getting us new types of gloves etc (they really were trying)  my fingers would burn after about 20/30 minutes in the freezer- more pain than I could tolerate. Bonus was getting a lot stronger from all the lifting"
good,"Work place and environment is good."
good,"Depending on your location, it's a great place to work. There is room for growth if you are looking to move up in the company. I would go back if there was a position available."
good,"It was good to work, fun learning and was a knowledgeable experience "
good,"I very much enjoyed my job, other than the fact that they over staff the area I worked in and I need to be engaged at all times. I understand that it’s hard to eaten mate sales and how busy it may be but still."
good,You can sit and communicate with people from different places it's a laid back job and easily to get threw your day. People are friendly and management works with you on everything.
good,"great place to work for if you are a full time or part time employee, being temp was ok just no job security. after temp was over there was no place for me, had to find other job. work as AMCARE, was great experience."
good,"Very busy job, but most people were friendly, could get challenging at times during peak, but thats expected being its the busiest time of the  year for most companies."
good,Fast pace good communication is key at all times and helping customers with good policy for orders. We make sure to call orders in if there’s mistakes
good,"Love it, would love to go back but I loved all the time and people that helped me through my amazon career. It is hard work but they treat people well"
good,"Could have been better during the off season, they sent people home all the time and forced you too, they would find a way. During peak the hours and pay was great, however when it wasn't peak you were lucky to work 2-3 full days"
good,"Condensed schedule is a great benefit"
good,Amazon.com is a great place to work!  Very fast paste environment. Calls are taking 24 hours a day. Customers are very excited about shopping. Talking to new people is the best part of the job.
good,Work is fast-paced and fun. Good four hours of healthy exercise plus getting paid to sweat. Very good human resources department and fun games and giveaways for workers.
good,Moving boxes trying to work way up. Fun work environment no issues with anyone great job to work for entry-level workers. Easy for people who can manage a job standing around. Apply now.
good,Go through different managers almost every month. Competitive with rates but are rewarded. Also have great benefits and productivity is great depending who's manager
good,"I would recommend this employer to those who are trying to obtain employment."
good,Excellent part-time job opportunity to make extra money. Scheduling was easy and flexible through an app. I could decline any shifts and cancel shifts I already signed up to 45 minutes prior to start.
good,"Some managers talk to you like your children and the break is only 15 minutes for a 5 hour shift, overall I thought the job was easy and relaxed some of the time."
good,"loved working here, didnt want to leave but didnt have a choice, i would love to come back when im able to!!!!!   Amazon has great benefits, but needs to change the paid time and unpaid time off and give people more time off in case of emergencies. i believe as well as a lot of others that they do not allow you to have enough time off."
good,Amazon India was an excellent workplace. The office and culture was very good. My boss was friendly and helpful. The salary was low though and promotions take time.
good,"Hard in the fulfillment center. You are forever learning something new everyday. Management are helpful for the most part. Funny and wild. Very hard on the body. The people are great!!!!!!. more psychical work."
good,I worked in SAT1 and it was a pleasure to work there. The managers were great and the work was fun. I enjoyed going to work and the work that was done there. I only would have like for that location to be full time and not part time.
good,"At times the days seemed pretty long, but the pay was good and the break rooms were interesting, and fun. They have their own place to buy food, and everyone is usually fairly friendly. I'm happy to have learned what it was like to work there, packing, and helping with the quality of packages. The management was fine, and they were always concerned about the health and safety of their workers, to make sure that injuries and such were kept to a minimum. The workplace culture during work hours were usually fairly fast paced, and at times it was tedious, though the friendliness of my co-workers always made me able to keep up. The hardest part of the job was definitely the tedious, and long hours. The most enjoyable part was meeting all the new people I could, and the break rooms were a fairly fun place to be in."
good,"Amazon ist eine sehr gute Firma.Angenehmes Arbeiten ,nette Kollegen"
good,"Fun,fast pace environment where growth is encouraged. The management there is very effective and professional.If I had to say a con about this job it would be the short breaks but overall a great job."
good,"This is a great job for people who want to be challenged while working. There are daily goals that must be met and the management challenges you to improve your ""rates"" every day. The hours can be long and exhausting; plus working there doesn't leave much time for anything else. But the pay and the community of other warehouse workers can't be beat."
good,"Ho lavorato in Amazon per 8 mesi di notte e nel complesso sono rimasto soddisfatto. Lo stipendio è buono, probabilmente uno dei più elevati nel campo, ovviamente bisogna impegnarsi perché la concorrenza è tanta. L'unica ""pecca"" è la pausa molto breve ma, considerando che facevo la notte, riuscivo a bere un caffè e a fumare una sigaretta tranquillamente. Inoltre è retribuita. L'aspetto negativo è che è molto difficile ottenere un contratto a tempo indeterminato. Se mi richiamassero tornerei volentieri."
good,"easy days packing.exciting days as a problem solver"
good,"It is usually a very carefree environment. But after a while, it takes it toll on your back or your knees. I recommend this to anyone I know who is looking for a good part-time job."
good,"Must be on time and work right up to breaks, lunch, and clock out time. I took all opportunities to learn everything I was offered, including kickouts."
good,"Amazon logistics center is the best place I have worked at so far. It is extremely difficult to transfer between locations and advancing is near impossible with the ratio of associates to open higher level positions. Very fun, upbeat place. Everyone is friendly. All positions are easy and fast paced."
good,"Amazon is fast paced and very customer centric. It adheres to the 14 Leaderahip Principles. Teams work to ensure that the customer is always comes first.  "
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work, calls mainly consist of orders not being delivered on time.   Many of the customers are very enjoyable to talk to.  Management is very helpful wherher you are on their team or not.  The hardest part of the job for me was sitting on hold long periods of time waiting for shipping companies to answer."
good,Everyone who worked was super friendly. The staff all cared for each individual and worked well with everyone. Hard work but they used good time management. Training showed you exactly what to expect in job.
good,i enjoyed the work its fast paced not to much outside work talk but thats great for me mixed culture they should have longer breaks it was a easy process i went threw a temperary agency im up for re hire
good,"Muy buena empresa para las personas con su primer trabajo, amplios espacios, genial ambiente de trabajo y en general una muy buena empresa"
good,"This by far is my favorite job. I worked the overnight shift so things were more relaxed than the other shifts. It was very easy, the job is just scanning and stacking packages for a few hours. Unfortunately that means little job security since a 5 year old can probably do the job with ease.The hardest part of this job was team work, this job requires A LOT of it (it can be between 50-300 people on a shift) and some people are not team players. I would definitely recommend this job to everyone and if you can try to work the night shift, working a different shift is almost like working in a completely different environment/job so your experience may be different."
good,its not hard because u get training but it is continuous work fro 10 hours you get two 15 minute paid breaks and a 30 minute lunch break. the people are the only thing that's really annoying about the job because some people want to play roles their not qualified for nor shuld they take on.
good,Overall you really have to work hard and want to excel in order to move up in management and there are plenty of leaderships to guide you to the next step and will work with you as well as continually follow up until you've secured your desired position.
good,"Everyday started with exercises, the work is easy and no hindrances "
good,"Was great sometime slow and friendly people. I would love to work for amazon.Com again if they have one where I live in dayton, ohio. The company is to far to travel."
good,"hardest job and a lot of competition due to timing of scanning. However, a lot of team work, fast paced and sometimes we finish on time or less work if no volume."
good,"It was friendly environment.  I had so much fun"
good,"Tous le monde vous met à l'aise, vous aide quand sa ne va pas, vous dit ce qui est bien et pas bien, ce qu'il faut amélioré ou non ....."
good,"It's a great company but trying to get hours is hard.  "
good,"Management needs to improved.Apart from that all looks good and easy to work. "
good,Loved my job. The benefits were amazing. I would recommend this place to work to anyone looking. The work environment was a very laid back and fun loving environment. There were dress up days as well....they made going to work enjoyable and fun. The job wasnt hard at all unless you juat didnt like to work.  I moved up to be an ambassador and train new employees quickly due to my production.
good,"Innovative and exemplary leadership ability with the drive to motivate and assist others. Adept at analyzing, conducting research, develop continuous process improvements and incorporate business process initiatives to increase efficiency. Implementing price match strategies and improved market penetration through development, deployment and integration of strategic vendor initiatives and negotiate effectively with vendors to establish joint goals and improve pricing structure."
good,"Very Enjoyable Job!"
good,The work is easy and easy to learn. Everybody works together and helps one another. There are some situation that are hard to find a solution but just ask for help and someone will help.
good,"It was a good place to work. At first it is hard to adjust to the fast-paced environment, however after few months it is becoming easier. Also, salaries are definitely great comparing to the most of other warehouses."
good,"I worked with other employees to pick products off the shelves in different ales on a timed base. I also did packing and shipping. The packing required labeling on each box for shipping and putting the product in the box with bubble rap/paper, taping the box then ready to ship. For shipping we would load the semi's/trucks with the packages to be sent out. The people there were very caring and good to the employees. They feed us daily served drinks and had vending. the hardest part of the job was shipping because the boxes could become very heavy. My favorite part of the job was packing the products in the boxes and labeling the boxes.  It was something I loved doing."
good,"Fun but tiring place to work at.  There is a few different thing to there between inbound, outbound and scanning. The work is enjoyable but can become repetitive."
good,"When you work at Amazon you will love every second of it the managers are cool the pay is great and the work isn't hard to do. When you come into the building you need to clock in with your id, at the facility i worked in the had games televisions and free hot coco. They even do raffles."
good,"Amazon retail is still new to the retail scene as far as physical"
good,"Productive, fast-paced,and I like the work it's just very hard to advance it seems and after the initial raise after training, I do not think there are anymore raises available,which isn't good."
good,"All rules and expectations were clearly defined and management kept positive energies. "
good,"Amazon is good for overnight hours. Good with communicating with employes, giving directions, we strech before work, and give a pep talk. Nice pace. Recomend"
good,its ok it's not the best place for older people looking to advance i think its who you know not what you know and when it comes to an older person they will overlook you to a younger lesser qualified person
good,great company. you get to choose your shifts at your own leisure. very flexible hours. Different warehouses around the area to choose from. great opportunity to meet knew people.
good,"Definitely would work there again... and go permanent! Maintenance is a lot different from many positions there, but great environment and good pay..."
good,Fast pace environment and constant learning. Amazon provides you with the opportunity to create new ideas that will benefit the company in all its endeavors.
good,Amazon was a great stepping stone for me on my road to management. I started out as a temp employee then shortly after I was hired on through the company as Ambassador where I was able to train new employees.
good,"I Love Working At Amazon "
good,Good workplace. Amazon provide fix hours and days of work. People can do overtime work as they needed. Management is very friendly and treat everyone equally.
good,amazon is a great place to work!!! need 20 minute break instead of 15 but that's my only issue.. I LOVE AMAZON!! hardest part if you are a picker is the walking but peak is worth it for sure.. The really take care of you and once a week the feed you subway or pizza
good,"I love working for Amazon. The customers love Amazon, which makes the calls so much easier to handle to completion. Each call is different. "
good,"If you are looking for a fast pace job this is the place for you... If you aren't then don't waste their time applying.. They have great benefits for employees and discounts.. Plus once you become full time you also get more benefits like stocks, etc... It is a great place to work for and every building is different"
good,"It was a great experience, I loved working with my team and they were very supportive with everything. I would recommend this company to anyone who is willing to work and learn."
good,Its all about teamwork. The environmemt is ok. The managers are excellent. You can get benefits and you do get sick time. So that you can take off and still get paid. Paid weekly as well.
good,"The complete life of an employee totally depends on his/her manager so if the manager is good, employee can really perform and explore a lot. The CEO icelles really excellent"
good,"Great learning experience. Working with enterprise level vendors challenge you to be on point at all time. Love the atmosphere. Everyone was just as excited to get their work done, and done right!"
good,The pace is fast but the work in routine. Little time to socialize during work shifts. But everyone is treated fairly and the pay is good for the type of work and skill needed
good,My only complaint would be expanding there range for keeping employees that go that extra mile to work. I loved the work environment and my co-workers were great. Even though it was a seasonal job I gained a lot of experience while working there.
good,Amazon is a cool place to work which provides you intense training and support and helps you in grasping things at your own pace. They also have dedicated fun team to keep you entertained. The work style is pretty free and you will not feel much pressure If you are able to sustain with your performance
good,"If you're looking for a part-time job, this is a really good choice. After you complete your fixed training days, they are very flexible with your schedule. You can pick how many hours you work a week or a month. It's up to you what days and what time slot you want to come in. Also, there is a lot of help if you have questions, but you're pretty much on your own completing orders."
good,"Amazon was a great place to meet new people from all walks of life.  At amazon there are a variety of ways of doing things in order to get the job done. However, the many  people there used the variety so being flexible and adaptable was Key trait in order to keep up with the seasoned veterans. Fast paced and hardworking is what I saw when working at Amazon. Of course there were nay sayers and complainers but the beauty of amazon was that if there was a problem it was solved on the spot to prevent further negativity in all shifts year round. Being positive and having a smile was part of the Amazon life."
good,"Amazon.com is a company that provides its employees the opportunity to take what they can get out of it and build a life for themselves. It's hard work and the days are long, but the pay and benefits are worth it."
good,It was either really busy or really slow sometimes employees got sent home early. Typical day consisted of pre shift meeting and then checking white board for job assignment.
good,"Mi sono trovato benissimo e ci tornerei subito, ottimo ambiente"
good,"They have many break rooms , Free coffee , and popcorn . Air hockey table , ping pong table And a Wii . They also have a shuffle board , a track , workout equipment. The hardest part of the job is taking the same kind of calls day in and day out . Although , other jobs in different departments do become Avail . Amazon is all about change . Fast pace ."
good,"Lavorando ad Amazon mi sono trovata bene,tutto ben organizzato, le persone che ti seguono sono molto gentili e sempre presenti"

good,It was a good place to work and grow in your career. I will recommend any person who is focused and pays attention to details to work at amazon.The wages are good and the management is well discipline
good,"When everyday is a hectic day but the employees helps bring the days objectives together. The best temporary job experience I have had in a long time and grateful for the opportunity. I learned that we still have to represent Amazon's name inside and out of Amazon Books and you have to be aware of your surrounds so every customer is taken cared of. Also, you are surround by books and fun knick-knacks all day, who wouldn't love that. Sometime, during the slow periods, there isn't much work to be done besides straighten out the book shelves so, those were the most painful times during shifts."
good,I had a lot of fun working there. The management is very helpful and is always willing to explain in depth processes that you do not understand. They make you feel very safe and confident learning how to drive a forklift.
good,"I would recommend anyone to apply for Amazon. Whether it be full time or part time. During peak season, plenty of overtime. If hardships come up, they work with you."
good,"Good job if you like hard work, long hours but there are also a lot of time available if you want time off. Good teamwork though and management are good ."
good,"Im working in England, "
good,"After the initial getting over my feet hurting, I found Integrity Staffing (Amazon) to be a great place to work at. The people were always nice and helpful. I really wish I could've stayed."
good,"Sortation associate position:"
good,Always very lively and happy through out hole shift. Everybody worked well together and alone could feel the good energy flowing through the warehouse.. I learned how to physically move heavy objects and keep balanced. It was hard to leave at the end of the day but was nice to no wasn’t to long until you was going back.
good,"Typical day at work involves supporting the customer (operations) with any HVAC/electrical issues they have, meeting with vendors and other teams like construction, safety and commissioning, figuring out ways to improve and optimize the designs of the data centers. I have learned a lot about air side HVAC systems, working with the AHJs and utility companies and electrical power distribution/generation systems. The management culture is not very stable, the likelihood of management changes over the course of a year is high. The work culture is average. The most difficult thing about the job is dealing with the constantly changing processes. The thing i like best is taking on new challenges and projects which allow me to learn more about data center design."
good,Ho travato un ambiente lavorativo molto stimolante con elevati standard di sicurezza per il personale impiegato .
good,"Its a good place to work. management and staff are all friendly."
good,The fast pace of the job was challenging.  So was working in the freezer room in freezing temperatures.  Management treated us fairly and I enjoyed the experience of working in a warehouse environment.
good,"*Always got something new to learn."
good,Learned alot in a short time had a grea time training with very friendly person. enjoyed the paychecks very competive pay rate was able to work long hours walking up to 15 miles a day

good,"Amazon made everyone feel as comfortable as possible in which they worked with all levels of capabilities of each person. They made sure to make the environment as fun as possible and before you began each shift with a team talks and stretches, which I did appreciate."
good,The facility is very clean and the management team is friendly. They have a lot of work incentives that motivate their employees. They also have a strong work ethic for their employee. Their goal is to always please their customers with on-time delivery and making sure their vendors can provide for their customers as well.
good,If you don't mind fast paced places to work with lots of changes this is the place for you. The culture and acceptance of everyone is fantastic and the managers really care about the teams they manage.
good,A typical day at work at amazon was busy but successful.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon. My co-workers were outgoing and easy to get along with. The job was by far the easiest job I've ever came across. The environment is fast paced, which I love and there is always work to be done."
good,"Amazon is a peculiar place to work, but being a massive corporation with ventures in a variety of spaces, it offers ample opportunities to learn and grow.  Being so massive and varied, experiences in Amazon.com can vary greatly between different teams, roles, and levels.  One of the valuable common threads is the sense of bottom-up ownership, with individual contributors empowered to take the actions they need to deliver."
good,"I'm suresh"
good,grandissima azienda organizzata  unico difetto orario notturno poi per il resto lavoro da magazziniere molto impegnativo
good,"Fast pace and always kept busy, good atmosphere and "
good,stow products coming in from vendors and other Amazon locations.

good,La parte più piacevo del mio lavoro  e che  si lavora   Di squadra
good,"Amazon ad oggi è l esperienza lavorativa più completa che ho avuto dal punto di vista professionale per il tipo di formazione ricevuto e dal punto di vista umano per i rapporti instaurati con i colleghi ."
good,More time for learn the jobs because not everybody learn at the same time and it’s a little bit more difficult for other people. And more time for breaks.
good,"Easy going environment with no dress code. Mindnumbingly boring work, but a nice little part-time gig. Not many opportunities for advancement and you'll definitely feel like a number. Some weirdos and slackers but you can find that anywhere."
good,Great company to work for. Amazon is fast paced and challenges workers mentally and physically to provide for their customers. Amazing benefits and compensation.

good,The products are good in Amazon.com and the experience products are perches the any where in India so the product are excellent in any where in India.
good,excellent place to workand meet new people. Good management and fair pay. Its fast paced but not to over bearing. Management tries to get to know each individual even though there's hundreds of other associates
good,"*Many shift options "
good,"It was a great experience ,dealing witht the customers and understandung their requirements. This gave us in depth knowledge of a customer reacts to his or her orders and how to retain a customer by applying problem solving skills"
good,"Great place to work. Management is good, and the pay is very competitive. I highly recommend working here at Amazon, and I do not intend to leave due to any work-related reasons."
good,Your experience at Amazon depends entirely on you. You are responsible for your own development. While you will meet a lot of people throughout the organization who will help you it is an extremely competitive environment.
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon and would go return again.  Work days are organized and predictable with great flexibility.  The Management team was awesome.  The people in general had good attitudes.
good,"A typical work day was a 10 hour shift: Start with the daily announcements while stretching. Receive a motivational quote. Go to assigned job. Later, 15 minute break. Back to work. Then 30 minute lunch. Return for another stretching session and more announcements. Back to work with the second motivational quote. Lastly the final 15 minute break, before the last round of work, clean up, and the clock out."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon very much. Managers were helpful and friendly. My fellow associates were extremely nice. Amazon always had fun stuff games and stuff to look forward to. Whether it was Amazon bucks, fun games that included the managers or prize giveaways. If you enjoy being constantly busy and moving non stop then Amazon is the place to work."
good,i loved working there and i want to go back as soon as possible. i want to work for the company. i would highly reccomend this job to anyone that is interested
good,It was amazing to witness the pace at which Amazon is growing.The work environment is extremely engaging and competitive. If you are looking to learn this is the place to be.
good,"Working at Amazon generally is fun. Each day comes with its challenges. I had a variety of roles which I liked. At times, it can be either dull or stressful, depends on which area you're working for that day. Co-associates were nice. Nobody really was negative or hurtful. I enjoyed pushing myself during those times when there was a lot of boxes/packages coming in and it made me feel good about myself that I was able to push on through and give all my best. Although, sometimes I felt like the shift would go on forever nevertheless, overall I had a good time."
good,"Fast paced environment where everyone gets along."
good,"Amazon is a great experience to have. In Amazon it is a very energetic culture. The people are concerned with being on time, completing their jobs, moving up the job ladder and directing others. Amazonian's will tell with openness that it is a great place to start a new job. But some of the Amazonian's do progress more than others. I am a thinker that likes to find ways of getting a job done. But the hardest challenges in Amazon is the employees who slacks their work and leave their portion of work duties up to everyone else to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is you can be yourself and there is support all around the building."
good,Fast Paced work environment. Easy to learn the job. Hardest part is sometimes meeting the quotas set in place based off of the amount of workflow. Management has very much an open door policy. would recommend people to work for them
good,"Great company. Great culture. Awesome growth opportunities and benefits. "
good,"the job is very fast-paced, it requires you to be on your feet all day every day of your shift. Its very demanding depending on hat department your are in."
good,If i had the chance to work there i would. My experience there is that i would recommend anybody to work there. Your able sometimes to choose in what position you want to work in
good,Good management and good appreciate manager.good.As an Amazon employee good timings and good shift weekdays. working.and we get a good family weekend and vacation.
good,"The work there was pretty simple inspect and scan the right products, get your numbers and be a proficient employee. There is always an opportunity to grow as a member for the corporation."
good,Learn quickly or this job is not for you. Loved the company but definitely wish I went to a different location with more diverse employees. But overall I love the Amazon culture.
good,"Great place to work "
good,"This is by far the easiest  job I have ever had in my entire life. Sorters have a chance to learn a variety of “sorting” task so it’s not the same everyday. However, this requires initiative on the part of the employee. Therefore , if you have a great work ethic and desire to learn it’s super easy and you won’t get complacent. Just ask a manager if you could try a new task and they will make it happen. This is a part time job for me. I work full time elsewhere and make a decent 70k salary. Therefore my complaints a"
good,When I worked at Amazon I had to make sure to work fast and be productive. It is a fun environment to work in and the managers are nice. Make sure to work hard and be fast.
good,"I would definitely recommend Amazon as a place to work, it was a great experience as an intern and you get a ton of new experience on the job. Although it does vary by team, I would say that there is something new you will always learn with Amazon."
good,Competitive compensation and unbeatable benefits. Typical schedule is 4 10-hour days per week. Holiday pay and paid vacation as well as unpaid days off.
good,It is a decent job if you can stay to yourself and get the task at hand done effeciently. You dont have to talk to anyone you come in contact with except for your managers every once in a while.
good,"Its nice because u work as a team and as an individual"
good,"I have had the pleasure of working in Amazon for 2+ years. It was my first job and an amazing experience! There is always some thing new to learn, and the co workers are super friendly and encouraging! :)"
good,If you are looking for a fast paced environment with lots of opportunity for personal and career growth then take a look at working for Amazon. The pros were that the benefits and time off are great and you only work 4 days a week at the Operations level.
good,"great place to work at, one of the best places ive worked at. a typical day there is go to your managers and see were you would be stationed and would either stock, stow, or replenish boxes for other workers."
good,"it was good job, you will do alot of walking so make sure you are in shape and looking to get in shape. not a bad enviroment just like any other job its what u make it to be"
good,"This place is definitely not for the faint of heart, you have to be a go-getter to maintain at a place like this. Very fast pace, as well as a 11 hour work-days but the pay is beyond worth it."
good,"I met some good people. It's a good place to work. Security is impressive. I had a problem with my employee password on the web. I never could get in the website, but managed ok."
good,"fun, good place to work, good managers education programs are ok, I would recommend to anyone looking for employment,. Peaktime you work extra hours ivertime required, the checks look good for christmas and new years"
good,"Although the job has long hours, most of the time full time workers only work four times a week. A typical day can become very monotonous, however the upside for an introvert individual  is not dealing with physical customers. The most enjoyable aspect of amazon is the co workers and management."
good,"It was a good company to work for, but the agency I worked for wasnt so good lack of communication! Amazon was amazing to work for and I enjoyed going to my work."
good,Working with the scanners can be hard because it's like a first come first serve. if you want a certain one you have to move fast to get iit. they stick on phones and making sure you scan every box you touch. no moving really slow have to work as a team. plus you get paid weekly.
good,"Working at Amazon was a fun experience. The managers were kind and polite treated every employee with due respect. The work can be challenging depending only the apartment you're working in,"
good,"You are labor tracked so not for the ones who do the bare minimum to get through. It its a competitive and fun place to work, there are many departments and each is different, one easier than the next on another harder than the next. Amazon also gives you many time off options as well as a great benefit package."
good,all in all it's a good place to work.  there are pros and cons at every job.  when production is busy it's great!  When work is slow it can get very boring and drag on.
good,The thing that got me the most and what eventually lead to me quitting was minimal amounts of interaction. Because there is no music and you cannot bring any personal devices inside the building you'd easily go for hours on end just sitting inside your own mind trying to find yourself a way to keep yourself from going insane.
good,Just be prepared to stand for long hours moving at a fast pace with very little break time. The pay is great and so are the benefits. And also have a reliable transportation.
good,pretty good work place just stayed focused pretty easy. room for job advancement and cross training. great benefits once hired directly through amazon
good,"la empresa esta muy organizada, me gusto mucho el ambiente"
good,"Quick pace environment, must be willing to handle your fair share of the responsibilities.  No room for slacking and delegating your duties to others."
good,Great work environment.  All employees on shift have a stand up meeting to get an idea of what the days work will be like.  All employees do body stretches so that while they are doing there job they will hopefully not get hurt. After meeting and getting our nightly work assignments everyone heads to there area.  All works were to check there area to make sure all related work equipment is at the station.  Works log into the work station and start to process they items that are coming down the line.  Process counties for a 10 to 12 hr shift depending on work load for the company.  The hardest part of the job for me was having to stand in one spot for so long.  Most enjoyable part of the every day job for me was the people I got to work with and getting to see the items that customers would return.
good,Very fast paced work environment. Must keep up with a work quota everyday. reasonable work hours and pay. If work quota was not met then the supervisor would speak with you.
good,I work at the sorting center and I love it. They are very flexible and pay well. I only work 4 sometimes 5 hours a day and I am also a full-time college. So I still have time to do my school work.
good,"In Amazon I worked very hard, labor conditions were good, I learned to handle scanners, in other way, the manager was demanding, the hardest part of labor was to pick womenswear, the most I like was the enviroment of wok and the pay"
good,I liked working for amazon though it was fast paced but it didn't feel like it was. I had a relaxed feeling about it. It was more my style I guess but I liked it especially the salary.
good,After a few days working here it honestly tiring but than as the days go buy you get used to it. Also the lunch area is almost like high school you sit with the people you know and depending on what department you're in you have lunch 1st or 2nd.
good,When i was their I had so much fun but i just wished I never stopped going because I had so much fun.The people that i worked with i had fun with and I really didn't know anybody their but everybody was friendly to me.
good,"Enjoyed working here,high energy,friendly environment fair salary,only one complaint when no work long 2 hour dinner. Always some giveaways and surprise almost every week"
good,"Excelente empresa, ambiente de trabajo excelente, motivación, procesos fáciles de entender"
good,"fast paced working environment"
good,"Great place to work, and expand your career experience. Clean environment and always at a respectable noise level. Fellow employee's are friendly. And there is an unlimited supply of coffee."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work and it saddens me sometimes to hear people disparage the company. It is fast paced and Amazon is full of owners that do work long hours...by choice. However, it is also a place that embodies the ability to find work/life harmony if you choose depending on what that means to you specifically. I have learned an immense amount about myself and where I want my career to go working there and have been surrounded by some of the brightest and more remarkable minds along the way. Not all teams are perfect and there may be some challenges along the way for some teams, especially as they deal with management changeover and incredible growth. But overall the company is amazing and the people therein are the industry's best."
good,job security is the biggest issue if you're not careful you can get fired for any reason. but the pay decent you gotta love to walk 10 plus miles a day
good,"1. One of the fortune 100 companies around the globe"
good,"Great place to work,fun and good hours and good money.I loved working here for many reasons, management was amazing,wages were great,overtime helped my family so much and we'll I loved the work!"
good,"Working at amazon was great , the coworkers was great and the management was outstanding . I moved up  expeditiously in the Amazon warehouse and it was very easy"
good,"I really enjoyed myself working at Amazon great company to work for"
good,"Believes in working hard, having fun, and making history."
good,A good place to work. Need a little improvement on those write ups. But overall a good place to work. Just give give regular days off. Two weeks paid vacation and then let each person accrue there time as they work. Give sick days personal time off at the beginning.
good,"It was a nice place to work with lots of different cultures. The only thing I didn't like was the call off procedure. The process was if you worked a certain shift and you need the time off for whatever reason, you were not able to switch a shift with someone so you had no choice but to call off if you had to."
good,It was a really an amazing place to work . Learned a lot there and felt really good at the end everyday having done something new or learnt something new . There was work satisfaction . We are given opportunities to explore ourself and new things there . I enjoyed that a lot since I love to learn to do new and different things .
good,"Typical days at Amazon would be coming into work check the pack board to see where they have you for that shift. The things I learned at amazon were being a team player, going above and beyond in whatever function they had me. Was always willing to learn new jobs. After my 6 months of being their I was able to apply for the ambassador role which included training new hired for the process they were placed. Management wasn't always on point, but with help and opinions from employees changes were made and improved. Workplace in general was a great experience. Everyone was willing to help one another to succeed. The hardest part of the job was the continues repitition and being rotated to different functions."
good,I loved working for Amazon! Fun and very fast pace job. Co-workers are a fun bunch of people. Everyday there are challenges to win Amazon gift cards or electronics.
good,Amazing is an amazing company. You will learn to find your true calling and you will get all the support you need ti grow into the best person you are able to become.
good,I was able to move up quickly with this company.  Benefits are exemplary in my opinion.  Would work here again.  Most managers have too many associates to actually work with them one on one but this is due to sheer volume of operations and not the actual managers fault.
good,"I been with amazon going on three years now, and i love working for this company and its alot of job advancement and fun environment to work in. Moved up with my first year and alot of different options to go to within the company."
good,"Empresa com cultura própria muito marcante, voltada ao resultado e muito bem organizada."
good,I was hired as a seasonal worker it actually best company I ever work for breaks on time over time management excellent very understanding stay busy though but nothing bad to say
good,Always something to do. It is great you dont get bored. I love working for amazon. There is great employee moral over all. If you can make it to work on time you will ensure yourself job stability.
good,"Very fast paced and they expect a lot out of their employees"
good,"Best work place so far."
good,"Working at amazon was amazing, I love the fast pace . There willing to help you and see you succeed, being able to meet all of the great managers and knowing that they want to see you move up is awesome."
good,Great and relaxed work environment with daily duties and changes in workflow.  Fair compensation and flexible work environment.  Management focuses on customer satisfaction and employee retention.
good,"Learn to work with the slam machine and robots ."
good,I was happy to be apart of amazon the benefits was very good  and the pay was good as well would love to have stayed the was having medical problem jods
good,I really enjoyed the time i spent at Amazon but they weren't willing to work with my school schedule so that forced me to have to leave. Amazon has great pay and great hours but for students they don't seem to be too flexible.
good,I started working for Amazon under the impression that I would not get fired for something so stupid but friends turn on you and you get fired but it's a fun place to work and good people to work with I loved all my co-workers but they take thing to serious
good,"Good workplace, great compensation as to benefits . fun employee environment. Hardest part of the job is making sure to always hit rate. Hitting rate can be hard sometimes you have to stay motivated. but overall a pretty easy place to be."
good,"Amazon is one of thee best companies you can work for. The benefits and job culture are unmatched. Management was super relaxed but goal oriented. Bonuses, opportunity for advancement, and college reimbursement are just a few of the reasons to apply."
good,The Amazon warehouse is a very product and organized workplace.they provide their staff with fun activities such as raffles and drawings from time to time.
good,"this is a fast paced, youth oriented work place, where, if you are motivated and a thinker, you can climb the ladder fairly quickly. I feel that the work is fair, not difficult, and that Amazon does not request that you work outside of your capabilities. Anyone that applies themselves can easily achieve the rate that is requested of them."
good,"The work is simple, the processes to make one at amazon successful requires very little skill or talent. Hard work, consistency, and safe work habits results in productivity. The managers are good some better than others. Some work right along side you to help meet goals, all the while maintaining a positive attitude throughout the shift. The associates become family depending on the environment of the OM and AM. Hardest part of the job for me is that the work is not challenging at this point in my tenure."
good,"Very great place to work. Management really needs to be worked on, they are extremely unprofessional and retaliate against associates alot. Other than that, just great to work there. Benefits are good, you are able to gain lots of experience there."
good,"Its a nice environment to work and safety is excellent.staffs and management are cool.the location,ethics are also great.everything there is commendable."
good,"peaceful environment and everybody work at their own pace. I feel this job for people with no real responsibility such as rent, car note, cable bill...etc."
good,"The good thing about working at amazon is that althought its alittle hard and the hours are long, its very rewarding. The work isnt too complicated and there are always opportunities to learn new skills"
good,"i learne, d safety is number one.  be a team player, wrapping pallets, forklift pallets to designated area/loading dock. alot of standing and running around"
good,"Everyday is different from an other days you can either be in the trucks unloading (inbound), closing pallets & wrapping them up (water-spider) etc the hardest part about there is working doubles not knowing if we'll flex up an hour cutting time for our next shift with relaxing or eating. The more enjoyable part of work has to be communicating with a diverse group of people. The management keeps everything in line."
good,"They hire everybody,no interview,but drug test.Work is simple-you catch it immediately.You have to have some rates,but if you cant do it they help.Nobody is getting fired.Sometimes there is pizza,but really rare.Coworkers are nice and helpful.Problem solvers , most of them, are very nice.Management is  also respectful,always ready to listen and help.At the beginning you are picker,then you learn how to stow,count ,running.Anybody with any education can do it.In a future if you want you can learn how to be a problem solver.Break is only 1, it is 15 min.You cant go outside.They dont have lockers for your bag and coat-you leave it on a hanger and your bag in open shelf.What they have is only small tiny lockers for your phone or money.But this you can take inside,no problem.There are coolers,coffee machine,microwave,refrigerator,TV,games."
good,"Ero sul turno serale, iniziavamo intorno alle 22 per finire di solito per le 06.30, di solito per il fatto che c'erano delle volte quando il volume era più del solito e finivamo più tardi, facendo più di  8 ore normali."
good,"Best Place to work the work atmosphere here will automatically boost you to achieve more numbers "
good,"very good company to work for very friendly staff and managers and just generally good places tp work, everyone Ian treated the same and everyone gets alone nice"
good,"Amazon is a tough place to work at.  It isn't for everyone.  It is a constantly relentless environment that will either work for you or not.  I'm a 2 timer at Amazon and can't say that I won't go back for a 3rd time.  There are so many folks like me who once they leave Amazon find every other company lacking -- lacking in their passion for customers, lacking in their focus, lacking in their discipline, and lacking in their professionalism.  I know dozens of people who have worked there 2-3 times.  Sometimes 9 months at a time, sometimes 2 years at a stretch.  "
good,"I would recommend it... Its not bad once you get use to it. "
good,"it was a temp job and seems its that way unless you have at least a associates degree. It was very physical labor job but i enjoyed it. my legs got a great workout to say the least as a picker. i learned how to use a forklift and even though i was afraid the trainers there were always funny and understanding. "
good,We trained for eight hours a day. Watching videos and taking tests on what we learned. Assisted customers with purchases and correcting mistakes made on their orders. I loved it. The schedule eventually conflicted with school and I had to leave.
good,It's actually a pretty great place to work if you have a good work ethic. If you don't it gets boring because the jobs tend to be really repetitive. Overall a great place to work and it is an easy job.
good,"It was great experience . I work for ship and receive. There a lot people you have to be comfortable with noise people , fast  . I'm good at it  . You learn a lot stuff about people order , pack , meet new people"
good,"I have worked at Amazon for an year. I would neither judge it as good or bad ,for it all depends on your preference. The answers here , both positive and negative , present you the work environment and its culture. Having nothing to add on that front , I would like to show you how the inherent culture changes you as a person beyond your work and intrudes into your character , taking you over slowly from within."
good,Was hired just for a contract period. Work culture is good and its a stress free work environment to work with. Company provides all kinds of facilities for its employees.
good,"You don't really have to talk to anyone so long as you can do your job.  It's very draining though.  "
good,"All in a all, a great place to work and showcase your skills. Work life balance is little off as everybody around you will be workaholics. But excellent learning experience!"
good,"This is a good company to work for, great benefits, good people. Workload is strenuous but not too bad. They are very flexible and understand to time off. Amazon also has a good disciplinary system, I enjoyed working there."
good,"im an outbound associate, at amazon you are expected to have a weekly rate of 101% or more per week. i will put boxes on a pallet after i have scanned each one at a time until the pallet is up to your chest. or i will be loading trucks for half a day on rated function"
good,Amazon was a good place to work.  They had some odd policies.  Kids straight out of college hired as managers to run the floor.  To several of these kids (managers) it was their 1st job EVER and it is very apparent.
good,I have no complaints about working at amazon. Its a great company to work for. The training is done well as well as all the managers are always willing to help you.
good,"start off work with a team stretch , mangers explain what needs to be done for the day and we clap it out and get to work. first is the scanning when that's done we wrap the pallets up and send them to the trucks . when were all finshed with that prep the floor for the next shift"
good,"This job is different every single day.  No 2 days are the exactly the same.  If you are a person who enjoys a fast paced environment this job is for you! It will keep you physically fit ( must be able to work 10+ hours, walk on concrete anywhere from 3-12miles a day,  and able to left 40+ pounds.  Amazon supplies an array of benefits and opportunity both within and outside the company."
good,"Always hand on"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon. The management was great, the co-workers as well. With me starting school and also the commute to the work site made things difficult. I came to the decision to leave but enjoyed my time there. The Management was very enthusiastic and interactive the co-workers were friendly, fun to work with but when it came to working things always got done. A typical day would be start off with greets and smiles from both employees and management. Furthermore, the work day was long but with two breaks it made time go by quicker. Usually, I'd help anyone who had items missing or damaged as soon as possible. The hardest part of the job was dealing with 10 issues at once, and standing on your feet for hours on end. The most enjoyable part was when they gave away prizes and time off work for your hard work. I learned a lot there, I became much more patience and learned how to multitask much better."
good,A typical day at Amazon would be clocking into work. Participate in the start of shift start up meeting which is held by a member of management. Stretching would commence while daily news is read over the PA system. I would then log into my work station and begin my job as a receiver. I have leaned that team work is the key function at Amazon in order to have things run smooth. I work around a diverse multi cultural environment. The hardest part of my job is probably working 10 hours a night. The most enjoyable part of the job I do at Amazon would be when I am Problem Solving and I get to help receivers with problems they may have when receiving.
good,"My day starts with a team huddle to discuss the day's schedule and where we stand in terms of metrics both Quality and Productivity of the previous day and tasks to complete in the next 8 hours. This also includes projects that I have taken up additionally."
good,Great place to work worth the drive will be able to provide for your family in no time peak season their is a shuttle bus that leaves from the fairgrounds and when you get on the bus your clocked in for work
good,"I had no time for my family and I was sort of relieved when the contract ended. Money is good and people are great to work with, they have amazing benefits, such as medical aid being basically free"
good,Beautiful place to work .Right place to start up the carrer.Limited knowledge is driven need to learn lot from own interest.
good,"I've worked here for about 8 months, for a part time job it is pretty good. The only downside is that in my building it isn't possible to become full time and picking up extra shifts isn't always possible."
good,I enjoyed working by myself and getting things done .. the day went as a breeze because there was so much work that had to be done.
good,"Working from home takes discipline. Amazon is a great company with great hours. The management is awesome and dependable. i started working there in 2015, and I have only had positive experiences. There is a great management team that is there for support and advice. You also have a direct manager who you can use as support. Everyone is pleasant and very helpful. They also offer overtime often."
good,"The hours were great, I was able to work from home with my position. The supervisor was always there when I needed her and the coworkers were very supportive of each other. Always opportunities for overtime."
good,The pricing engine is connected to Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) such that customers can sign-in and get access to their own special pricing.
good,"Amazon is a pretty cool job when it comes to being flexible with your schedule that is definitely a plus, it also provides weekly pay which is great. However you are only getting 4hrs a day can only work 30hrs a week, but no overtime is given."
good,"it is a nice place to start your working experience, teach you so many good things and you will learn to work with so many different people around the corner ."
good,"Ogólnie wrażenie dobre, zapewnianą posiłki ciepłe na stołówce oraz zapewniają dojazd, panuje tam miła atmosfera."
good,"Los compañeros y jefes muy buenos y comprensivos,te enseñan bien con paciencia.El lugar de trabajo genial,como en casa."
good,This is a company that puts you first. They are concerned about safety on the job and getting the product to the customer. They train you to believe that you are the one receiving the product that you are shipping.
good,Amazon is a really great place to work and I have learned a lot as a fresher here as this is my first job. It is growing rapidly in India and I am truly proud to be a part of this company.
good,"Amazon is great when you're a rookie in the field of Industrial safety. My day begins with the tool box talk then various inspections to check whether the men are working as per  the requirements of safety policies of Amazon. I learned here to overcome my stage fear. The workplace culture of Amazon is just fantastic. The hardest part of my job is when any external vendor arrives and I'm alone on the floor. And the most enjoyable part of my job is when, any senior safety personnel arrives to audit the site as then I get more things to learn."
good,"Good  benefits, qualified managers,  the pay rate is great, During the summertime find a way to cool departments, the dress code policy is cool u allowed to come as comfortable as u want to"
good,"un gran equipo de trabajo, los encagados un gran trato con el personal."
good,"Amazon was Tough and very Fun. But very strict at the same time, Long hours and Acceptable pay was motivating along with the additional days off helped."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts out with a briefing of the days production volume, then we exercise and stretch out. Workplace culture is work hard, have fun and make history. Management is great with making themselves available at all times and will listen to your concerns. What I learned is if you work hard you will be rewarded and the hardest part of the job is when other people don't pull there weight. But, overall it's the BEST company I have been apart of in the past decade. GREAT COMPANY!!!!"
good,"they are very flexible with the schedules and allow time off if needed, there are good managers and people and the benefits are really good, a lot of giveaways during peak season."
good,"While I have been working here at Amazon.  It is something different, but I like the excitement of the change of pace for myself.  I push myself to achieve different goals each day I am there."
good,Although it was a contract position I enjoyed working for Amazon.  Doppler Building has a lot of amenities for employees to grab a snack or to take a much needed break.  If you are a hard worker then you will enjoy working at Amazon.
good,Fast paced and a great work environment. Have to scan boxes and load trucks with the customers packages. Overnight job. Hours vary between midnight-6 or 7 in the morning
good,"Packing items before shipment. Knowing safe and safety rules in warehouse. "
good,"*It was nice working there and it was quite fun "
good,"Working for amazon is super fast paced especially if you are in picking. You must meet a certain ""rate"" while working. Your pretty much working/standing in the same area unless your going to break or to the restroom. Pretty nice job, hard at first but then you get used to the speed. Nice pay too."
good,enjoyed the people i worked with met a lot of new people. some of the managers are not very friendly or should i say not people friendly but overall decent job for short term
good,"The one of the Best Warehouse Jobs, they have"
good,Productive and very nice workplace. Very nice people worked there. Management was very friendly as well. That was good time for me.
good,"I like working here, its fun and i like the fact that Amazon are flexible and have a relaxed approach to things. Non strict nature. 4 days  work and three days off. "
good,"•	Provide assistance to the sellers related to uploading the product information on the website via calls and emails."

good,Amazon is a fun loving place employees are treated very well and they get a chance to learn new things. Co workers are good and help each other in the work tasks.
good,"Easy to work there, fun to do, different departments and promotions available. They are a good company with good management and good pay rates. Highly recommended."
good,"I will work for Amazon any day, great people there to work with, anyone can make it at Amazon its a relief how people are so at comfort with one another"
good,"receiving, packaging, loading, stocker, lifting up to 50 lbs, shipping, forklift sit down, stand up, power electric pallet jack, plastic wrap, and scanning products"
good,the pay is great and the benefits are nice management can be kind of rude sometimes you will have to stand on your feet up to 10 hours co-workers are great people to work with
good,I found this job to be very fulfilling and a pleasure to do.  Everyone from your fellow associate to management made the job worth going to.  The pay and bonuses help too.
good,"nice work enverment"
good,"I am not much for being a stower, but I have been in receive for two years now and there is no where else I would rather be in the facility. Always busy, loing periods of stnding, constant easy going flow. Management is always changing. Managers come and go more than associates. Communication through facilities and others could always use work.Co-workers are typically always great people that become more like family."
good,As long as you can get on the schedule that works for you cant ask for more. The pay great. Benefits are awesome. People are great to work with. As long as u can maintain you rate there is no prolem. Mangement never harassed you breathe on your back. Peak season will wear on you with all the MANDATORY overtime.
good,Amazon was very fast paced.   There was always something to do and the management made it a very friendly work enviornment as well.  The pay was also very good
good,i was always on the move.  I learned to do paper work and I was sometimes in charge of my area because the manager was sometimes not there. Some of the groups of people were at times hard to understand and some of the questions were complicate to figure out what they were trying to say.  The hardest part was to figure out what station I was going to be at for the day.  The most enjoyable part was getting to know the new people who would be soon full time employees and seeing them improve on there skills with the different tasks.
good,"Enjoyed the work environment. Met our needs as a temporary, well paying job.  They also paid for our RV site and utilities.  Required long hours (holiday season) to meet demand."
good,"Amazon as a company has a great work culture. You meet people in various age groups and can learn many things from them. As Amazon was my first job I learnt many things like taking ownership of tasks, looking into every issue that came along and rectifying it as soon as possible. The people working there are easily approachable and they have an open door policy. Where you can go and meet anyone in the system even if they are at a higher level than you are. "
good,"unpredictable if there will be mandatory or voluntary overtime for each department, will also change in a very short amount of time. management is always changing like a revolving door"
good,"was a beautiful experience working on amazon"
good,"Very good working environment. It has been close to 9 years and I think, it's time to try other opportunities and explore the world outside Amazon."
good,"i enjoyed working at this company,  i learned a lot "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when we hear music in every one hour for some minutes. The hardest part of the job is to lift bigger box to the pallet. Talking about my co-workers they are having a good time with everyone.Our management people are always running around to help all the lanes. I learned so many things while working in a big place like amazon. My typical day of work is that i took overtime and stood for 10 hours.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work.  I was not micromanaged.  I was given guidelines to follow, which I did.  I had no problems with any of my co-workers.  Amazon truly has the customer's experience as their number 1 priority. I was asked to take items that were received in the warehouse and scanned the items into the Amazon system.  Management was continually training and encouraging growth on how to scan more items in quickly and efficiently."
good,"so many thing going on at one time"
good,"I answer questions that associates ask, help out on the computer. I also help out in the amcare with translating.  I help the supervisor when they need help with associates."
good,It's not a bad job just management have poor decision making when it comes to the employees. Nobody has a answer they make you research information. Normally HR has most of the unknown answer but they just what they are with no information on employees base. I was known for HR to walk you out and have at least a little detail or information about the work place as for what goes on inside the plant but they don't if manger send you to them they send you right back to the manager.
good,I would still work here if they would not change the metric requirements. I enjoyed my time with Amazon and made a lot of great job experiences
good,"I enjoyed working at amazon, everyone was helpful. Each day they would take the time to make sure hat we were working in a productive environment they always pushed us to be the best we could be  an their was always work to be done ad set goal for the team also they would switch everyone around to experience different work areas"
good,"Was a good place to work, only drawback was some of the management they didn't consider the workers their only concern was numbers and production.  Didn't care about the working conditions. Some managements didn't have working knowledge of the jobs that had to be performed so all they cared about was getting the job done, didn't care about the conditions in performing the job."
good,Awesome co-workers whenever there was something very heavy to lift or if their something i needed help with someone was always there to help and i think that is always a great thing
good,"You come in, get pumped for the day as a worker. Management was pretty well on time, and switched people from place to place as the day went on."
good,"Amazon is a inconstant work place, everyday you are up to new challenges. We work as a Team. The co workers are a joy to have there at the job, they make the place fun. Management is understanding if you ever need an barrier resolved."
good,"Typical factory work, learned to work as a large team and how online shopping works."
good,"A Typical day of work was meeting everyone in an area while our supervisors would discuss goals for the day and prior goals that were achieved and after 15 or so minutes we would be dismissed to our stations. "
good,"It was enjoyable, easy work. Co workers were really nice and got along with everyone easily. Was well respected and was asked to do multiple different jobs around the warehouse."
good,This company is very effective and good working so i like this company this will give full satisfaction to workers abou their work.
good,I have spent the last six months working a seasonal assignment with Amazon and it has truly been a wonderful experience. I have learned so much about the companies culture and gained many new experiences and friends along the way. This is a great company to work for and it has absolutely made me customer obsessed to no end and I can see why now.
good,A good place to work. They treated their people good. They also were  always giving out rewards. More fast paced which was nice.
good,"It's a fun filled environment, but the work is obviously hard. I've learned a lot from the organisation, as to how to communicate with different people, balance the work life."
good,everyone is very friendly and patiently with each other. i learned something new everyday.  the management are very cool people to work with .  the co workers have very nice manners.  there isnt a hardent part of the job at the moment . i enjoy all the time being there .
good,a typical day at work at amazon its ok I leanred to move at a really fast pace their management is great all of my co workers was fine the hardest part of the job is continuing to move fast after you get a lil tired the most enjoyable part of the job is when the day is over and when checks come out.
good,"good pay good work out nice people just all around good company to work for and a good place to grow and have a future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,"productive with good working environment coupled with lots of benefits,compensation and carrier choices.health care,"
good,It was a great experience working here at Amazon. I enjoyed working her and met a lot of nice people.  Reason why i left was that i couldn't keep working nights and i cant work day shift because i don't have a ride for my children to and from school.
good,"My experience at Amazon was a great experience. Shipping and receiving was fun for me because we challenged ourselves every shift to beat the day shifts numbers. Pushing each other in a positive mind set and helping each other out with loading trucks, and wrapping items. From the big bosses to the managers to even the associates, no matter what your level was in the company, they helped out EVERYWHERE. I would say the hardest part of the job was being at work for 12 hours straight, but it didn't really hit until I actually got home and laid in bed."
good,Also had a  good experience there. Projects were explained on time and good team members. The manager was so helpful. Plenty time to complete the project.
good,the benefits are good as well as the pay. had fun working with and meeting new people. the management is a bit iffy but they do have an open door policy that works on the employees favor. its a very easy job any department you go to is very simple when it comes to completing the tasks
good,"I would walk in normaly and do something new around the warehouse several other days. Learned how to stow, pick, recieve, and damage. My co-workers were cool and mostly everyone there was kind. The only hard part is to make rate, but that is only hard if you are a lazy worker. I made rate everyday and most times beyond the required rate. The most enjoyable part was to leave work."
good,Amazon is a very good organisation to start your career with. It has multiple opportunities to grow and allows a wide platform for people to learn new processes.
good,Work culture @ amazon is very good. It has been a great working experience working at amazon.com. I have learned lot of professional skills here.
good,Overall it has been a great experience. typical work day very busy. I've met amazing people. I've learned a lot. Everyday you walk thru the door its a guarantee you will learn something new.
good,"When call flow too much not able to take enough rest."
good,"a typical day at amazon its hardworking, fast pace working environment. you are doing hands-on projects and working with a lot of people.."
good,"Esta es mi primera experiencia de trabajo, y es muy positiva. "
good,"Hello,"
good,"Was a good place to work, a lot of walking involved, and squatting, it becomes hard on your knees eventually. Very good pay and benefits though. The average employment time for my department was only 6 months."
good,"I am currently employed with this company and i have read some of the reviews from other people who used to work here or work here now and i'm so surprised.  I love it here.  I have a family and i get to see my family we work 4 days and have 3 days off.  I work in receiving and there are so many aspects in receiving you can work in ISS or the dock or the line, problem solve, prep.  I want to learn more about my FC but i like receiving.  They don't give us any shift changes because we are over employed but now I am going to try outbound so I can get the days I want.  Too many people cry about the hours and breaks and money. I make good money my checks are good and during peak they are great.  For peak I only had to work a month of 5 11 hour days that was it.  I wanted more. You know before you even except the job what is expected of you.  If you can stand for more then 8 hours dont take the job why cry about it.  Yes you work but isnt that what we get paid to do? I love coming here and seeing the faces of the many people I have met yes there are attitudes but believe me the managers will weed out the bad and keep the willing and hard working ones.  They have great benefits and we have vacation time unpaid time and paid time.  If we dont feel like coming in we don't even have to call out we just dont come in.  How many people have that at their jobs.  I am a problem solver now and I love figuring out things and why the packages dont work. I have tried for the PA position and I havent been inclined yet but I sure dont' give up it just shows me they want good people in the leading"
good,Pick items off the line and pack them in boxes. Check orders for correct items. Scan barcodes. A lot of work but very manageable.
good,"You are required to start work immediately after announcements and stretches. I have learned a great deal in the year and 2 months working there. I have learned the basic work functions of a few departments and have learned how to solve basic associates problems by being a problem solver and using various computer programs to do so. Management is okay, you got to be careful because they keep a watchful eye on you. Hardest part of the job is lifting 50+lbs. boxes and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping other and being recognized for your hard work."
good,"Very fast paced"
good,"A company has resource and talent to enable fast learning and promotion if you can succeed. Folks with good balance of technical knowledge and leadership can really excell. However, if you are in the growing phase of your career, the company is growing very quickly and can easliy forget career development for the indidvidual. This limits the opportunity for certain type of people."
good,Before the start of a shift we would have stand up they would give us a station an we get to work we had to process 230 items per hour an i would always reach my goal. I learned how to communicate more with my co workers. the hardest part for me was the long 12 hour shifts.
good,"* Great place for freshers to learn the work culture."
good,The company rules are good.And the working environment is nice the salary and the benefits providing by the company are also good.
good,"A very high paced, work intensive environment. Daily and weekly quotas are always to be met, comraderie with fellow co-workers"
good,Nice friendly culture ! its  fun being at Amazon . Very open culture . no strict environment . only problem is the night shift working hours
good,"Fast paced and fun environment with supportive management encouraging you to do your best in order to advance to the next level  in the company. warehouse was very hot at times during the summer other than that it was a good place to work. The money was good,but the healthcare was amazing. The benefits alone was almost enough for the job alone."
good,"Great Company to work for Benefits, compensation packages, the best relocation options. You get raises every 6 mths and opportunities for advancement . Great Company to work for they pay for you to go to school for good paying careers"
good,"picking is fast pace and very easy job to handle meeting 100 percent or more a night to plan and of course able to walk for about 9 hrs long around mod, amazon need high energy positive employees to handle the constant change and challenges of amazon."
good,"Operated hand held scanners, pallet jack, scanned merchandise into bins, loaded and unloaded trucks. was a great team member that come in first place more than once."
good,Working at Amazon you will learn a lot it's also i great place to work you meet new people. everyone there helps each other with whatever they need.
good,I loved the job. Everyone is so friendly and willing to help others. The only downfall is that they only hire seasonally.
good,"Great place to work, management is very supportive, Great competitive, not much room for advancement in regards to pay (only done on tenure basis)"
good,"Amazon always allows employees to benefit from working there. Whether it be raffle opportunities, the ability to move up in the company and great medical benefits."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management."
good,"when I worked here the managers were very kind, and they did what they could to help you preform your duties the best and easiest way possible. Before we started our shift they would have us stretch and loosen up, they would also go over the safety guidelines so that everyone remembered to stay safe. They also listened to  you when you had a problem and did what they could to fix the issue."
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work at, with a great work culture and positive vibe. Everyday is back to day one."
good,"This was a good company to work for, i worked there for 3 years and had lots of fun and got lots of free stuff, of course the benefits were great too.. however they have very high standards, sometimes too high.. it is almost impossible to work at amazon and you almost have to be super human.. but it is rewarding in the end, the job is not for everyone, if you cannot or wont allow yourself to be pushed beyond your limits this job is not for you."
good,"At my time with Amazon it was a great experience. This was my first warehouse and the people made it better. The hardest part about the job was, i would say would be shrink wrapping pallets at times."
good,"With a staggering array of metrics and analytics, Amazon.com is truly the most customer centric organization in the world.  A true pleasure to work alongside so many gifted and brilliant people that are all dedicated to the customer."
good,I love working at Amazon a really good company to work for. This company acknowledge whoever done service in the military in all fields very good.
good,Amazon also known as Gym amazon. Never standing still always moving and keeping occupied. Delighting people around the world with products they love.
good,"Amazon.in company is excellent and Amazon.in logisic number one india ,Amazon working smart and nice ,amazon get main offer to custumers .custumers satisfaction  and good serviecs"
good,"really fun working here in amazon, the people , culture and dress code. work stress freely .if  anyone have new ideas that can improve the process , people are welcome the ideas if it really mean."
good,Every day is a new day. Customer obsession is the key element at Amazon. Every day will be a challenging day and this will improve the carrier growth.
good,Great environment to work at. Typical day at work is answering the phones helping the customer with there issues. Management is great. They will work with you if you have any problems and will talk to you about anything. Co-workers are laid back and nice. The hardest part of the job would have to be when you cant resolve a issue with the customer. Sometimes there's nothing you can do. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when you actually realize how much you help the company and that you make the customers happy.
good,I enjoyed working with Amazon. It is hard to find a group of people that will have no problems with working with each other.
good,"A typical work day at Amazon consist of nonstop work. stand for 10+ hours. lift 70lbs or more. I learn a lot about how a business should and should not be run, how organize to unorganized it could go quickly. I learn that you have to meet a certain requirement at the job in order to succeed as a company. The coworkers could either be a good or bad thing depending on what you make them out to be for. if you work well together to get the job done then there will be nothing to worry about. however, if you use the coworkers to make time fly by, by talking horsing around then that could end in a very bad situation. The hardest part of the job was being switch to different jobs at once then have to go back to a job that was on a timely rate after coming from a job that didn't care about the rate time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits and working for the company helping it grow and reach its goals."
good,"As a ship clerk I am tasked to getting product out of the building. An average is about 150,000 units in a 10 hour day. I learned how to set up the utilization for maximum efficiency. Management tries but seem to be overloaded and that causes them to miss things that need to be noticed. The people can pull together and work as an awesome team. The hardest part of my job would be the attention to detail you need because you can make a huge mistake that puts your job on the line. The most enjoyable part is the challenge and chance to be part of something."
good,"It was fun to work there, and the had games in both of there game rooms. Whenever we lost equipment they had machines that would replace it for us for free."
good,hard work required and lots of sleep until u adjust to the work and schedule. I enjoyed working stow more than pick and maybe because i just didnt have the shoes for walking at the time. Because believe you me that you will be walking ALOT!
good,Amazon Is  best in Salary but There are nothing to learn NEW. I want to learn new work and want to get experience in new work..
good,"The only hard part of the job would be trying to load your tote with a maximum 50 items but the items can sometimes be bigger than the tote, so you have to always keep placing them on the conveyor."
good,"Amazon.com is a productive and safe environment to work in. I am a problem-solver (computer and detail oriented work) and I'm in the ISS department which deals with trouble tickets. The 10 hour shifts are cascading, so every day there are different associates starting their work week. "
good,"the sorter would get jamed almost as soon as the day began."
good,not a bad place to work.  hard to move up though due to the fact the hardly promote with in.  They are not afraid to let you go either.
good,"When left alone to do the job, I liked it, especially the Tech Support."
good,"Colleghi giovani."
good,"A typical day at work would be, everyone is so focused on the job at hand just do what you need to do and everything will go smoothly. Don't get complaisant tho, else you will find yourself lagging behind everyone else and getting in trouble for not meeting targets etc. I learned that, if you put your mind to something and just work as hard as you can then even at Amazon with there level of productivity they expect and the bar they set its more than capable to have fun and work at Amazon. Management is excellent, always there to help and make sure you do things right and any mistakes are rectified etc. Co workers are superb, more than most or just so easy to get along with and if you make yourself known to people you can make friends easy. The hardest part of the job, seeing as I worked for them during peak times, it was the peak days where you had to meet high high targets, Black Friday was rough, mistakes made and your back in the next day having a worst day making up for mistakes. So peak times can get rough for sure, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the work, it keeps you working all day for me that was the most enjoyable part because I love to work, also having good co-workers around makes it so much more fun if you have friends around you whilst working."
good,For the most part the hardest thing about this job was walking and standing for 12 hours straight. That was about it was able to meet new people.
good,"i learned alot at amazon. a typical day at work was just making sure your accuracy was on point. Then yould would go get set up at your station, if you are new you would be partnered up with a buddy . The management team was very cool and laid back if you stayed on your job. The hardest part of the job was standing for 12 hours. The most enjoyable part was the 12.25 per hr."
good,A very fast-paced environment. Lots of potential growth in company if desired. Managers are usually assisted by a process assistant which can contact or relay any messages from employees.
good,I didnt mind it at all i loved it & i wouldnt mind working their again. I learned to packed a product right. How to stack boxes the right way before they got shipped out. The job was not hard at all.
good,"was a very rewarding experience"
good,I've heard a lot of mixed things about working at Amazon. My experience is that my team was AWESOME! I loved the work I did there and I loved the understanding project managers that made themselves available.
good,"This Job overall was fast paced, with a large number of employees in the building at one time."
good,"Learning To Serve, Serving To Learn."
good,"We got alot of overtime i like to work,management was good,i learned how to build shelve to hold merchandise,and build a warehouse from bottom to top 3 stories stairs and floors.The most enjoyable part of my job was learning something new."
good,Its a exciting place to work its great benefits but the only problem is that it has bad communication skills
good,I gained a lot of computer skills while working in this job and gained experience In talking to people. The team I worked with was a great help especially finishing takes on time.
good,"a typical day working at amazon is great friendly and fun there are very good people to work with, great environment to work in."
good,cool company to work for its hard work but it can pay off dont like the point part
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and being able to go out everyday I worked and just be on my own and pick orders at a rate per hour.
good,"nice people,nice are,good workplaces.good shift times"
good,"Amazon.com is a great company to work for in the call center aspect. But don't get your hopes up, to stay there as a secured employee."
good,Aprendi a interactuar mas con la gente y mediar conflictos.
good,"I learnt a lot in Amazon. My job inckuded:"
good,"Amazing start with my core knowledge on chemistry back then, I was able to contribute more than what I had thought of and cope at a faster pace."
good,"A typical day at work is just a regular day, start at 8 and work till 10.45 then 1st 15 min break in the canteen, then back to work at 11 till 1.45 from working different sections and on different floors. Then at 1.45 a half hour lunch break to which we chill in canteens or outside in the smoking area then back to work from 2.15. Then work from 2.15 till 4.30 then the last break of the day for 15mins, 20mins if the heat in the FC is near 30 degrees. Then same routine, working on different floors in different sections. Then back to work from 4.45/50 till 6.30 when work finishes. I learned alot about how the company works to it's best for the customers and their needs. The management there were productive, always keeping the workers on their toes. Certain co-workers were rude and incapable of working with, but the majority were friendly and hardworking. The hardest part  of the job is being on your feet for too long of the 10 1/2 hours we are there and lastly the most enjoyable part of the job is working in the J/H sections on Multis as it makes your targets go up also you get more done throughout the day. Would definitely recommend working here."
good,"The job itself is easy. Answer phone calls about retail orders, billing, or kindle devices. Good breaks and lunch hours. Wonderfully clean facility."
good,"I would start work at 8am and finish at 6.30."
good,"I stand at a station and pack boxes with customers orders. I put bubble wrap in the box so the items are tight and secure inside, then I tape the box and send it down the line to be shipped out to the customer. Management is usually pretty fair and safety is always topic of discussion. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that there will be a smile on someone's face when they receive their package. The hardest part is standing on your feet for ten hours."
good,"I love the culture in Amazon"
good,"10 Hours a day walking , picking items "
good,"•	Provides floor support and feedback to Associates on e-mail contacts with a focus on improving productivity and quality of the team"
good,I enjoyed the job. Peak is a good time to make more money. Depending on what you do can be very tiresome.
good,"I would come to work begin the shift with stretches have my first break and then my lunch break come back, stretches again, then finish the second have of the shift. I learned a lot of thing I wasn't in knowledge with before, I learned how to work machines, I learned the process of shipping and handling and picking items with a radio frequency scanner. Management at times was poor, there were many times where I felt uncomfortable with situations and I had approached to them and had my situation ignored. I loved my co workers, I believe that having good coworkers makes work a lot more easy going. The hardest part of my job was probably having to stand in one spot for multiple hours. A lot of jobs you have to stand all day but there is definitely a big difference when you walk around all day and just stand in one spot all day. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with others and the environment."
good,"would love to work there again. long hours, would like to see a larger pay out because the amount of work that is done really dont add up to the amount of pay"
good,I was a packer and it was hard because i also worked in shipping. the pay rate was good but i never saw the day of light i would go in at 7am and come out at 6pm sunday thru wednesday.
good,"ambiente lavorativo giovanile,dinamico,i superiori sono ragazzi giovanissimi e che quindi sono molto vicino al lavoratore in termini di idee,interessi,etc.."
good,picked or packed depending on shift. learned how to drive order picker. managemanet was ok. co-workers very friendly. hardest part is moving through crowded isles. enjoyable part is staying busy and competitive goals.
good,i love working there just there is somethings i dont really like
good,"I just had a great time working with new people everyday. It was a fast pace to work, time always went by pretty quick. Hours were the best Sun-Tues 12 hr shifts and Weds was 4 shifts."
good,Amazon is probably the best place to start your career. This company will help understand the working of the corporate world with a perfect balance of hard-work and fun. It is this unique balance which provides a very rich learning experience.
good,help achieve company goals. good company to work with great people
good,"First shift, was a great position and I wish it last longer.  I enjoyed all of the walking it was great exercise each day, I also loved the people."
good,"A typical day at Amazon (as a temporary worker via Integrity) as a ""picker"" comes down to finding products within the warehouse, bar-scanning the items appropriately, and sending the products along the conveyor system.  A person should anticipate lots of walking, and I would recommend finding good walking shoes at least a week before actually starting the job.  Safety measures are a daily reminder at stand-up meetings.  The hardest part of being a ""picker"" is taking care of ones feet because a worker should anticipate walking 15+ miles/day.  Integrity Solutions is a temporary agency, and there is opportunity for advancement to be an Amazon associate after 90+/- days contingent to showing excellent working habits and keeping good attendance."
good,"Everyone stays on task and it is a very good work environment. I love working at a fast pace and keeping busy and I was constantly doing so. Every day I would scan a chute and pack the items that needed to be boxed for that order. I gained so many more skills on organization and productivity, that i still to this day use. The most enjoyable part of this job was to keep busy and not to be bothered all the time. I was able to be productive without any distractions and got a lot of work done every day."
good,"Its a pretty fast paced company, the priority is numbers (Rate) - there's a lot of standing, bending, and picking up heavy objects.  The co- workers were very helpful , they helped me find different ways to make rate without having to run and burn myself out."
good,It is an great place to work an lots of experience to learn from.
good,I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. The hours were perfect for family. I liked working 4 10hr days. I liked the diverse positions.
good,"I would sign in and get ready to work everyday.  I learned How to move diligently and work smart not hard to get the job done.  Management were very helpful in making sure I was comfortable and understood my job.  My co-workers were easy to get along with, and we worked well together to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job for me was the excessive walking.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was knowing that customers were pleased."
good,For the most part it is a fun place to be at. Except for those long nights when they request you to stay longer than you were supposed to.
good,some management needs work other than that no complaints.Some days are slower than others overall easy job. Hard part is dealing with unruly customers.
good,Long hours met by great wages and benefits. The management is well oiled for being such a new building. As long as your motivated and a hard worked you won't have any issues here.
good,I really enjoyed working at Amazon It was a wonderful feeling to be able to help customers and compensate them when they had problems with their orders. I have taking irate calls from customers and by the time we hung up that customer was calm I took bad situation and turned them to a positive situation and that made me feel great..  I would have loved for this to have been a permanent position I enjoyed working her more than any job I have had in my past
good,One of the best environment to work for those who want to develop themselves and are open to challenges. A platform for reaching out to you professional and career goal
good,"When we were looking into working for Amazon we were told that it was hard work.  We felt that we were used to hard work so took the job.  We are retired and are full-time rvers and workampers."
good,"1. A typical work day, especially during peak, was conducting multiple department trainings, testing, and inputting data. "
good,"Typical day at work :•	Supporting team of Electrical Engineers and Mechanical Engineers responsible for safe and reliable data center operation."
good,"The work hours are flexible. I was a software developer at Amazon. It's really fun to work here. There are no fixed working hours, people are very helpful. There is no management oversight at all. The hardest part of the job is strict deadlines."
good,"Outstanding communication skills. Comfortable interacting with all organizational and cultural levels."
good,"Typical day at work .. Packing and handling box and materials putting kits together"
good,A typical day consists of researching and reviewing missing or lost inventory.  I learned how to constantly stay ahead of a fast paced online retail store. Management does a great job of staying on top of rapid changes in various departments and communicates well with their employees.  My co-workers have all learn to adapt and adjust to working in various departments at a moments notice.  The hardest part of my job is the locating missing inventory in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part of my job is researching and analyzing various amounts of data.
good,"fast paced easy work for the ""wanting to work"". good work place and easy to get along with others."
good,"A typical day at work; clock in, go to stand up, listen to the safety tip and what all needs to be done, look on the board to see what you will be doing for the day. Have your scan gun ready and start working up until break. The Hardest thing about working at Amazon is they want you to move at a fast pace. Make sure your not off task and stay busy working. The enjoyable part is that everyone is friendly and they will help you if you need it."
good,"Learnt a lot technically "
good,"Day starts swipe your badge to get through the gate and eat breakfast/snack asap if you get to work early. After breakfast you immediately join the meeting/huddle for your work shift which is basically a itinerary for the day in which includes your workload, and areas of the building you will be in for the day depending on if your stowing or picking your locations vary. It's usually a 10-12 hour work shift with 2 15min breaks and a 30min lunch. You swipe your badge to clock in and out for every break, lunch, upon arrival, and upon departure."
good,"Everyday we have to pick a certain amount of units"

good,it was a good paying job and had great teamwork. and the bosses we'er active with the employees. and help motivate the workers to work at their best and make the numbers we had to make everyday
good,"Basically, we go in and meet up with the manager for stretching for a few minutes ; have a small discussion about what is expected.Go to work two hours. Then,take first break for 15 minutes,then come back and work until luch. Lunch was 30 minutes. Next go back and stretch and discuss. Then back to work through out the rest of the day."
good,"I enjoyed my time with amazon.com. Providing world class customer service. Amazon is a customer oriented company with a great focus on taking care of the employees as well. With amazon I learned how to identify customer pain points and help eliminate them using the six sigma process. I always enjoyed learning from and teaching my fellow co-workers. While being apart of the escalation team, customers were pretty upset by the time they were transferred to me, while most people would get flustered I saw that as an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation and brightens someones day. Rapport and courtesy go along way."
good,"Typical day would be long in on time wait for your team leaders to brief you on whats happening then head to your station to work which would be for me re-bin or packing on multi-medium, well i was there i learned a lot, the great thing about a warehouse there is so many different jobs to do so your always learning, the management was fair there, obvious you had numbers to hit so as long as you worked hard they encouraged you to have a bit of fun as well, my co-workers were great to work with theydidn't mind showing you the easiest and quickest way to do something, the hardest part of the job was when you first start this is because your on your feet all day and you do find it quite tiring but after a few weeks you adjust to it, the most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting good at my station and cause its such a large place your always meeting new people you can have a laugh with."
good,"excellent company to work for, nice folks and high impact and interpersonal communications is required."
good,ogni giorno lavorativo mi cercavano di formare in base al tipo di lavoro che dovevi svolgere. ottimo il rapporto con colleghi di lavoro ed anche con leader e manager.
good,"I would arrive at work 15 to 20 mins before my shift started, get some coffee to get some energy for the beginning of the day. Attend the daily stand up meetings, stretch at the end and start working afterwards. Take two fifteen minute breaks than a thirty minute lunch break and several hours later another fifteen minute break. Ten minutes before the shift is over we would meet for an end of the day stand up and they would give us an assessment of our progress. The management was great. They were always willing to go out of their way to help and give advice. They always tried to motivate the other employees and also tried their best to be friendly. The hardest part of the job was working the 60 hr weeks. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people while working and seeing some of the products coming in."
good,My favorite aspect was the music and the fact that amazon appreciates their employees; the hardest part was all the walking; I had great coworkers and a wonderful management team. On a typica dayl we enventoried items throyghout the building; on a good day we would be in one location most of the day.
good,"I love working for the company and wish I had a permanent position that grants me security. I have learned so much more about myself and the variety of people that I worked with. I have became patient, patient and customer obsessed. The management here at Amazon was very well structured and are excellent in all they do. The hardest part of the job was taking multiple chats with two challenging customers at the same time. I enjoy the culture, the people, atmosphere, management and the free things we got from time to time."
good,"Loved the environment, the deadlines, the seasonal rush ...Finally, I found a job that matched my energy !!!"
good,"Amazon is a really nice company to work for in Cape Town if you have very little to no work experience and not a very strong formal qualificatio. The majority of the business in Cape Town is Customer Service, so it is not ideally suited for really individuals who come from a tertiary background. THe room for growth is nice but ainly within the customer service space. Other than the affore mentioned, Amazon is a really great place to work for, the culture is amazing, and you won't find a better place to work when you just start your working career. Everyone is really engaging, helpful and friendly, which all contributes to really relaxed and easy working environment."
good,stand in one place all day andd stack products on footprint and send them down them coveyer belt. the hardest part of the job is just to make sure all the products are not to high to fit in the boxes.
good,"Fast-paced environment, goes smoothly as long as you take criticism well and apply it to your work. Coworkers are usually extremely friendly, so are staff coaches. The hardest part of the job would be the hours, but the money is worth it and and time flies by when you keep busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being recognized for any achievements you have made and goals you have reached."
good,Excellent place of employment. During off peak months you prepare your training schools and perform cross training of all associates that are requested for other positions. Also you are the person that grants all the permissions to employees. create all PMV's(proccess visual maps)will also create all signage in house and place them at each proccess work area. Will perform all work place audits on associates and several other daily responsibilities

good,a seasonal contract sometines its busy sometimes you went home early..the management is nice they give us a raise after a month.very fast paced environment but enjoyable
good,My typical day at work is hustling/bustling to get product/orders out for customer orders. I enjoy the high demand because it keeps for moving and the excitment of shopping for other people. Managers are involed in the daily activities. Some co/workers are very knowledegable of the jobs some are not. The hardest part of the job is standing for 10hrs a day. The most enjoyable part is knowing that the customer gets their order at the date requested and coworkers are involved helping with the process.
good,It 's a great place to work for Amazon..
good,received product into building so stowers could replenish the shelves/ also researched purchase orders.
good,I enjoy working at amazon its just they could care a little bit more about there employees. But over all it is a good job experience and I would recommend amazon to anyone.

good,great place to work with people from different cultures and background. very fast paced with the ability to work on your feet for 8 hrs with non stop action
good,"Over all a good company. Needs to work on stability with work. Routes are being cut every day and people are loosing hours. I work 3 days a week now when I was told I was going to work 5 days. I have been working for amazon for about 3 years now and I think its grown and their are great people that I work with, but the amount of days I work isnt enough to support me."
good,While I was at amazon I learned how to work in a fast pace time. I also was very welcomed by other employees overall it was a fun experience. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in a warehouse position.
good,It was an ok job for the season great benefits and easy money if you work with someone who is willing to help u everyday  and be ready for heavy objects

I worked my way up from a processor and have been supported though every step by my management  and have been very grateful. The workplace culture is very customer satisfaction based so it is fast paced with achievable targets."
good,After peak season you’ll get less than 30 hours basically a seasonal job to me it’s great when business is booming but when it isn’t it’s very slow and frustrating
good,"A job as a picker or AFE packer in an Amazon Distribution Center is, ultimately, all about your ability to find and use the fastest and most reliable methods at your disposal to meet worryingly high expectations on a daily basis. Despite that, it was easily one of the best experiences I have ever had in the warehousing industry. The single hardest part of it for me was simply being able to keep up with the demanding pace required, though I would say that the compensation is quite reasonable for what they ask of you. The best part of working as a picker was likely seeing new and interesting things every single day and it certainly made trying to keep up worth it to me."
good,"The management is helpful in training you how to deliver Amazon packages. They’re encouraging and if they see that you’re behind on delivering packages, they send out somebody to help rescue you and help deliver those packages. You’re not chastised about it or written up in anyway. They are there to help you succeed."
good,Me encanta trabajar en Amazon.Muy organizada y amena cuida mucho la seguridad de sus trabajadores son perfectos.Inconvenientes que vas renovando de mes en mes y no sabesque te deparara con respecto a una estabilidad laboral.
good,Amazon è un ottimo ambiente di lavoro..manager..lead e istructor sempre disponibili..sicurezza a livelli eccellenti..lavoro pesante ma perlomeno il tempo passa in fretta..l'unico neo..contratti di lavoro troppo brevi..
good,"Amazon is VERY fast paced, with loud ongoing music to keep workers motivated. MUCH better than working at UPS!! Their organizational system re packages are superb!!"
good,Fast pace work environment. Each day you are assigned a different task which can be challenging for some. Some heavy lifting may be required of you when working as a picker or unloader.
good,Amazon was the best company to start off your career. Working in amazon let be to build a standard or a benchmark against which I would measure the quality of work-life that I would want to be working in.
good,"The typical work evening was great, the managers called a meeting at the start of the each shift to give information about the goal and to stretch before beginning work so nobody would pull a muscle. Everybody was pretty laid back and very easy to get along with!"
good,"Always a new day working here. It's fun and keeps you on your toes even during the ""slow"" periods."
good,"They can lay you off without warning. Even after telling you that they will give you more hours, they do work with you on scheduling but they tend to hire way to many people and then just let them go after they don't need you anymore."
good,Very fast paced but you are still able to engage with your managers and coworkers. Management is all about moving you up if you are looking to advance. Workplace can be a little stressful but managers and learning ambassadors do a good job of keeping everybody calm.
good,"The goal to achieve is to scan all the packages they get per night. Fast work environment, very diversify and flexible with working hours. Management is well organized and help employees achieve the work for the night. you get two breaks plush the lunchtime. The benefits are great."

The support that other category is giving specially my Manager is was extremely helpful in building my carrier with Amazon AE."
good,"I worked here in 2016, it was temporary to hire. I did not get converted to full time but I worked everyday until the last. I returned in 2017 to a different department. My life outside of work was more than I could handle so I had to leave during training. I loved it at Amazon"
good,"Tramite l'esperienza lavorativa avuta, posso dichiarare che Amazon è una azienda seria che ha come obbiettivo soddisfare l'esigenze del cliente, ma allo stesso tempo mettere a proprio agio il lavoratore al fine di arrivare all'obbiettivo citato in precedenza. Per me è stata una esperienza molto soddisfacente, in quanto mi è stata data l'opportunità di mettermi in gioco nonostante non tanta esperienza nel campo dell'assistenza clienti."
good,I loved to drive and meeting the customers needs by delivering their packages on time and in good condition. The supervisors were very helpful and kind.
good,I've met some nice people here. A flexible schedule some may get overwhelmed during peak season. Make pretty good money. They should hire more managers with in the company.

good,"Work environment is good. Seniors are awesome, you will get opportunity to learn. They offer many courses as well to improve your skills."

good,I would recommend an Amazon job only unless you are willing to work for your money. The hours are too long and they add an extra mandatory day to your Rota which is unfair
good,"Très bonne ambiance et bon encadrement de la part du management, beaucoup d’aides pour évoluer correctement et pas de pression quelconque, ce fut une très bonne expérience"
good,Management was always approachable and kind.  They always showed appreciation for a job well done.   Very pleasant working environment.  Co-workers and management were both great.  I think it's great that Amazon will give anybody a chance at employment as long as they pass a background check and a drug test.  I would have to say this is one of the very best companies I have ever worked for.  I actually looked forward to going to work.  Unfortunately I had to leave for personal reasons but would have loved to stay.
good,Nous sommes très bien accueilli et le salaire est interéssant.
good,"The company is quiet professional in terms of working, perks and everything else that you can imagine.The managers are quiet supportive.The rest area is also quiet good."
good,"Its a fast paced job that needs your alertness both physically and mentally..."
good,Grrat company to work for if you have nothing better to do with your spare time so why not earn money. Major changes have now been made and its harder now to feel safe as job security is minimum
good,Amazon is a great place to develop skill sets and expand friendships.  I have had a great experience overall.  I have had a chance to meet both college hires as well as seasoned leaders from industry and military back grounds throughout my career and have sparked lifelong friendships in the process.  Amazon expects alot but the rewards can be big.
good,Nice place to start a career if your not afraid of a little hard work. On site the warehouses get a little cold or hot depending on the time of the year.
good,"Amazon is one of the coolest places to work. It is a customer centric company and focuses on providing utmost importance to its customer service. Employees working with Amazon also understand their company's values and strive to give their best always. Like they always say its still day one at Amazon. Work hard, have fun and make history."

good,I enjoy working at the Hemel Hempstead FC. The environment and culture and very interesting and I am glad to have gotten a chance to experience Amazon at this FC.

good,I saw many people grogress in the company fairly quickly. They were very understanding of my health issues and helped me when I was struggling to keep up with my numbers until i was able to exceed their expectations. When you show you want to work hard and succeed they are there to help you.
good,"Work load is bit high but depends on individual performance. Good spirit among team helps you to grow ."

good,Slow paste work and HR could be more Engaged with Workers including the special ones. My manager was great and respectful always there to help and announcing tips for better health work flow. Scanners would freeze at times and re-work was exaggerated at times. Stowing could be easier then set up for...

good,"I worked at Amazon From Nov 2015 to March 2019."

good,Fun and fast work environment. Customer bosses company.You get to work on multiple projects with very intelligent individuals on a day to day basis. Overall a great experience.
good,"I’ve worked with a team of warehouse associate and leaders who are responsible for getting customers their orders. Responsibilities such as for ensuring the properly trained people needs are addressed so they can focus on the task at hand. My daily job duties are always focus on the safety of the associates, the quality of work, the customer experience, and productivity of my department. To do this I must review the work forecasts and determine the productivity requirements to produce during the day to meet the overall goal for the day/week/month. Balancing labor, ensuring that all tools and equipment work properly, Role modeling amazon’s leadership principals and Leading associates in outbound or inbound operations within the Fulfillment Center."
good,"I had learned the trade of becoming a delivery associate. I had worked ten hours per day, four days a week. "
good,"Enjoyed working there and getting all my jobs done trash removal "
good,"My experience at the Amazon Sort Center is RDU5 was fantastic! The environment is fast-paced and competitive. You move a lot - it was not uncommon to hit 35,000+ steps a day on my Fitbit. The managers are eager and aggressive and eager to promote as they need to build their team. The only reason I left is that I'm older (50+) with a family and the job schedule is a bit to get used to. You work 11.5 hours per day for three days a week and then 5.5 hours on another. My shift was Wednesday to Saturday I'd get to the site around 8am and get home around 8:30pm. If you're free of family constraints this job has a lot of upside - they want to grow from within and they're always willing to offer an opportunity to step. One piece of advice: You have to tell them you want to do it. They're not going to notice you from a far and say 'Hey want to lead?' You have to step up and let them know. Fantastic place and great team."
good,nice place to work at the environment is pretty good also the people there are friendly. very fast paced work you stay busy the whole time. they offer a lot of opportunity to grow and learn new things everyday.

good,"Every day at work, I would walk in and check what sorting position I would be assigned. This can vary from unloading packages, sorting packages by section on conveyor belt, etc. I learned how to efficiently manage dozens of packages as I sorted them for delivery. My co-workers were all friendly and enjoyed talking with them during snack breaks. The hardest part of the job was standing for extensive periods of time, but my  favorite part was organizing the packages for the truck delivery at the end of my shift."
good,Enjoyed my time with amazon. You always have something to do. The job benefits are excellent and the pay is good. Management is always looking for safety issues and they address concerns right away.

good,"Amazon if I have to rate it would be a medium, their are certain areas you get confused at, but all in all its a pretty good experience the only thing that people may have a problem with is the people there."
good,I worked from home through Amazon it was a great experience.m I would definitely recommend this remote position if you have children. It’s very convenient.
good,Ottimo lavoro soprattutto per chi e alla sua prima esperienza 👍
good,I was looking for a temporary position to increase my skills and to look for opportunities within and outside of the company. Amazon wants to give opportunities for personal growth in the communities that they offer employment in.
good,"Management was always willing to listen to someone's ideas or complaints and try to follow up on them. They encouraged people learning more than one job and there is a lot of room for growth. With a week of paid time off,two weeks of vacation, and two weeks of unpaid time off it is hard to get fired for attendance."
good,"One the greatest company of its work culture ,Management ,colleagues everything except salary because of the location I worked"
good,Regular packaging job consistent non stop prioritizing lifting palletize packages load and unload trucks sorting wrapping gifts lots of walking in some areas
good,"It is a great work place. "
good,Lil1 très bonne ambiance de travail. En sd il faut réussir à tenir 12h / jours mais la diversité du poste fais que le temps passe vite.
good,Mi sono trovata veramente bene peccato che non potevano farmi fissa ho imparato molto praticamente in tutti i reparti
good,I loved this job it was easy and I loved the people that worked there I felt comfortable and everyone there was treated fairly and I was well trained in what I am supposed to do
good,We can work without stress at amazon and I love working amazon not only a good place to work but also a very good place to learn new things everyday and your problem solving skills will get develop dsy by day.
good,"The problem with Amazon."
good,Great place to work and advance. The pay is good and the managers are very cooperative. They have good deals and low prices every day. Amazon is the best.
good,"Great Place to work."
good,"Great work system, I loved working for Amazon. I loved to work for Amazon because they are very open to ideas coming from the work force. The ability to grow within the company was also very good."
good,Una esperienza fantastica consiglio di provarci tutti specialmente chi e alla sua prima esperienza di lavoro
good,Good management good culture less pay.More pressure.growth is less.Take cares of employees.Had a lot of fun.shud increase the pay.If more people are employed the stress wud b less.
good,"fast face, keep on your toes, make sure you work within the safely, and make rate, drink plenty of water, wear the proper shoes, get plenty of rest. save your PTO and vacation"
good,Great place to work but quickly felt like a high school cafeteria.. The upper management is great but the PA's seem to abuse their positions quickly. Really made my time their amazing but very uncomfortable.
good,was a very great experience. Nice work environment loved working with the people the supervisor were great.  i really don't have much to say about this job. Didn't have a bad experience i guess.
good,"This makes for an easy way to make an additional income that doesn't require you to make too many changes to your life. Whenever you get free time, you can complete a task and generate income."
good,Managers did not listen and rarely came to your station to see if you had an decent amount of work and if you were waiting on work that would tack onto something called Time Off Task and will reflect badly on you and there is no way to get out of it
good,"It was unfortunate that it was a temporary job. The hours were great, people were great. Pay was amazing. We had a bank of hours that we could use to call in and be paid for."
good,As a seasonal delivery associate 90% of your day is spent inside a vehicle by yourself. You'r responsible for delivering all of you packages in your entire day. There are 2 paid 15 minute breaks and an unpaid 30 minute break. You are able to take your breaks when you choose. Perfect job if you don't mind driving and being alone.
good,Amazon is a great place to work if you don't mind being on your feet for 10 hours. The pay and benefits are a plus especially if you have children. 💘 it.
good,Amazon was a great business to help associates grow and accept more responsibilities as time went on. There were always loads of training opportunities and the work environment encouraged employees to have fun while at work by supplying calendar activities and free food and drink on occasion.
good,"I like the attention I get in the community. Everyone asks me Amazon questions. I wanted to work in a job where I didnt lay awake nights worrying about tomorrow.  I wanted a job that was free from the stress of undone issues, that carried over to the next day. I wanted to be around people but not close enough for them to know my personal business. Amazon has given me all of this.."
good,great place to work but no guarantee of job . superb work culture and everyone was very supportive . if I get an opportunity would again like to work with Amazon.
good,I always enjoyed going to work because they allowed pets/dogs and it was always fun to see the dogs running around. It was a High and fast paced environment where deadlines needed to be met each and every day.
good,"Has a permanent status rather than temporary as in agency."
good,"Talk about a place unlike any other!  Amazon is a massive incubator for startups and platforms to solve big customer and business challenges."
good,Its a great company to work. Great work life balance. Great to have stock option for a full time. Sometimes its feels like its too demanding. Offshore people needs to be more efficient
good,"There is the opportunity to move up as well as to transfer laterally, there is a willingness to train people to do a multitude of positions and it provides a wonderful physical workout."
good,It was an easy job when you got in the swing of things. It was easy to learn and I learned how to work hard and at the same time have fun doing it while also making friends.
good,Honestly working at Amazon yes was tiresome & daunting but I appreciate them so much. I took part in their career choice program while I worked for them & thanks to them they helped paid for some of my school. I will say that I worked at 2 locations. & My first building the overall encouragement & assistance from fellow co-workers was amazing the PA's at that location I felt knew more information than the area managers did which made doing our jobs slightly more difficult in case of problem & they definitely deserve a raise & HR was amazing. The location I transferred too because of proximity to my house was actually a mistake. My colleagues & HR at this location could be very rude but the area managers at this location were absolutely astounding & they made my job as a picker so much better. It's always hit or miss in general but for the most part Amazon really is a step up from most.
good,"Working in the amazon warehouse was very fast paced and required a lot of physical work. Overall the job was easy and very to the point, I knew of my job everyday and we all had to work together as a team to meet the quota for the day.  The hardest part of the job is just getting use to lifting the heavy packages and standing on your feet for 8 hours, after that it's smooth sailing."
good,"A typical day at Amazon is every day. Clock in, attend stand up and get to work. As routine as it sounds is as routine as it is. I learned a great deal at Amazon, I learned: to set and accomplish goals, how to focus on the task in front of me regardless of the noise or bodies around me and last, but not least i learned it all. Jumping to new departments every chance I got helped me to understand the complete order of operations. There is a high turn over rate for management there at that facility, I'm sure there is just reason, maybe just above my pay grade. The workplace culture was a life all itself. Some weeks i spent more time with those people then i did with any of the people in my own house. The hardest part of the job was... well... I guess staying on top of you flex bucket and the best part of the job was the different schedule options."
good,I liked working with amazon and more when you need a part time job or flexible job. Amazon is great for that. I really recommend it to anyone looking for a job that will work around your schedule
good,"Man legte sehr viel Wert auf Teamarbeit und Punktlichkeit, dies und die freundliche Arbeitsumgebung gefiel mir sehr."
good,"Ultra busy schedule but compensation is the best in the industry."
good,"We always have something new to learn, improve, create new ideas Amazon encourages employees with innovative thinking and rewards them, motivates,  help them achieve their goals, climp up high in their career."
good,"I was treated very well. Managers were friendly. Very positive atmosphere. We exercised as a group before we began each shift. Each day you were trained to work different positions of the warehouse. Inbound, Outbound, Scanners, Pallet Wrappers, Pallet Movers, Big and Oversize Orders, Problem Solve, Gaylord. This helped you to learn the full production of the warehouse. I enjoyed working as a Pallet Wrapper, Pallet Mover and Problem Solve."
good,Very good company to work for. Very structured and management supported in the position as Onsite Medical Representative. Management very receptive to new ideas and input.
good,A typical day at work was pretty fun. There are many people with different backgrounds. The age range was expansive but the majority of people were in there 20s. This job is a great summer job. Amazon does a great job to hear the voices of the associates. Safety is their #1 priority. I had a great experience there.
good,It was a very good experience. The work responsibilities were very easy. You had 3 breaks during your shift. The rate of pay is very good. It is an excellent company to work for overall.
good,i like working at amazon because the people was friendly and the money was good and they had a bus to take you to the job so it was good and the warehouse was clean and tardy
good,It is completely necessary to double time it through the day. The only things that really matter to management are safety and rate. If you work fast and follow every rule you will be fine.
good,"I worked there as a warehouse associate "
good,"Great work from home job. Training is 6 weeks long. They send you the equipment to use, just have to provide the internet. There is always a manager around to help out if you have questions."
good,"Pay could be a little better than 15 a hour given the CEO is “The richest man alive.” There are pay incentives, however, they seem to be dying down and recently I’ve heard they will be completely extinct."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. You have excellent benefits and more time off than any other job you will ever work. I miss the time off. I miss the fast pace. I would go back in a heartbeat if I went directly into HR.
good,"I’ve been working for Amazon for almos 4 years. I have nothing wrong to say about it. It’s true that amazon is not for everyone, you have to work hard, but benefits and compensation are good."
good,Great place to work with good benefits. Less opportunity to grow but has a well structured plan for those without an associate degree that pays up to 90% of your tuition.
good,"I loved working at Amazon. It was my first time to work in a warehouse and I fell in love with it! It is a fast paced job, but sometimes it had its slow days. I could wear whatever I wanted as long as I wore a vest. I love working at a fast pace because it keeps me busy and not bored! Time goes by fast working at Amazon!"
good,"Remember ....its a 12hr standing job."
good,"Shifts are 4 hours at a time, maximum of 5 and a minimum of 3. You will be able to choose between unloading trucks, wrapping pallets, scanning boxes, or moving pallets once you are taught these tasks. Breaks are 15 minutes."
good,It is a Very active job ! You’Ol  Need to be able to walk all your shift under weather conditions. Remember you have to work in a wearhouse where AC is not an option
good,"I really enjoyed working for Amazon when they opened in Oklahoma City.  This was prior to the pay raises for everybody but I left due to the low pay and hours (I worked overnight) but I would gladly go back now that the pay is where it should be.  It’s not like you hear about online, people work and talk with people around them. They get work done and still have a good time."
good,Great company to work for and grow within. They will work with you and show you if you have never worked there before. And there is always something new to do
good,My work as a consultant at Amazon was only 7 months however during that time frame I really enjoyed working there. The people and the culture was amazing! I would definitely recommend working there!
good,Some of the best people work at Amazon; hardworking and fun-loving. If you like dogs you can bring your dog to work.  Multi-cultural atmosphere which I loved and opportunities to grow in your career abound.
good,It was extremely fast paced especially on holidays. The atmosphere was great and the managers are wondeful. The hardest thing was the freezer and competing for hours.
good,Amazon prime now ready is a good place to work and they have a flexible schedule. It's a fast paced environment that keeps you in the move & busy. Probably a great choice for students.
good,"Nothing negative to say.  Management is responsive, helpful, pleasant, and sincerely encourages personal and professional growth.  Training is very thorough, well formatted, and provides a team building environment."
good,"I enjoyed working there, if there was a job opening I would definitely go back. The people there were friendly and it challenged me to be a better worker than before."
good,Not long enough time to relax. To stick on break time.  Not enough hard workers.  Management not on same page. Won't allow light duty for medical reasons.
good,Amazon taught me a lot especially my managers . I didn’t like how our supervisor trained new people like myself . They would scream and make fun of people . Amazon Taught me that your going to have to work with people you don’t like but while your at work remain humble and try to have fun working . I’m thinking about going back to school soo I can be a operation manager.
good,Excellent benefits for part-time work. A typical day at work can be nice and rewarding but worker must keep their mind on their assignments and put safety first every day. I enjoy the two breaks as well as the lunch break. Friendly environment to work in and can be very busy during prime week. Staying focus and improving on learned task is enjoying.
good,didn't  like the bosses they had big problems took it out on employees and they were always rushing everything even our breaks trying to make you hurry to get back to the floor
good,"A typical day is 10 hour shifts. Perfect hours. good money."
good,Overall it was a great experience. Not too hard just the right amount of easiness. I’ve learned about barcodes which I did not know about. The bag thing was just getting sore and your feet hurting. I really enjoyed the people I met. They were really nice
good,It is a quick pace environment. The pay is good with a comprehensive benefits package. The only downside I have found was that managers tend to be a little hands off but will always take the time to help you if you need it.
good,"Bell'esperienza lavorativa, ambiente stimolante giovane e dinamico"
good,Consiglierei L esperienza in Amazon fortifica il mondo della logistica il futuro è nelle loro mani colosso aziendale indissolubile
good,Work environment is very laid back. Management is awesome. They help you with whatever is needed. The people I work with are very nice as well.Awesome workplace so far.
good,The company takes great care of their employees makes them feel appreciated with free water food snacks shirts and gift cards. Appreciate not being micromanaged
good,"Friendly environment but long hours and tedious work. Pay is good , management is accommodating but hours are too long. If you are okay with standing in one spot for at least 10 hours this will be perfect for you"
good,Amezon is the best company in the world and I have 3 month pack  expression in amezon brand this is very good compnay I like this I wish once more work at amezon
good,I work graveyard shift on the weekends in order to get that extra dollar. There's some cool coworkers. Anybody whom says Amazon is hard probably doesn't perform their tasks right or at all.
good,"Each day began with team meeting which outliers and accomplishments, mapping the day ahead. Wonderful place to learn how to work together and very transparent to how each function/role contributes to the business as a whole."
good,se aprende mucho y el ambiente laboral muy bueno siempre
good,"I loved it, very competitive. Loved my Packing section everyday was never a dull day, especially when we had them days during peak time. Peak times are the best to get the most hours."
good,"A typical day at amazon is fast paced, with tons of energized people ready to work. With that type of energy it makes you want to worker harder at you job."
good,My shift is until 2am. They are Pacific time so be aware of the time difference. It's been a nice place to work. A little demanding as far as time limits but a lot of help when you need it.
good,"The managers have no idea who I am in a team of 40 people.  The other facility, the managers took time to know all of their employees and we would have 100+ on a shift."
good,"I was a bit nervous to work in a warehouse because most of my background consisted of working at ""desk jobs"" however my facility in Rosemead, CA was very supportive. I worked part-time Friday-Monday which gave me time to do things outside of work. Management was supportive and they made it clear that if we ever had issues with coworkers or management we could report it. My position did require a lot of labor however the company provides a 15-minute break and they provide water and occasionally ice cream to the employees. Worker safety is a big concern!  I also love how inclusive this organization is, I worked with some co-workers who were deaf so every morning this organization would skype in an interpreter to give those employees a rundown of our tasks today. There is also a lactating room for women who are nursing! "
good,"In amazon, it's good place to work, you learn lot of new things and meet new people but i recommend not to work through agency they could kick you out and ask you to work more hours."
good,"10am-8:30 pm shift. Day starts with coffee and a morning meeting. Supervisors hand out routes, you grab your van, load it up and head out. Package delivery quota is 15 per hour which is easily achievable but if you want to deliver all of your parcels (anywhere between 150-200) you need to move at a steady pace. I always have time for a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks. Deliver, refuel, and head home. It’s fast paced but fun."
good,"I learned that i could push myself to the limits. Also, it gave me the opportunity to use communication skills, to interact with a different cultures."
good,"Great company to work for, a little bit of a work/life imbalance.  but overall absolutely great place to work. 10/10 would recommend Amazon to anyone."
good,Très agréable ainsi que le système du magasin et sa fonctionaliter.
good,Amazon was pretty cool to work at. Met a lot of excellent people and I'm still friends with some of them. My managers were understanding with any problems and always motivated me to do my best.
good,"I liked the work Amazon hard work and funny "
good,"good company with good wages. good benefits. good environment."
good,A typical work day included packing boxes as fast as you can and as safely as you can. Hardest part was that there would sometimes be heavy cages the you have to pull.
good,Amazon is great with their pay and benefits. It was a fun environment where the employees had the ability to manage their own days. The only downside was that you had to relocate in order to be promoted.
good,"My Opinion And Experience With Amazon, Is Very Unpredictable But Worth The Money You Make And The Pay Raises Are Incredible. They Offer Over Time And Lots Of Other Awesome Benefits And You Can Work Your Way Up So There Is Room For Advancement."
good,"It was a great opportunity to work for this company. Nice experience, easy going work place and peaple. Liked the time I spent working there. You can work part time or full time, and you can do over time if its  available.Didn't like that it had to end. But would  not mind working there again."
good,Easy workplace. Wish they would let me branch out to what i want to actually do and show them what skills i have as a software developer. Then train me on what i don't know.
good,"The pay was good and guaranteed more than enough hours to sustain you, on your feet for hours but definitely worth it in the end, free coffee and hot chocolate too"
good,"Good culture robust great place for a fresher"
good,amazon is a great place to work the only thing is how they give to out hours it should be set schedules instead of picking and racing to get shifts it can be hard to get shifts.
good,"ICQA ., destroy log, shipping, auditing,  friendly,   shipping, stowing, packing, if you did not  meet your numbers, you were talked to  by management"
good,Working there was challenging at first but fun and competitive. Management was very involved with helping you reach your goal and allowed to try different areas of work.
good,"to work at Amazon you have to be a person with a great attitude and with strength, a lot of physical work but is worth it... and you can advanced with time which ia good"
good,"When you work here you are moving constantly until your break time. While it may seem like a lot of work, or a very fast paced hurried operation at first, once you are paired off with your partner for that days shift it’s quite easy to acclimate to the demands and become a competitive worker. On top of this your down time is worked in such a way that you can genuinely relax without the stress of what work waits for you after break time is over."
good,"Day shift "
good,"I love the fact that once hired by Amazon, your work schedule remains the same....I can always make any plans without thinking I will receive a late night phone call asking am I available to work on my day off."
good,as long as you dont get lost and are very fast and can take standing on your feet not too bad. I got lost quite often which made me late back for break which I did not think was fair.
good,I learned a lot about the warehouse business and all of the work that goes into the distribution of products to customers all over the world and how important the job of a warehouse associate is.
good,Friendly environment excellent benefits and pay. The leadership is most encouraging and help us stay on track to get the job done. They also give out prizes and buy us lunches and snacks near holidays and when we meet goals set.
good,I was stressed a lot here. Quota for each day changed and they wanted to much work out of me I was there for almost 2 years. I wasn't able to move up much in this company.
good,Best job if you don't get hired to be let go at the end of the season. The managers are great and the community is great and combined with the fair labor and its a great job.
good,"My typical day at work is clock in, exercise, then scan packages and put them into a crate.  There is music being played so the workers don't fall asleep.  Lunch is 30 minutes and we have one 15 minute break."
good,The work environment is fast paced. Everyone is accountable for their personal stats for the day. There is a lot of lifting required and awareness is important.
good,"After reading a few other reviews I don't think amazon are given the credit where its due. Seems to me, either they are aware of the negative opinions and have improved where necessary, or some of these reviews are slightly negative."
good,"All inclusive management environment. Great variety within the workforce: age, experience, multi-cultural, multi-racial. The management team is flexible, encouraging, and knowledgeable."
good,Its a good job just not enough hours to make a living on it. The work is easy to handle but the hours is a problem. Also the will layoff most the people after Christmas time.
good,I have had amazing three years with Amazon. The experience gained here will last with me forever. I had great to work with and a friendly atmosphere got to learn many things from my team and the managers I worked with. Happy to be part of Amazon.
good,"Amazon is a great opportunity to lose weight, stay active and receive great benefits. It also gives opportunity to grow and move up but you have to put in the work to do so."
good,For any one wanting to work for Amazon be prepare for all lot of work at a fast pace. Trust me on this. But it fun if you have people there you can laugh and joke with.
good,"Amazon.in is a great company to start your carrier with since beginners are nurtured here."
good,"I currently work in a data department as an analyst. What I love the most about my job is that amazon innovates in the work environment. My job can be sub-divided between working at home (where I can stay and control my time and be with my family) and working at the site where I can work on other projects besides my normal work shift."
good,Meet up at designated location have a brief meeting with group. Get your delivery truck meet up at wearhouse. Load up and began your deliveries. if your self motivated you'll be a great fit
good,Enjoy my job.  Customers first outbound boxes ensure quality if I wouldn't like it I take it to problem solve.  Fun place to work.  Hard on the feet though. Lol
good,"I'm a problem solver so it's busy and that's what I like about it, trying to find out what the ptoblem with the packages that come in with no destination."
good,A typical day for me was getting my job assignment loading my rack and  staging it in the area where the van driver can get its loading It all depend what shift you work different shift do different thing sometime we have to load the van. Then we have cars come on a another shift I assist with loading there vehicle. If things slow down I would help other department and go help out and I would go on the outside and gather racks it depend on what days you work some supervisor were better than other but all and all they were good to work for the hardest part of the job was to me was gather racks because you only have so much time to finish your order and have to go and find a racks. What I enjoy was the people they were really friendly
good,Good working condition and cooperative teammates. Managers are always helping. Goodwork culture and will rewarded for better work. Benefits will provided for flexible hard working employees.
good,Work culture at Amazon is great.  Comfortable working at this place. A fresh and energetic environment all over the company. Facilities provided are good.
good,"Very fast pace, overall good job, good exercise, and great way to meet other employees to get more information on advancing within the company. Everyone is very helpful."
good,"Overall it's a good place to work with both good benefits and paid time off."
good,Amazon was a good and fun place to work. Have to work fast and keep up your numbers up. Management works with you if you don't meet the rate per hour.
good,I enjoy working at Amazon and have met some of the nicest people.  The supervisors are all extremely supportive and don't mind helping out.  The co workers are amazing and the atmosphere is great.
good,I worked for amazon for 1.5 years and only left because I needed too much time off due to family obligations. They are incredibly accommodating and generous with time off.
good,This is a good company to work for especially warehouse work. Company is pretty strict but a good easy work invirement. Very good benefits insurance but you will never know when u would be laid off this is a very good start for anyone who's attending college or fresh out of High school but not for a long term careers.
good,"I loved working for Amazon in Middletown, but if they had offered a shuttle that would pick us up to and fro I probably would still be working for the company"
good,"I have been in operations for 13 years and Amazon is by far the best place I’ve worked at thus far. The culture fosters a great learning environment, team work, and you cannot really beat the benefits offered for full time employees. It is not a cut throat environment, the pace is much slower than other operations I’ve worked at, less stress and low pressure; this may be different for associates and those who work on the line."
good,"very good and on time for all services, never any issues and if any issue they were taken care of fast and effectively in a timely manner. I would recommend amazon.com to everyone"
good,I love working for them good caring people and they are willing to help and leand if needed. Only problem is the long walks u have to do but it’s really good exercise it you look at it.
good,"The Position I hold is Device Associate, the growth here is too low on the professional side"
good,"Intensive and fast-paced during the working hours, but no time is wasted. Innovation announced each week, and require to learn new systems and ways to do things every day."
good,By far best company I've ever worked for. The management is very involved and helpful to agents. The team atmosphere is really enjoyable because it makes you feel as though you are not working alone because you are always with a wonderful team.
good,My days at work were very productive. The hardest park was all the extra orders that would need t be dealt with right away. the most enjoyable part was
good,Working at amazon taught me a lot of different things. time management and production was important at the job but so was the employees health. They provided stand ups for all shifts to have a break down of the day/night as well as stretches.
good,"Amazon although with long working hours, keeps everyone busy with a constant work load and giving prizes to people who have stood out from the rest, and with occasional events such as bingo, races, etc,"
good,Uma empresa que sempre incentiva o funcionario a querer crescimento. Da suporte para aprendizagem e tem um otimo relacionamento quando se trata do trabalho em equipe.
good,"So far my experience with Amazon is concern,  this is something new to me and different,  there is lot to learn,  different techniques,fast pace job k"
good,Amazon was a cooperative group effort to fulfill the demand by its customers on a daily basis. It was fast paced and had a very driven environment. Management was great and very hands on.
good,I enjoyed my time working for Amazon as a seasonal worker. I wish that I would’ve been given thre opportunity to stay on and join the team. I enjoyed the fast pace of scanning and the relaxed and safe environment
good,"Typical work day for my contract-to-hire position was a 4 hour day of hustle and bustle. Definitely kept me active and the pay was decent. The culture was very relaxed but could become stressful depending on the inflow of packages. Management was ok, the managers would rotate shifts every 6 weeks or so, I started with a great manager, however when the rotation came around, our shift was given a brand new manager who was not honest with us. She would flat-out tell us lies about our numbers for the day or withhold information that we definitely deserved to know. Overall, my experience at Amazon was positive and I would recommend this job to anyone looking for some extra money and willing to put in a little muscle and effort."
good,Great working independent. Some routes paid less than their worth. Lots of driving management was fair to all employees. Enjoyed weekly compensation which allowed me to pick up additional routes.
good,Amazon focuses on team work! The culture is amazing and a great environment for growth from within! Highly motivated and enthusiastic leadership teams make the days worth while!
good,"As a flex driver, you get the privilege of choosing which days and times you would like to work in relation to the available blocks of time Amazon has available. Just because you decide to work one day versus another, doesn't necessarily mean you will be able to pick up a block of delivery time. Otherwise, when you are able to, the warehouse employees are great, although there seems to be far too many of them at any given time during the day. Delivery itself is easy if you can follow a GPS"
good,"Management is fairly responsive, folks are trained well and given options for growth. It never really gets boring and things are always evolving. The culture is easy going and folks generally are comfortable and happy with their job.  Pay is fair and schedules are well suited for folks who have busy weekends."
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon and would rehire in I needed to."
good,Enjoyed the fast paced teamwork.  Opportunities to pick up extra hours.  Friendly and interactive of management and the supervisors with the employees.  Safety exercises before the start of shifts.
good,"Great learning experience, co-workers helped a lot. Management was a plus, hours where great. type of work was very interesting, time off was perfect for my personal life."
good,"Every morning you come in to a meeting that sets the tone for the day. You are assigned where to go and your work day is fairly straight forward."
good,amazon was a great job for almost anyone very simple duties lots of overtime during the holidays i liked it ! manager were also ok there is favoritism because they are friends but didnt bother me i just did my work.
good,"Working for Amazon was one of the great achievements. A typical day at work, handling phones, resolving customer issues over the phone and through the software designed to resolve customer issues was just one of its own and assisting customers from America and around the world was a bonus, you get to learn so much, from attitudes to behaviors and how one can handle people who vary so much in our cultures. The hardest part of the job is dealing with old people. It's not even hard but time consuming as one needs to assist these old people no matter the fact that they cannot use a computer but as a company that is customer centric one needs to ensure that the customer issue is resolved. The most enjoyable and motivating part is that the workplace offers skills, one is given a skill based on their abilities."
good,"Buen empleo. Trabajo fuerte, Buenos supervisores, Se requiere de mucha serenidad, ya que el trabajo llega un momento que es extresante. Es recomendable utilizar faja, Ya que se carga mucho peso."
good,"Quando ho lavorato da Amazon mi sono trovato in un buon ambiente di lavoro, socievole ,dinamico e collaborativo."
good,Company tried to make it fun for employees. Working for Amazon Logistics is definitely more satisfying than customer service. If you can take the angry customers then it is really a rewarding job.
good,Filosofia aziendale stimolante per chi vuole crescere sotto l'aspetto della gestione delle risorse aziendali.
good,"I enjoyed working with Amazon. Training is paid, your manager and higher ups are always available for questions. I worked from home and scheduled my own hours so it was based around my life. Weekly minimum hours is set however."
good,"I've interviewed people recently and they asked me ""You've been at amazon 7 years, what keeps you?"" I think the reason is I have been able to create myself every couple years. I love that. I've learned more in 7 years than I could have ever learned in a typical university."
good,The best place to learn and have fun at the same time. Helpful and friendly colleagues. Amazing work culture and very good training. Endless potential for growth.
good,"Amazon is a fast paste casual work place, Will not work for everyone. Good pay and benefits if you are a full time employee.? Worse place to work if you are lazy and none punctual?"
good,Enjoyed working at a fast pace and always learning something new. The dress code was relaxed and the job itself was easy to learn. I will say the lunch breaks could have been longer.
good,"As  a manager, my day consisted of meetings, Checking in on associates. Answering emails. Establishing and updating metrics. Planning for increased improvements."
good,è un posto di lavoro in cui bisogna darsi da fare ma che riconosce il lavoro svolto. la sicurezza è prioritaria
good,I loved amazon I cannot wait to go back ! It’s easy and the pay is great ! The managers I had no longer work there which is a plus ! Because I had a hard time getting grievance when I NEEDED IT .
good,It was a fun environment to work in. We learnt something new daily on the job. Acquired and sharpen most of my technical knowledge and skills regarding computers on the job. Very educational and challenging job. Taught us to think on our feet and own each call. There was no escalation team at the time.
good,Amazon is a metrics-driven company that rewards based on merit. Put in what you would like to receive. My managers have helped me grow into new opportunities throughout the warehouse and I have enjoyed the challenge the logistics side has brought.
good,Loved working there had a great time work there and you can move up to a different postion! Always having events in the work place to make things less stressful!
good,Amazon was a relaxed but fast working environment that offers alot of different things and tools for you to be successful while working there. It is a great place to work for and i would recommend it to everyone.
good,I enjoyed every minute working for Amazon! Wish I could’ve stayed longer but I had to move away. It was fun & I had a very manageable work space. Apply apply apply !
good,"we have a safety brief every day, and practice safety rules. Its a quick changing environment but your leaders are their every step of the way. I highly recommend it."
good,Working for amazon in Maintenance is an easy laid back environment. It is any maintenance man's dream retirement job. There are so many rules and safety standards it makes it difficult to complete your job without going through a ton of paperwork. Tools are provided. You have assigned PMs to complete for the day. You aren't under too strict of management. Not a bad gig at all and the pay and benefits are decent.
good,"Fun environment working with many young people, mostly students. "
good,The pay is great the work is easy the management is friendly u receive great benefits they show u appreciation I liked it here. I will go back if I had the transportation
good,"I loved working at Amazon. The work is physical but doable, kind of like a workout , a 10 hour workout lol. I very much enjoyed working there as a seasonal associate and i gave it my best for the hope of getting hired on . I was known as a white badge like many of my other co-workers and that basically means you can easily be replaced at any given moment. The goal is to become a blue badge. Me and many of my co-workers gave it our all to earn a blue badge and stay at the company but as soon as seasonal was over we got the boot. I understand that that is the nature of the business we got hired as seasonal and i am thankful to have worked there but can Amazon turn around and be more considerate with the employees that help to make Amazon what it is. Many of my co-workers including myself also have dreams and goals that we want to achieve. Achieving said dreams many times requires steady employment like putting a roof over my head for me. Our dreams require money to cover our most basic needs and with very much difficulty anything we can save gets us a little closer to our dreams. I think Amazon and other companies that had a vision and achieved their dreams should thank the people down here at the bottom that helped carry the weight of said dreams on our backs to the top. I would still work at Amazon if given the opportunity even if it means i get continually laid off ,because i believe in Amazon and I believe that there is hope and changes can be made that are beneficial to all involved with Amazon. Amazon you are a very powerful company please attempt to get to know the little"
good,I really enjoy working at amazing but unfortunately i need to work more hours . I’m only working part time at amazing and hopefully I can get more hours somewhere else .
good,"Excellent work enviroment and culture. Lots of oppurtunites to develop and learn new skills. No micro management and stress."
good,Every day was a great day there. Never had any issues. Incredibly helpful management and staff. Fast paced work daily with high goals for each employee but never unreasonable.
good,I recommend Amazon if you want a job with great benefit m. Its challenging but once u get used to it you will be fine. I worked with a lot of awesome managers and Leads. FTW6 is very neat and clean they put safety 1st as a PRIORITY. Will like to go back there to FTW6
good,"It is good to work at amazon. I want to work with customer servive. I need 40 hour per week. Looking to use my skills with customer service. "
good,It was agreat time. I had a lot of fun working there. It made time g by super fast. I enjoyed the people I had to work with. The job was very fast paced which I loved and very much enjoyed.
good,"I really loved working at amazon. I have been employed there 3 times and have thoroughly enjoyed working there. The place is not for the wimps!  Although there are very lazy people there, there are also some extremely hard workers. Respect is earned by your peers understand that going in. Nobody cares about your education level just what you can produce."
good,"I had flexible shifts, worked for 8 hours. I learned teamwork and management skills. The management was fantastic. Work culture was nice, you enjoyed while working."
good,"I was with Amazon TRMS Bangalore for 10 months, I was part of BRI where every day is a new day with respect to the cases you work on. Amazon provides you with the opportunity of making work life better by bringing process changes. You work hard, you grow with the company."
good,"Many employees can work when and as often as they want.  Entry level employee make $15/hour minimum.  Management gives away Amazon Alexa, Nintendo Wii, and big screen TVs as motivational prizes among other incentives for performance or attendance."
good,I love it there I have worked seasonal at amazon for the past four years and I have always enjoyed my shifts because they let us choose our days and hours so what more could you ask for?
good,"Working in the warehouse was mixed; some days, it was hard and intense, while being chill and relaxed on others. They show you how to do basically everything, as you'll be doing different tasks throughout your shift. The people there are amazing when you get to know them well enough."
good,"Can't move up unless you know the right people, other than that benefits and pay are great and you get to meet other great people, which you can only talk to on your breaks"
good,"The job itself is very solitary, due to the large, fast-paced scale of Amazon. If you do everything asked of you, efficiently, you will never have to talk to a manager. Boring and quiet, but simple."
good,"Fun fast pace nothing bad about working here, well fast paced work with some competition got to hit ylur numbers or youll be talled to then if it continues youll be written up."
good,"Very good  job and  company is good  so i have need  a job so please i have admitted. Amazon is best indian online shopping and working company. "
good,"Fun Atmosphere,the managers are real down to earth and they have alot of patience and are very understanding...the days go fast and we often get a surprise lunch and doughnuts"
good,Management there is good they help you with anything you need. They help great with fixing your schedule for school. overall staff and coworkers are great fun and help you when you are stuck.
good,"I Loved my job and want to go back. it was fun being on a team , yes yes yes yes yes yes great place to work fun place to work yes yes yes oh yes oh ."
good,"Start time was always on point, learned many different forms of packing, loading, staging for route set up. Management were cool as well as involved with all levels of workers, workplace culture was fantastic, hardest part of the job was clean up and setting up for next shift, most enjoyable part of the job was just going in to work."
good,Great place to work. A  typical day is very routine in each department. A job is based on performance which can be extremely unfair. The work culture is relaxed and upscaled. The hardest part of the job is making rate on days when you are not at your best performance. The most enjoyable part of the job is making rate which you are performing at your hight potential!!!
good,"State of the art equipment gives you ample opportunity to work hands on with some of the latest technology in warehouse automation."
good,I loved my time here at Amazon I wish I didn't have to move I woould have stayed forever! The workplace was the best I have ever endured. the staff and manaagement was amazing.
good,"Working at Amazon can have a positive impact on individual's learning and does help you grow both personally and professionally."
good,"Dobrá práce, vrátil bych se spět na pozici marshala i poznat jinné pozice."
good,"okc5 is not your average place. they are laid back and ready to have a blast but still responsible & driven to be the best, because they are the best!"
good,Low stress and easy going work place environment. Work is not physically demanding on a person's body. There is a positive attitude from management to employees.
good,"Amazon was an amazing job, I just had a lot of unforeseen circumstances to come up during my time at amazon and that is why i had to depart from Amazon. Ultimately i would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"You can determine your success. Customers are the number one priority and continuously looking for process improvement. Great pay and benefits. Employees safety and job satisfaction was always a top management concern. Good working conditions, but not wasting resources on things that don't benefit the customer experience. Excellent use of technology to manage performance."
good,"This was a crazy fast paced job with a wide variety of people that called in on a regular basis.   The job was never boring,  always provided a challenge to provide quick service while keeping the customer on the phone happy.  The best part of the job was when your day was over,  the job was over with no stress to carry over to the next day."
good,"lavoro su turni ma per niente stressante, ambiente di lavoro fantastico e gestione degli spazi aziendali ottimi ."
good,Acredito que a Amazon é uma empresa que oportuniza pessoas através de oportunidades aos cidadãos de diversas partes do Planeta!
good,"a typical day is long and fast paced, tiring. and great experience making sure that Amazon customers get the packages, and that they enjoy the customer experience"
good,"Good environment to work in , there are quite a few benefits as well. "
good,"Flexible management, good benefits, advancement opportunities. As an upcoming graduate I've found their support towards students very useful as well.  I worked in a Customer Service call center."
good,"- work hard, have fun, make history"
good,A typical day working at Amazon is coming in clock in stretch get your device and get your section and being to work. Working at Amazon Ive learned that working as a team is very important.
good,Was fun and good place to work with.. learned many things and was like a second home for me. And the work itself was fun back then in TRMS.. where it shows how important is one’s role in preventing fraud and checking the legitimacy of transactions.
good,"Great pay, 4 days on and 3 days off. "
good,"Productivity is a vital source in continuim of employement, the faster the better consistently. The management is very supportive in suggestive measures to improve."
good,"Elite leaders and processes.  Loved the people and loved the endless opportunities to develop.  Travel is required for all managers which helps forge new, indelible relationships.  Great place to initiate one’s career in logistics, management, and/or transportation.  Hours are long and productive, as required.  Wish only the best for new employees!"
good,"Personally, I loved my Job."
good,use to be a picker then I went to the ship dock was doing tdr load trucks and drive the folk lift . I didn't like to pick cuz I walk to many miles feet use be sure.. had fun driving the forklift fast and I loved my cowokers
good,Azienda all’avanguardia sulla sicurezza e nell’orgaNizzazione del lavoro
good,"Lots of opportunity, and many people move frequently from one position to the next.  Ideal for the person who embraces constant change and flux with working contacts.  With the rapid growth and addition of business segments, many positions are rotated in 2 years or less."
good,Never get too comfortable. Always try to improve and makes sure never to leave your badge at home. Arrive on-time and get bonuses. The overall experience is good though. The people will make you comfortable. Just don't be lazy or carefree.
good,"Very productive and technology advanced place filled with amazing hard working people. Although it is a great job with many benefits and positions to gain higher pay, just like any other warehouse job, it is not for everyone."
good,"I learned to multi-talk, I also got to meet many of people. The hardest part of the job was when things are behind, it makes your job a lot harder which can mentally drain someone but I learned to come up with my own route so I won't become mentally drained,stressed,BODY PAIN,etc. It was such a great experience and i would recommend someone to try it!"
good,I was always busy always had something to do and there was always more work to get done my co-workers were normally always friendly and laid back there was no pressure unforced upon worked but all worker's knew what was expected of them by the end of every shift of every day
good,"Required to come in early in ,most departments to place employees in their prospective jobs for the day."
good,It was a great experience and not at all a stressful job to work at Amazon and had a beautiful work culture for the employees. Every day thought me something new in the organisation.
good,A great place to work. Starting at the bottom/entry position is incredibly hard and frustrating. If you start to promote the opportunities really start to open up. You will learn more at amazon then any other employer.
good,Me gustó trabajar ahí pero no se casan con nadie no dan estabilidad.
good,"Fast paced, 100% on feet, attention to detail will help insure you continued employment. If you struggle, there is a standard policy/procedure before discharged. This helps some, as the time frame will keep you working. Although, the timeframe is cut back during holiday season, in an effort to insure accuracy for order fulfillment."
good,"Wish I still worked here, I enjoyed it! Great atmosphere and easy work. Loved talking to the customers. I enjoy helping others. Wasn't always the nicest customers but most understood."
good,"Really enjoyed the work"
good,"Gostei muito da minha experiência na empresa,  em que pese o momento instável no setor de transportes, pois que muito me ajudou a desenvolver meus objetivos."
good,It was very fun to work at amazon but since it was temporary since it was just holiday service. It could be busy at times and slow at others but overall it was fast paced
good,"It was very fast paced but as long as your rate was above 100%, the managers wouldn't bother you. The lunch breaks were an hour long and we also had two 15 minute breaks."
good,"I spent 11 months working for this company and i enjoyed my time there. There were issues with the front half of the week management playing favorites, but after my departure most were released. They have a great training program and i would for sure go back if i was given the chance."
good,"Job is great. Fulfillment is much different than Amazon.com. Important to have a clear expectation from the beginning. Most hourly workers have a 2 year path and tools available to get where they need to go, but entry level fulfillment will not bring long term fulfillment. It's a process."
good,good to learn and good environment to work .Tough too regain your stability .And good to earn about life and work and workplace is good and learning experience is good
good,"Great company to work for, they treated you with respect and have decent benefits .. They have challenges that allow companies to grow and succes which is a good opportunity to be promote as a better spot where you can transfer to another facilities"
good,lots of opportunity for professional growth . good management. shift flexibility. good work environment around coworkers. not micromanaged. but encouraged to be better daily.
good,"The job can be stressful but offers a great balance and benefits. As an OMR you offer first aide and consultation to associates , life threatening injuries or illness are rare but do happen."
good,I loved the job but they vould pay more money to make the people work even harder and to show they are valued at the company.They make so much money that even a little more to the employees would matter
good,"I was excited to work for Amazon because I always shop there, so it was exciting to actually work at the warehouse and see first hand who packages are put together and shipped out"
good,the reason why I was fired from there was because I was way too slow but other than that I did enjoy working there. other than that the people are really nice there the managers do care unlike some of the other distribution centers in the U.S.
good,"Great company to work for, with great benefits and work culture. The competition within the work culture inspires growth within the company. Although there's long days but it compensates with three days off.Always assured a 40 hour week. Expect to lift boxes or containers on a daily bases and would not recommend if you have some kind of health or body injury."
good,"i always made my day good "
good,its a good place to work but after the holiday season there is no work there is  always vto and they give it to people sometimes without asking for it
good,Not a bad place to work. Would recommend it to others. Managers are great. Difficult to move up. Can be very tedious at times. Not for everyone. Benefits are great.
good,"Easy work, great staff. Must be used to a 4 day on 3 day off schedule.  Odd shift hours may apply. Must be able to work in hot weather as well as lift up to 50 lbs"
good,I was happy!! very happy!. I was good at what i do and very good at customer service. The training we went through helped a lot. It helps to understand what your job requires from you
good,"Every morning and after lunch there would be a meeting,then we would stretch, walk rapidly to first, second, or third floors."
good,"Amazon can be a fun and cool place to work, because you are constantly moving around and have people to talk to. The dress code is relaxed and causal; and for the most part, management is okay."
good,"Amazon offers a ton of at home or remote jobs for their customer service positions and honestly, I think it's a great idea.  It can be difficult to stay on track if you don't make the right place and time to work.  It was really neat learning more about the company and how all the processing works.  I was pregnant at the time and had a few customers make me cry, but other than that I'd recommend them as a place to work."
good,"The company sets a reasonable goal for productivity, breaks with snacks or a meal on rare occasion, benefits are spectacular. The retirement package and stocks are a nice add on as well."
good,"it was a great place to work for, everyone was friendly and polite, lots of overtime, breaks were on time, movement was encouraged, never felt like i was doing bad."
good,"Loved working here, everyone got along and time flew by fast at work. Hoping that you guys get an Amazon in the Norfolk Virginia area to help college students with funding for college"
good,"Amazon was great last i was there, such that i find it quite hard to note any drawbacks to working there."
good,"Workplace culture is the best. "
good,"Its good exercise and its fast paced work so the day fly by.  You start out by exercising then you go scan packages for 2 hours or so, take a 10 minute break, go back to scanning packages and then go home."
good,"The owner of Amazon is great! Managements isn’t so great, most actually favoritism many people and let them get away with things they shouldn’t have let get away with but hey that’s every work place I been too."
good,"Aprendi a trabajar en aquipo ya que poseen una cultura laboral muy divertida con constantes ideas de mejora."
good,"I enjoy how fast paced this job is because time goes by faster and there is always something to do.  A typical work day includes a team meeting, two breaks and a lunch.  The same task is done all day, but it seems fast because of the pace."
good,"Ottimo lavoro e ambiente lavorativo. Faticoso ma piacevole il rapporto con i clienti. Difficile riuscire a far capire al cliente che certe cose non si possono proprio accordare. Piacevole il rapporto con i clienti, il rapporto con i colleghi e i manager, il luogo in cui si lavora."
good,"I love working at Amazon. Management is always involved and actually know my name and treat me with respect. I have learned so many different aspects of the job I had no idea what was all involved"
good,"Good job, company, culture and people.  It was a lot of fun,  but also really hard work.  It's very repetitive and could use more position diversity.  I would work there again."
good,Day at Amazon started with the thought of how to gain customer and retain his trust here with us at Amazon. I've learned how to deal with different kinds of people and there needs and there choices. Management was a great factor which helped me gain my abilities on how to gain world class customer experience. Amazon has a great sense of flexibility towards work culture as it understands the need of the employees and works accordingly. A hardest part of the job was to gain customer's experience. Most enjoyable part of the job was to interact with different kinds of people and there needs and working to fulfill them.
good,no way to advance and lots of wear and tear on your car. Pros are you get to work for yourself in your own vehicle and there is usually unlimited routes offered. There is not overtime.
good,My overall experience has been a great one.  I really enjoy working for Amazon they value there employee's on a day to day basis.  The best teamwork yet.....
good,stand up for yourself if you hear something you shouldn't! Management isn't always right and youll be respected so much more for speaking up and fighting for what you believe in
good,Work environment is good because I like to work independently. The hardest part of the job is keeping my level of productivity up because it depends on the merchandise received. But the area managers and their assistants are very encouraging and acknowledge when goals are achieved.
good,Was and is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time while I was there.  Some jobs require you to stay moving while others don't. But the most important thing is learned was to stay hydrated all the time.
good,"Very fast paced."
good,"worked 7 peaks, over 6 yrs with Amazon in pack dept. Had opportunity for away team in Chicago in 2016. Great pay and benefits however they don't recognize carpal tunnel as a work injury. Had surgery for it after 5-6 yrs and couldn't get the rhythm back.  Loved my job and managers were great. Managers worked with me but still had to make rate and was getting hard at 62+ yrs old. Great for younger people, they do a lot of advancement if you are willing. Hated leaving but left on high note and not because couldn't make rate anymore. Was in the quarterly company magazine with an interview which was nice. Managers change often which is good for them, but sad for us as we get used to someone. Left with buyout bonus of $5000 for 5 peaks as Amazonian. 2 yrs were as ISS."
good,"I enjoyed my working experience there overall.  I wanted to work for Amazon again. It is a great company, good working environment, clear vision, diverse workforce."
good,"Amazon is a fabulous place to work!  It is a nice company filled with wonderful coworkers and bosses!  It provides good pay and it is a great job!"
good,"Should keep the pay "
good,Provided us with an ability to choose our shifts via our mobile phones. However due to the competitiveness of the job it was very difficult to secure a shift throughout the day let alone the week.
good,"A very fast growing company, very good management, excellent job culture."
good,Amazon is really only about numbers. They will show some type of gratitude to the associates by offering free food and raffling prizes.   Great for those trying to stack up their money fast.
good,Like all companies their could be improvements in some areas but all in all this job is a great job for  people who are looking for temp job and full-time. With the bonus of stock and the benefits you will grow and be part of a great growing company.
good,Go to work and do your job it’s a awesome place to work. There are a lots of pros and cons on working there. Everyone’s nice calm and thier for work most of the time .
good,"Management of other have poor attitudes and think their above you. Didn't want to help anyone with anything, the gossip was like high school! Too much childishness & drama."
good,"It's one of the best places I've worked so far."
good,"it about meeting daily task and solving problem. Management is good and well organized. lots of fun recreational facilities, but hard work is all that matters."
good,"Amazon is a wonderful fun energetic and all around great place to work... no dress code at this place means that you can express your personality through your wardrobe and not feel pressured buy suites and formalities."
good,"It's a part time position but if you're looking for a something that is satisfying and fun this is the place to be, The Managers are all willing to work with you and are all very polite."
good,"Fue en Alemania en Bad Hersfeld durante la campaña de navidad, muy buen trato con personal y muy buena organizacion"
good,"I loved my job at Amazon, however thier my leave policy is in need of repaier!!! You are given different advise by different departments and 8f your paper work from your doctor doesn't match other paperwork from lets ssy the Dr receptionist then u loose uour job for coming back to work a day earily!!!! Yep thats right!!!"
good,"Good salary comparing what's around and amount of work done."
good,I Like working at Amazon and the feeling that I had a small part in helping people with their order. It gets busy but that helps the time go by quickly.
good,"While working at Amazon I have learned a lot of things. For example, I learned the importance of working together as a team. The hardest part of my job is making sure I get my number per hour."
good,"My time at Amazon was spent as  Program Manager in Amazon Publishing. The team was great to work with and the role was very dynamic. I learned about an entirely new industry, while still remaining within the technology realm. There's a lot to accomplish in any given day at Amazon, so there is never time to really take a break. I found myself moving from one task to another and planning/strategizing between tasks - even during lunch time."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. The environment is very laid- back. the only thing about Amazon is everything is based upon a rate that you have to succeed everyday. Sometimes it is hard to succeed that rate due to the hot climate in the warehouse. Overall, though Amazon is a great place to work at."
good,"Working there was easy going and there was always plenty of work to do, easy to understand and learn under the eye of management, exciting to learn all the department's and experience everything"
good,Management and human resources is unprofessional other then that i like the people i worked with. Training is pretty good. So are the benifits that they offer.
good,It is like any typical warehouse workplace. You work for 10 hours then you clock out. You get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. You make good pay.
good,I loved working with the company the company made me realize.  I HATED the regular 9-5 job.  Lots of the same call but they become easier with time.  Overall Management is easy to talk to.  The most difficult part of the job is keeping up with all of the policies.  Even if you know a policy look it up to make sure there are no changes that have occurred overnight.
good,"I like the culture at amazon.  I wish there were more hours offered, but unfortunately, part time is all that is offered at this time.  There are nice benefits offered after working there 60 days.  Free vision and Dental"
good,"Amazon was an experience that I will never forget, met some life long friends and would never turn down an opportunity to be a part of that process again."
good,"Would go back."
good,"Not enoughful hours job p/t"
good,"Ottima esperienza, precisione e molta organizzazione"
good,"I had fun working there even though it was seasonal. Everyone was nice there. Though kinda wish the first and second breaks were a little longer, You have older people working there and its taking a toll on there body"
good,very nice and friendly working environment. Everyone with a similar age group and having a helpful nature. learned work management and warehouse functions
good,loved working there was hired on as a temp but I guess I didn't meet the requirements to get hired on full time through the company so I quit. I would def go back if I needed to
good,Lots of work you'll only get bored when there is none. Managers are nice and always willing to help you. You'll learn man different job functions in your department.
good,"If you want a warehouse job it's pretty good but, don't expect this to be useful for your career. They also do not provide college assistance for most programs especially not for business programs."
good,"it is a fast-paced, easy fun place to work. you will learn your dept very thorough. very easy no hard part of job. most enjoyable is helping everyone from every dept"
good,"my typical day at work is hard work and a pleasant place to work ive learn  so many things un  load trucks, scan packages ,ues a hand jack,water spidering and how to work together as  a team.the mangement are sweet i love them all they are pleasant people to work with.the work place have different cultures working there.The hardest part of the job is when your co worker's doesent want to work as a team.The most enjoyable part about the job is when we all come together as a team and get it done."
good,"Respeito ao próximo,qualidade e ética,profissional."
good,"Amazon is one of the best companies to work for and that I have ever worked for. The money is great, they allow you to be yourself and grow. The only downside is the shifts, mostly you are working night shift. And managers don't always care much about you and guide you."
good,"Ambiente di lavoro stimolante."
good,it was good.. until I had to have surgery. and when I tried to get time off I couldn't so I had to use my pto and my non pto..and when I finally ran out of it.. I was let go. so I moved back to texas
good,It was OK. The environment was very relaxed. They just need to pay more and offer full-time not part-time seasonal with hopes of getting to stay full-time.
good,as a worker of amazon one leading role services and product provided to every customer is satisfied and efficient.its fun while working at amazon enjoying team and group working is big ahead to future in amazon.
good,Great job to work out with friendly management great benefits etc. good for fast learners who strive for good quality and love pleasing customers to get them the best quality items delivered to their doorstep.
good,A typical day at work would be using a computerized scanner to pick products from a pallet and store them in their appropriate bins. The products would be packaged and given to the delivery driver. We would also take inventory of the products.
good,I don't really have anything critical to say about working at the Amazon Fulfillment Center. I enjoyed working there and the pay was great! I just couldn't keep up with the 100 items per hour every day.
good,I got an opportunity to work with great leaders and learn a lot while having fun. It was a very good experience. I used was given an opportunity to use my skills in solving the ad-hoc issues.
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. Work was fast based and numbers/goal oriented. Had a lot of people who worked there. Very impersonal. Very hard to communicate with any supervisors. You could only contact HR.
good,The call center had a very positive and fun culture. Met lots of interesting and nice people.  They give you lots of ownership when dealing with customers.
good,Amazon was an ok job for right now but the management was okay they did what they suppose to do what I learned you have to stay busy. amazon was a job that wanted to get better
good,Crazy all nighters. When you go for training be prepared to stay at least 7 hours they really need you to get the idea of the safety criteria other than this once your first day starts you'll be set
good,I feel my time at Amazon was cut short due to a lack of motivation and too much work for 1 person. They try to overwork you always standing . towards the end of shift ablot op people leave when unpaid time off becomes available
good,"I really loved being an employee at Amazon, once I really got the hang of it the work was very easy, I had great coworkers and Managers. The fact that I can take my lunch and break whenever I wanted was great, I love the routes I was given, the customers were nice and I didn't have not one problem with working there"
good,1. I learned team work
good,to put it simple just don't be lazy working for Amazon. The place is wonderful as a whole. My only major issue I have to say just be flexible and willing to work.
good,Overall I have no complaints but a few people who I encountered who should have never made it into management. I would highly recommend their virtual positions.
good,"Good place to work, help you to develop, inside and outside of work"
good,Amazon Customer Service Positions were nice. It seemed like we had great training to do our job. I was always treated well as an employee. They sent me a birthday card!
good,Coming and getting set up for your workstation. Going to different stations where they needed the most help. Learning something new everyday. The company showed the employees that really care about them with the rewards that they offered
good,I enjoyed my job here.Amazon is a great place especially during peak. I would tell anyone looking for a good job they should try going there first before anything else. But thats only if they are willing to walk and stand for so many hours.
good,"une chance pour tous a l entree"
good,Great place to work.  The training aspect of the job was the best!  You follow the modules and learn the job quite easily.  I love the IT aspect of Amazon because they were always readily available to assist you if you have technical issues
good,"Amazon is a great place to work where, both work life and personal life is balanced. With a very open minded environment. "
good,"Managers is perfect persons, we need to work on target, and is not easy but there is lots of friends,. there is two break time of 30 minutes. there iam learn English."
good,"The pay is good,the hours are long but once you get used to it its not bad at all. It gets repetitive, but you can always sign up to learn new functions."
good,"My co-workers at Amazon were amazingly talented and willing to work hard to take care of customers. Most companies talk about how important customers are, at Amazon, people actually do something about it."
good,"My overall experience while working for Amazon consisted of a fun, fast paced professional environment where associates and management were able to reflect a team or extended family atmosphere where everyone pulled together to accomplish every task safely and efficiently. Amazon is a company that hires abled individuals ranging in ages 18+, consisting of a true melting pot of ages, life experiences, nationalities, and abilities."
good,"Working at Amazon usually starts with a stretch warm up where we focus on stretching out our arms, back, shoulders,and legs. Its important that we stretch out our bodies because we're lifting packages the can be 50 pounds or more. One thing that I learned from amazon is that when dealing with lifting heavy packages its important to lift with your legs and not your back."
good,Very laid back fun atmosphere. There is always potential to promote within the company. Friendly people and supportive leaders. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have fun while you work.
good,"Management sucks but that's everywhere. The pay, benefits, hours, paid time off/unpaid/paid vacation time is very generous. You're given stocks on your first day. Its a great place!"
good,"The management was fine. "
good,Was able to access data entry jobs online that I could accept on my time and schedule. Excellent way to have a little extra cash flow. Amazon offered transcribing as well as data entry positions available with right requirements.
good,Making everyday an internal competition amongst employees and recognition for their efforts!  Awesome place to work if you want to be on the cutting edge of today's e-commerce platform.
good,"When employees arrive at work, they gather with management to discuss expectations for the day.  Employees are expected to be consistent with their pick rates, working to match or beat the previous day's rate.  You have to be cautious not to enter restricted areas of the building as this could result in termination of employment."
good,"Was great there for the most part, got a lot of points though once one day for another supervisor taking some people to do another thing that isn’t our job"
good,"Quick paced, friendly people, great managers, great training, no uniform required, encouraged to dress comfortably, help offered if needed, great work schedule selection, great pay during peak"
good,"This is an amazing place to work. I have learned many new skills at my center. I can say that the benefits are the best I have seen. Its the pay scale for the entry level position that is hard to get by on, therefore I am having to continue my search."
good,I loved working here. During peak season it was quite a workout but I enjoyed it. I would have stayed if I didn't have to work midnights there. The worst part was the wait time to be hired. From the time I applied and went to the hiring event it was a 3 month wait.
good,"I enjoy the the physical and constant movement of warehouse work. There is also flexibility in picking shifts. if you are new to working at a warehouse, you are given training, both online and on the job. There are meetings everyday in each shift to emphasize productivity, safety, and changes. Everyone is available to answer questions or if you need help during your shift."
good,"i love working with amazon but i dont see any ping pong table in amazon, i am always busy in part time jobs but i like to play in fun with friend but in jobs area."
good,"Amazing work culture , the management is good. Lots of things to learn at work . Challenging environment . Work life balance is the best at Amazon. Mangers understand the employees situation and act accordingly."
good,Amazon is good place to work. It pays the bills . Its just they expect too much. Work long stressful hours and they still feel you should enough energy to try and stay awake . ESPICALLY  if you are on night shift.
good,I had a great time working for Amazon as a seasonal employee. The managers and supervisors were nice and helpful. The employees were also great and helpful.
good,"Entreprise géniale ! Toute l'équipe est super , nombreux avantages au sein de cette entreprise . Locaux très propres"
good,Very god job many oprortunity good management  I work stower and was fun for me because I am competitive and they give bonus if u are good and I really  wana go back very very good job for me and for all competitive people
good,Required to complete tasks in a certain time frame. People are on a quota system. the workplace areas were climate controlled. Fun atmosphere with co-workers.
good,I enjoy enjoyed working at Amazon everyone was friendly managers are there to help you I lost a lot of weight constant moving but Amazon is a hard job.
good,they worked with my busy schedule and gave me flexible hours to attend school and care for my children. now I am looking for a full time job to provide for my family.
good,This is a fast paced environment provides education to all that wants to advance they are safety oriented and place the employee first.  The benefits are awesome.
good,"It was fun. I worked 10 hrs/day. During the season there was 20 hrs of overtime and that would equal 60 hours being full time. There was one day off during the season but after the season was over, we would have 3 days off. There were always gift cards and prizes to win during the season. Also, the season is a very busy time with lots of work to do. You're always on the move to keep up with rate and quality too."
good,"12 hour days on the reduced time schedule of Thursday through Saturday nights 6:30 p.m.-7 a.m. Two 30 minute breaks at 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m., and one 15 minute break at 5:00 a.m."
good,"Amazing place to work . Its all about work hard, have fun and make history. For amazon its all about customers . Customers are the number one priority."
good,"Since it consists of a four-hour minimum workday, it truly works around your schedule. Whether you're looking for a small extra income, you go to school, or you have other responsibilities, working at Amazon offers a fair salary and a rewarding experience each day."
good,"It takes a special type of person to succeed at Amazon. One that takes pride in what they do. One that's super competitive! Time management is a must in any position! Being not only efficient, but accurate is a true must! The biggest thing that Amazon friends upon is disappointing their customers by saying they have a product, then it not be there, or an order not getting to the customer on time. Those 2 are the biggest no no's! If you can't count, or work in an isolated setting, for hours on end, while striving for perfection in everything you do, you probably do not want to be an Amazonion. Dedication, competitiveness and accuracy... Did I mention being fast and accurate? Yeah, it is not for everyone. 80% of new hires don't make it through the first month. Out of the 20% that do, 80% of them don't make it through the first year! But if you can and if you do... The possibilities are ENDLESS!!! Amazon gives an opportunity to everyone! No college, no problem. Made a criminal mistake in you part and have a record? No Problem! The hardest workers are usually the ones that don't have anything to lose anymore! "
good,"The company pays close attention to safety, inventory quality and meeting daily productivity goals.  They hold associates accountable in all 3 areas within the company during working hours."
good,"I have a very good team in my department, in peek season, we have many activities in the building that help the worker to forget little bit about the time that they spend working. We respect each other"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. It was truly an enlightening and enhancing experience. I met such a diverse group of people, who all wanted to work together to accomplish the same goal. My skills as a team player were definitely enhanced, along with my leadership skills. The managers were unlike most managers I have worked for. They expected you to do your job proficiently but they were also in turn understanding when uncontrollable issues arose."
good,Love this job! Would work there again. Really enjoyed the upbeat atmosphere. Yea sure you gonna have trying days but overall i found the work pleasant. The pay wasn't do good. $10.50 p/h is hardly enough to leave from now a days. Amazon could easily pay more on the hour and it probably would decrease the higj turn over they have. Make no mistake. I worked for my 10.50.
good,Easy to learn jobs with more than fair pay.  Company that cares for it's employees and customers more than any other major retailer.  Positive working environment with plenty of hours.
good,"I worked at Amazon for a year and it was probably one of the best jobs I ever had. Simple but fast-paced work, upbeat environment, music and lots of fun meetings. Amazon also provides plenty of paid time off, un-paid time and vacation time every couple of months so it's very flexible with family/social life."
good,I want to see for first time how it's to work on amazon. And then I want to still know if another people it's happy to wark hard an onastlly... And after i want to see the hardest part of the job on Amazon
good,Amazon is a great company and growing daily. The work is manageable and fast paced. The management team is willing to help each associate and provide growth opportunities.
good,"Crowded with employees I work in a very big and earsplitting warehouse. The breaks are not comforting…the main reason for this is you spend 10 minutes walking to and from the break areas. They want you to punch in and out by your working area then walk to your break area. Your break is then 20 minutes 2 times a day I really felt cheated every day. Managers check in with you maybe once a day to make sure you are keeping up with the rate. They really don't do much and probably don't deserve the pay they receive. Management is 90% fresh out of college with little to no experience, furthermore the pay gap between management and Associate is bewildering. Amazon is a very fast paced environment that allows no room for mistakes what so ever, as much as I love working there my efforts were not appreciated and the expectations they set for new workers is preposterous."
good,"Drink lots of water"
good,fun work place with great benefits excellent pay team player job and every one there treats eachother with respect. overall to say amazon is a good place to work
good,I have nothing but good things to say about Amazon but not enough characters to say it in. I love working for amazon. There's never a doll moment there.
good,Friendly staff and management flexible schedule great pay and benefits lots of advancement opportunity and training and job security is based on your performance
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon fulfillment center it was a fun fast paced enjoyable environment and I recommend anyone looking for employment there to apply.
good,"I enjoy the culture with Amazon. I am just looking to move up and make more money at a faster pace than it is currently happening. Managers are all pretty new, without a lot of experience. Many of them make a lot of mistakes. We all make mistakes, no matter how long you have been in a position. However, I see them making the same mistakes over and over again. I come from the people business so I can't help but to watch people. Current managers don't seem to take the time to learn their employees strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, weak links are often placed into certain areas where I believe they don't belong. While I am  constantly acknowledged for my scan and rate performance, they have no idea that not only do I have more management experience than they do, but also a degree and half way done with my MBA. I cannot comprehend how they can acknowledge my work ethic but not notice that I don't fit in with the rest of the current employees who work under them?"
good,"Es ist ein angenehmes arbeitsklima, dennoch nach einer gewissen Zeit etwas langweilig. War aber Zufrieden mit allem."
good,"During my internship at Amazon, I learned so much from the team, my manger, and on the job. The experience is amazing because Amazon wants you to perform and allows you to experiment a lot. I got the experience to learn a lot about technology and meet/work with some of the smartest individuals from around the world. Amazon is a lot of hard work because they push for number #1 and that means for people that are single that is awesome, but for people with family that can be difficult. I loved that Amazon stays true to its culture and always references the leadership principles, no matter what role or department."
good,"some what fast past, management is out going, easy to approach about anything. work environment is upbeat most days. hardest part of the job is just lifting heavy boxes"
good,"Amazon è un'azienda dinamica, in estrema crescita che fornisce grandi opportunità di sviluppo. L'azienda mette i propri dipendenti nelle condizioni migliori affinchè possano svolgere al meglio il proprio lavoro."
good,"I've known for a lot of people to have complained about working for Amazon because of they work hours and management. I however liked working at Amazon, the hours were acceptable and the work environment was pretty cool, they also had great benefits as well, many that you won't find in other companies today. As long as you are a hard worker you shouldn't have any problems from management. The management at Amazon is different, many of the managers when I was working for the company were young and fresh out of college and those were one's who didn't know how to speak to employee's correctly or even wasn't well with managing period. Management was my only problem when working at Amazon, although I did my job as expected, managers over all need to learn to talk to employee's with respect as they would like they employee's to do unto them. Make sure to where comfortable shoes since you will be on your feet all day, always dress comfortably!"
good,I need work for this job only shift morning 9-13 because in the aftenon i have second job ...   i now very good aria to  eastley and i have experience to delivery
good,"I really didn't realize what a great company Amazon was to work for until I moved on to another company and saw the difference! Amazon knows how to treat their employees well! None the less, the work is very physically demanding and I just couldn't take it anymore. I'm 50 years old, always thought of myself as physically fit, cleaned houses for a living prior to Amazon, but working there made me feel like I was falling apart! Cuts, bruises, sore joints and muscles on a constant basis. The work was boring most of the time, mundane, mindless, and almost unbearable. But some of the managers made it fun, they were amazing at keeping moral up! Others didn't seem to care one little bit or even know what they were doing? Overall, great company to work for, glad I had the experience!"
good,"Amazon is hard work but there benefit are the best!  I enjoy the diversity the most.  Easy to move up, must have the desire for healthy competition. There motto, Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History!"
good,"In my own words Amazon is a great step in the right direction for the right person. It is a challenging work place and hard to balance a hectic schedule. There is a motto; work hard, play hard; well here you will do that and more."
good,Great place to work as long as you want a fast paced place to work. Keeps you on your toes. I enjoy the work I do and management is friendly and will always listen to you concerns.
good,It was a Good job and a good salary but the location was too far away so too much travelling for me but otherwise would recommend as employer and handy for Christmas job
good,A typical day at work is Productive and Full of people i have grown to care about! I have learned Several things and Would love and have opportunity to move up but I would Love even more to Start a career in the Medical field. The hardest part of my job Is the hours And the most enjoyable is the Bond i have crated with my management and several people i consider Close friends now!
good,"He leído algún comentario y don respetables pero no es una mala empresa totalmente al revés apesar de que la situación a día de hoy en Martorelles es muy dura porque muchísima gente a ido fuera pero todo tiene su porque muchos volverán y serán blue si se trabaja muchísimo y es muy duro pero también está muy bien pagado y hacen muchas cosas por el trabajador yo a día de hoy estoy en tensión constante porque no se cuando me tocará mi asta pronto pero espero que sí me voy así sea un hasta pronto porque somos una familia los que estamos ay y nos an echo crecer en muchos aspectos aunque este lunes me toque irme siempre voy a estar muy agradecida por la oportunidad y por todo lo que me llevo aparte de un gran aprendizaje y por último yo entré por manpower y las chicas que hay dentro de manpower pendientes de nosotros son increíbles personas las cuales nos an alludando y apollado muchísimo siempre que nos a echo falta!! La empresa tiene sus cosas buenas y malas pero como cualquier trabajo yo me quedo con lo bueno la gran evolución en todos los aspectos y la piña que Emos echo dentro.. espero no irme pero si así es ojalá vuelva porque es una gran empresa solo me queda decir gracias, g"
good,"If you're a leader that has been in management for a number of years you would love the way this company takes you out of your normal routine and ""THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX""! "
good,"Working at amazon showed me to work in a fast paced environment, and to work under pressure. The hardest part of the job for me was working ten hours a day."
good,"Me gustaba empezar el día con los estiramientos para poder empezar a trabajar, había buen ambiente de trabajo pues prácticamente trabajas sola para poder alcanzar la productividad pues el trabajo exigía calidad, aprendí a trabajar bajo presión y con calidad al mismo tiempo, la parte mas difícil era que caminabas todo el día pero como el trabajo no es pesado el tiempo transcurría rápido y con el paso del tiempo te acostumbras. me gusta el trabajo en equipo."
good,Fast paced place to work with great benefits.a chance to meet many different people and gain experience to be used in jobs continuously. Great safety initiatives and teams.
good,"The job was very repetitive, and monotonous. However, the pay and benefits were both excellent, and there are several different jobs to learn to help relieve boredom."
good,Currently working as a contractor at Amazon.  Really great environment and people.  especially enjoy the very collaborative and innovative environment.
good,I loved this jobs and only have to leave to due health issues. They offer great benefits and time off. Two paid breaks and an unpaid lunch. Everyone is chill.
good,love working for this warehouse super laid back work environment and deceit salary everything offered is a plus to employees love the shifts they offer and the understanding of working with the scheduled
good,Nice place get along with everybody  i’m a people person   So I got to know a lot of people within the time I was their . Everybody is  friendly manager stay on top of everything No favoritism that’s what I love about the managen
good,"Worked there for three years already. Went from one company to the next while I was there. Many changes throughout the years, including management. Overall not something that would be done career wise."
good,"During peak season we had mandatory overtime, meaning we had to pull 10 hour shifts for 6 days a week. This is where i was unable to balance my work/life time. Mainly searching for a job that has less than 60 hours per week."
good,"Great place to work, will take care of you and make sure you know your appreciated. You can always find someone to help you with what you need. Will go above and beyond for you."
good,"Every day when you come in, you have to report to the floor to do exercises so your muscles won't be tight. I learned how to pack a box, the professional way. There we're a lot of managers on the floor, who helped you & encourage you. The hardest part for me was speed."
good,great co workers everyone is friendly great place to work stress free always a fun day at the job leadership is friendly and out going. peek season is the best everyone works together to get the job done.
good,I love working at Amazon! Couldn't ask for a better management team!! I started as a full-time seasonal associate and have great hopes and expectations for advancement!
good,"Always on the go.  As a supervisor, I had the opportunity to work with and train up to 10 associate and help promote them further in the company.  There are plenty of opportunities at amazon for advancement.  The leadership teams are great with the associates and often seek to understand every situation with positive intent first.  Overall Amazon was a phenomenal workplace.  Tons of fun a prizes and great culture."
good,"This is a great job to get you out of the rough spot and get you to where you need to be quickly. Need a hooptie? You can get one with 2 checks from Amazon. Its very hard on the body but you are payed well for your labor. You are constantly on your feet for almost 10 hours straight, so be forewarned. Wasn't so fond of the job but I loved the money! Beats McDonald's for sure!"
good,Awesome understandable mangers. Different work shifts. Reasonable pay. Fast pace. Need to work well with others and need awesome communication skills.
good,Nice place to work with where talents are recognized in a proper metrics also place where fun is also accepted. If compensation is given as expected a nice place to work.
good,"I learned how to run a storefront about 7 years ago working alongside a friend, since than i began my own storefront and have been an active merchant with Amazon.com for 5 years."
good,"Clock in- team stand up talk, stretch, clap out, assign jobs, many different jobs to do throughout work hours. Throughout the day jobs change, all jobs are easy to learn and do at a fast pace."
good,"The best part of working at Amazon.com is the workplace. It is completely free from all the restrictions. It has no dress code though people are dressed informally, they are really well behaved. Lastly, it was a great opportunity to work with a company that stands by the richest man in the world."
good,"A typical day at amazon consists of a lot of standing. 10hr shifts, 4 days a week until peak season your shifts will change to 11 hours, 5 days a week. You get one 30 minute break & two 15 minute breaks so it's pretty tiring. However HR and management are pretty good with the workers. They take your opinions into consideration and really act on them. Amazon is filled with all different types of people, its a huge facility. The hardest part of the job would be the long hours of standing and the fact that you barely see your home. By time you get home you're going to bead and once you get up its time to go back to work. You basically live there. The most enjoyable part is probably the people and the pay."
good,The hardest thing I felt at amazon was trying to put up 1 item every 10 sec.. I try so hard to do what they ask that was they only problem I had everything else was great. Paid PTO and vacation health ins.
good,"work hard..have fun..make history.."
good,"I have worked for Amazon twice, once seasonal and once as a reservist. I was allowed to choose my own hours and work when I wanted. The call volume is great and the environment is relaxed."
good,"its fun working there, great management and great team experience. career advancement is encouraged and it's a multi-cultural environment where they listen to your ideas."
good,"For the work that we do a better pay scale would be awesome.  The time that we work in is not set with the spay scale, making it hard for single parents to survive."
good,Very fast paced and on your feet 10 to 12 hours a day or more. Very physical job must be physically fit and ready to work from the time you get there to the time you leave. Great benefits and great pay though if you can deal with the fast paced work.
good,"I loved working for Amazon but during thre training whenever I asked a question so that I could try To understand what they were teaching I was Told things like "" we don't have time for that now""  and was never really allowed to get a full understanding of the material and never felt comfortable asking question and have a full perticipitory experience and as a result never felt confident regarding my ability to perform well on the job and eventually sought employment elsewhere"
good,"Amazon is a very fast paced job yet very productive, i'd say you have to be in pretty great shape to maintain the long hours (weighs in on your body) the benefits are indeen great, job requires a lot of energy depending on your department overall an ok experience to me."
good,"Long days, but you are rewarded."
good,"Great place to work, full of hard working and talented people. There are lots of opportunities to extend your training and take on new challenges. Plenty of manager and peer feedback."
good,Great work place. It always work to keep you moving and never bored. Life at amazon was like your own world. Great things come from great work amazon is a great place.
good,"A typical day at work would be slow during the first half of the day and fast paced at the last half. I'd learn that there's always room for improvement and growth within' the company and outside. The management team is diverse and unique to each of their own shifts and always evolving to create a better and safer environment while increasing productivity. The hardest part of the job haves to be during crunch time when our shipments have to be out by an certain time, a lot can go wrong at the last moment if were not on top of everything. The most enjoying part of the job must be clearing everything on time at the end of the shift, especially on a heavy day."
good,"The work environment was fast with little time to relax or switch to another task. I was on my feet 99% of the time. However, the pace made the time go by faster and there was always something new to learn each passing day."
good,"Friendly, positive atmosphere.  Excellent training. Safe environment.  Great breakroom.  Super vending machines. Opportunity to grow and advance.  Generous pay range. Lots of overtime."
good,"Great place to work. I am not currently looking to leave as I love working at amazon.com, but it never hurts to have your options open as you never know what opportunities will present themselves."
good,Good place to work but less opportunities for progression have to be well focused at work at all times not a good management to support you to reach at your daily targets.
good,"Days go by fast as long as you stay busy and focused.  You will learn any different trades like scanning, driving forklifts, and stacking and closing pallets."
good,"A typical Day we will clock in go to stand up and talk about our goals for the day. What we need to improve on from the past and where we need to be as far as our productivity and customer satisfaction. After stretching we will go to our stations and start picking or stowing in what ever department you work in. We have two breaks and a 30 minute lunch , the lunch room has all kinds of games and TV plenty of food and drinks. After the last break you finish up your last two hours of work then clean up your station and clock out."
good,"Typical day at work for me consisted of stowing items on shelves or checking items in through the receiving department and sending them on to the stow department. I learned a lot about their warehouse practices. Most of my coworkers were great, and the atmosphere was fun and upbeat. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the extreme heat in the summer months but you usually stay so busy that time flies by very quickly."
good,Amazon is a good place to work for a person that does not mind the day to day factory work.  If you are satisfied with doing the same thing everyday.  There are rates that have to be met and there are plenty of opportunities to change you position.
good,"A typical day at Amazon was nice, relaxed, and fast-paced. When you start working there you spend your first week learning the job. As well as how to operate a sherry picker. Management is pretty easy to work with."
good,"Ich bin lernfähig, fleißig, flexibel und teamorientiert. Ich arbeite gerne mit unterschiedlichen Menschen zusammen. Arbeiten unter Zeitdruck ist für mich selbstverständlich."
good,A very fast paced environment that keeps you busy. But I do enjoy the work there .  It's a place that makes you feel energetic and needed. You are rewarded when you work well in the set environment
good,"Learned how to build boxes, ship and pack packages. The pay rate is great and you do get paid time off. But they do work you as a slave depending on the situation."
good,"Plenty of shifts to chose from, long hours great pay and benefits, different departments and roles very competitive place hard work does pay off plenty of incentives. Being a team player / motivator pairs well for any role."
good,"Come tipo di lavoro sicuramente dinamico,ma gratificante direi,con la possibilità di conoscere e svolgere mansioni di ogni genere."
good,"Excelente empresa onde tive a oportunidade de trabalhar em um cargo que nunca tive antes, ao qual foi muito benéfico e prazeroso"
good,"Working for Amazon atl 6 fulfillment center was a breeze, coming to the orientation and drug screenings was some of the most active first days ever staring day I was able to enjoy everything their is to do in side of the warehouse"
good,"Working at amazon was fun, but hours were not always over 20 a week. Management started to become a little over the top. Work itself was super easy. Could take time off pretty much whenever for personal time. Great for college students not living on their own or for people who pretty much have no bills. You cannot make it here financially if you need the cash."
good,"Good company, excellent benefits but monotonous, no growth and extremely poor management of some departments. Benefits like work from home, food coupons, cab facility are really good."
good,"Typical day is energetic, random area assignments to permit cross-training to determine the best fit for you at the facility."
good,I feel that amazon could be a lot better if their company wasn't all about numbers. So many employees are in fear of losing their job because of them not making the rate they should be in x amount of time.
good,very flexible nice hours overall good company to work for I would recommend the work from home position to mothers that enjoy being at home with their children and still want to work to bring in income.
good,"I have worked for Amazon for a little over 2 months and I have receive a raise of 1.00 per hour. I enjoy the atmosphere and co-worker interactions."
good,"Highly recommended for second job if needed, good for EXTRA income. Easy work company cares about employees, management can be difficult sometimes but it's not that bad."
good,"A typical shift in the Prime Now warehouses is busy!  Most shifts go by fairly quickly, and the managers are helpful and approachable.  There's not much time to get to know co-workers, but people are generally friendly and we have a good time."
good,"Great place to work, compensation is lacking compared to other companies. "
good,"Provides with the best culture for work."
good,"This company is so far the best I've worked at. The work was easy and enjoyable, the team was amazingly friendly and helpful. All around lovely job. Would highly recommend."
good,"Friendly and helpful coworkers and managers, easily affordable food, understanding managers, mix culture of employees, good pay designated smoking locations and multiple cafeterias to help ensure you can get to one quickly enough to enjoy lunch at your liesure"
good,It was my pleasure working with amazon because I got to learn many things from them especially how to tackle with different kinds of customers and the best part is that as a fresher I got that exposure which always helped me to move a head in my career.
good,"I loved working here during the Peak Season, I plan to do this every Year around the same time. The pay is good, the work is steady. The Culture  is amazing."
good,"Part-time work with flexible hours, Great management, Hours are good, Work load is easy, Fun environment, always improving processes to work load. LOVE IT!"
good,Its a really nice place to work with they work with any schedule that you want. Their paid its really good also their medical benefits are great. Managers thank you hard work.
good,I  uploaded my book and had a great response  this is perfectly amazing company i love being here its all fun go fing lobpve i n my 1st book love in 3 heart attacks
good,"I worked the night shift here, learned to work very hard. The management was good. The workplace culture prompted us to work hard though there were a lot of lazy people. But I liked to beat records at Amazon."
good,Amazon is a fun place to work where we get to pick out what our customers ordered and prepared them for delivery. I love the management team because they care about our opinion and have a voice in what we do everyday.
good,excellent place to work.Fast paced on good days steady paced on bad days. Always something to do to pass the time. if you like physical work then outbound waterspider is what you should apply for... I LOVE IT!
good,"the management at amazon logistics at the hathorne dla8 office sucked and was very sexist. men got ahead of the women and it was known and nothing was done about it. ROLAND IS THE MOST SEXIST. ALSO, the main guy who is in charge of the warehouse, nice indian guy but sexist and only promotes men."
good,"During my 5 years at Amazon I enjoyed 95% of my time there. Most managers were great until they started hiring people that were fresh out of University that refused to listen to experienced associates because ""they knew better""."
good,Good for people who like to work the same hours every day. You get five days straight and two days off. You can sign up for extra days aswell as days off. Management is super friendly and easy to work with.
good,"One of my favorite jobs! Amazon is hard work but the payoff when you get the hang of managing the physical aspect of the job. "
good,"Its a very comfortable company to work at, though we go through work pressure with the customers sometimes but we have fun as we are allowed to listen to music which is a stress buster. As I work for amazon.com dealing with USA and CA customers we improve our command over the language and every day learn something new while we have an interaction with the customers. Its a total package of learning, fun and pressure all together which helps up grow our skills."
good,"Great pay,& benefits! Had to have a stow rate of 300, excellent productivity, tolerate heat,& good attendance. Sent off customers orders, picked, counted, wrapped, etc."
good,"good place to work everybody was really friendly would like to work in amazon but one in Dundee, was really easy to pick up the things I had to do like picker and packer"
good,TOT/Rate is ridiculous. It's a great place for students . They paid $6000 for my school and accommodated my schedule. If you can stand on your feet for 10 hours then go for it
good,"You get paid for the Overtime you do. That's the best thing about the company. Plus point, they believe in balance between work and enjoyment. Hence, no tension for being in tension."
good,"Enjoy working in the Prime Now location. Great team environment and working environment. Management does a good job of keeping things fun, and recognizing associates for their accomplishments."
good,It was great wroking there the pay was decent very nice clean and stable environment people were very friendly I never had any issues at all my whole time there
good,"Very demanding work place, but overall fun environment to work at Amazon web services. I learned a lot working here about the servers, and data centers environment."
good,It was really good. I only had to work 4 hours a week to replace my 16-24hr a week job income. Basically I sold books and school codes I bought from my school bookstore and sold them back online for a profit.
good,"Working at Amazon is a breeze. You pick your own schedule and the work is very easy. The hardest part of the job is memorizing all the different work stations, but once you get that down its fine. However The managers are a bit rude and over bearing at times"
good,I really like this job because it was a position where I could work independently and get paid a decent amount of money to do so in my choice of comfortable attire. It also had great benefits.
good,A lot of opportunity to grow there. You just need time to do it. My advice to go up is to make friends with higher managers. Your hard work will be recognized at that point. Once you make it to a certain spot the pay will indefinitely match the work you put in I guarantee that.
good,"We use to solve the typical update issue when a new feature has launched"
good,"Enjoyed working for Amazon. Great benefits and a very productive place to work. There is always room for advancement. The CEO is a fair person. You have to do your job and stay out of the drama there because it""s easy to get caught up. I made my job work for me by doing just that, staying out of the drama. However, I am a very easy going person and got along with everyone. I did my job and did it well."
good,"A lot of hard work, Great training program, Management was very helpful, especially when staff was short handed. Offer great schedules and flexible times."
good,"1. Good Management"
good,"Amazing workplace with great leaders."
good,Amazon is a nice company to work for. They care about their employees and make you feel part of the team.  The work from home part I was in is very user friendly and there is plenty of help when needed.  If an answer is unknown the work hard to find the answer.
good,It was  as all the  best  of  good  quality  and  valuable  information  acquired. The number of  hours  very  much  okay  .always  night  shift   with  10 to 11 hours of  work every  night.
good,Working at Amazon is great. It's fast paced and fun with positive and helpful people. Time just flies by and the work itself is very doable for everyone. I had to leave too soon
good,"The company is amazing and so is the people , the only downfall is that i had a terrible manager who extended the entire teams contract twice, instead of making us permanent. The worst part is that when some members in the team moved to other teams and fall under other managers within two weeks they become permanent even though their stats was below yours. "
good,"Typical day for working at amazon never changed. Constantly doing the same job thag becomes routine and second nature. My job was to accept returned merchandise from customers and evaluate their feedback of the products. Determining the condition of the item, i would either process those items back into the warehouse or send the item(s) to be refurbished."
good,"10 hour shifts with two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break. It was fast paced and fun. You get to meet a lot of new, interesting people that can become great friends. The hardest part of the job was that certain tasks were repetitive."
good,"I worked night shift at Amazon from 7pm to 5:30am. In their inbound department, it was nice & fun environment to work in. The people that I worked with were very hard working so it made the night flew by & my bosses were nice and they would try to do anything to make our work experience better for us to get more product out of our building quicker."
good,"Though this is a good place to work, a lot of your growth opportunities depend on your reporting manager. Internal politics needs to stop for deserving candidates to grow."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. Only problem is it is too far away and extremely hard to get to on time due to lack of transportation. Enjoyed the job tho
good,"there is a lot of walking , gotta work fast, and there's a lot of people you'll be working with. everyday seems like a new opportunity to learn something new"
good,Amazon was my favorite company I've ever worked for. Easy to learn website so helping customers was a breeze. Relatively easy to work your way up if you're good at your job
good,"Amazon is a hard fast passed environment treats everyone equally  working as fast and professionally manner, managers say they are helpful when needed."
good,Nice morning things starting off  to a good start and time goes so fast its time for lunch and I'm sure hungry you are learning new things there every day management young person has a big head thinks he knows it all but has lots to learn and needs to learn more ways of correct training instead of running around hiding behind someone else he needs to learn how to train a person and help the person before an actual problem occurs.
good,"I clock into work get on a laptop and start reviewing the numbers for the day to check where to place pickers to pick the product for the customers priorities of the day."
good,"I am glad to work with MNC company which is not produce only worker its produce leaders .company provide world class facility to employee like hoh facility for travailing.only provide mineral water for drinking to employee.company work on its policy and compromise on it, all policy are applicable for all level employees."
good,"Love being and OMR at Amazon!!!  Good work environment, competitive pay and benefits.  Learned Work Comp skills, OSHA, OCC Health, Safety and great patient care skills."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Amazon, as an order picker was: driving on the pit machine to pick orders, scan them, and drop them off to the packers."
good,"It was a good job with good benefits. The managers were helpful and there was room for growth. They did not have a good sick policy, and I had a serious medical problem. They were not very understanding. They took all my personal hours off, and that was frustrating. Overall I would say it was a good experience, but I was moving to Corpus Christi and had to leave Amazon"
good,Management was very helpful as well as informative. I felt welcomed from the very first day I started working. Everyone at the warehouse was friendly as well as careful.
good,"Always growing and learning new things, wide client base and never an issue with deposits etc. Flexible schedules and always room to expand you company."
good,I do enjoy it but there is a lot of chances throughout depending on the person. Yiou have rates to meet but it is possible. It is more standing alot and a little labor.
good,Working in a fulfillment is challenging yet rewarding. I recommend taking the job if you are tier 3 or above. Anything less is slave work. Not worth the trouble for the money. Lots of overtime if wanted.
good,"There are so many benefits to working here.  No place is perfect, but it's a great place to build work ethic.  Management treats us good.  The environment was really good to work in.  The most enjoyable part is the people you work with.  Forming bonds and doing good for people.  Hardest part of the job is the craziness of peak and doing repetitive tasks for over a year.  Learned to always keep yourself busy doing something.  Listen to the women.  Listen to the people on the ground, they know whats going on."
good,"I loved working from home. I had a great system of managers and coworkers that made my job here fun and enjoyable. "
good,Working is great. They have games and a foosball table in the break room. The managers generally care about your safety and comfort. They may ask questions to better the work environment. They may take care of lunch on occasion. This is a good place to work.
good,"Amazon has some great leadership principles on which they actually look for while hiring people .The best thing about amazon os they welcome innovations and ideas and they deep dive in the small idea given by any level of an agent and try to implement it.It never alows ones moral to let down."
good,I liked working there for the opportunities that I was given to grow with the Company. I Would work there again! Laid  back atmosphere and so was the staff.
good,Fun at work place. Management team are friendly. Good benefits. Work environment is really great. Long shift. Salary is a bit less when compared to the competitors.
good,"4 hour shifts."
good,"Fast pace and high intensity work place"
good,"Very good experience with amazon, since my first day until the last."
good,"It's customer service...so sometimes that can be difficult because of the type of job it is. People call in about their problems - patience and empathy is important."
good,"They was on point with everything just had to stand on your feet remaining of the ​time for 8-10hrs a day face pace environment"
good,"My years spent working in this org was the most challenging and rewarding time of my life. Great people, management pushes hard but with respect and they too are there in the mud working along side you."
good,"Yea its warehouse work but not like other warehouse jobs, Amazon strives to make working for them fun. plus once your full-time the benefits and pay is amazing."
good,"I love working as an independant contractor for Amazon, I just wish that I had more hours, longer routes and more assignments."
good,Amazon Student BA program is excellent. They treat their employees with a great amount of respect.  I have learned so much in the time that I have been working for Amazon.
good,"Amazon was a really fun workplace. You could learn a lot of new skills, and spent your time at work with people full of culture and positive attitude. Working there was really easy and pleasant. The shift was flying by under the watchful eye of great management, always willing to help you out with any problem."
good,I did job in the company as a field boy from 2014 till first month of 2017 . Between this time when I was working there I never feel bad and insecure for my job .
good,Its a great experience to have worked with one of the renowned organisations such as Amazon. Its been a wonderful journey with Amazon. The career growth is very quick and new learning opportunities coming our way. A lot of support from the management.All in all a great place to work
good,its a great place to be employed... BUT there are a few people here(one supervisor) that has lied and manipulated the system to get me caught up in something where I did nothing. But upper management is terrific they help me solve all of my work related problems in a timely manner and treats me with pure respect. so overall this is a great company glad to be employed here
good,I love working for Amazon.com. Best part of this job. we get to pick our own schedules and some of us are lucky enough to be able to work from the comfort of our own homes.
good,Can be hectic at times due to some departments being open 24/7. Some departments require 12 hour shifts due to certain production fulfillment requirements
good,The staff and team were very helpful in locating positions for me. They responded to situations in a timely manner when I had an issue or question. Would recommend again.
good,I love the company but management need to get better. Have a good opportunity to grown up . Need to focused to work like a team. Good experience and I'm thankful for the time and the opportunity that they give me.
good,"Great company to work with and to earn with along with fun."
good,Trés bonne expérience chez amazon. Je ne regrette pas
good,"A typical day at work would be walking from floor to floor, area to area finding items that need to be shipped. Fast pace is necessary. I learned what's the difference between Off the wall Vans, campared to a nice pair of walking Nike's. I felt management was set up by picking the hardest of the workers, which was not bad. Finding the smallest of items amongst a hundred other small items. The groups meetings were very enjoyable, as were the pre-work workouts. Which made the 10 hour shifts bearable."
good,Amazon is a fun and busy environment. There is always work coming in so your constantly doing something. Walking around the warehouse all day long makes time pass by really fast and even has the added benefit of providing a decent workout.
good,I have been working with Amazon for 5+ years and this is the best company to work for. There are numerous positions that are available and there's always the ability to grow and develop.
good,Amazon is an awesome place to work. Great People and Great management. Opportunity to move up in position and title is available to those who work for it.
good,I loved working at Amazon. I hit my numbers everyday one of the best pickers in bwi2 building. Only thing I hated was how I got assaulted on the job and then fired for doing nothing but reporting it to hr.
good,Work life balance is good and ethically developmed in nature. Properly motivation provided to the employees. Strive to improvise with leadership goals. Good to have worked with Amazon.
good,I loved working in Den5 it was very fun and everybody was respectful. Also all managers were very helpful and I also loved doing the early exercises
good,"- Trailblazer and trend setter. Have good future "
good,"It was a good job. Really good benefits. The hardest part of the job was working the night shift. It was a bit hard getting used to that schedule. It was my first warehouse job, I did learn a lot."
good,i liked the job because the people were nice and when i went through training they showed me how to do my job and stuck with me for two days and made sure i knew what i was doing
good,"I worked in amazon I love it except the hours are break times are not good "
good,"Above minimum wage"
good,with this job you will get a lot of hours and have fun working with like minded individuals. the culture of the building is great with UNMATCHED benefits compared to most places.
good,"I enjoyed the challenges of the fast pace moving up steps and multi tasking .I walked about 15 miles per day on the job, and felt very fit. The supervisors were always very helpful . I did learn to reach for higher goals and scores."
good,"I was hired to work what's called ""Peak Season"" at Amazon, meaning the Holiday season. It was a fascinating place to work at and see how a retailer I've done business with operated. My shift was 4 hours, 5 days a week and I found they had a process for everything and was trained to scan incoming packages of all shapes and sizes so they'd move onto their next destination(s). Each day, a specific goal was set for packages to be processed. It was fast paced, obviously, but I rarely felt overwhelmed and at the end of a shift felt a sense of accomplishment, especially if we'd met our goal for the day earlier than expected. Management was easy-going and treated me well, they'd always update us on how many packages we'd processed. My only regret was not being kept on after Christmas, I would've been curious to see how things go after the Holiday rush"
good,"good jobs just would like flexible hours, very customer service eccentric, workplace culture is diverse. Customer friendly and make sure customers get treated equally"
good,"Amazing place to work in my opinion. Due to the volatile nature of the Industry, one slip can cost your career. I am very blessed to have had the experience, and I do see myself pursuing further opportunities with Amazon later in life. First, I must broaden and expand my experience"
good,Get to work alone most of the time. Management is never over your shoulder to supervise. The culture is great. The hardest part is constantly being on your feet.
good,"un esperienza da fare, la mattina si fa il meeting, poi subito a stoccare gli articoli"
good,"Amazon is by far one of the best warehouse environments you could ask for. A typical day involves a lot of manual labor, packing, lifting, tote-wrangling, etc. I've learned a lot about hard work and procedures from this job. The culture itself is good, it's a friendly, non-threatening environment, while being fast-paced at the same time. The hardest part of the job is the manual labor, but with the constant movement, you'll barely even notice it. The most enjoyable part of the job is, well, everything. It's an enjoyable job, especially if you love hard work and being on your feet. There's a sense of accomplishment that comes at the end of every shift."
good,"A typical day at work was a fun-filled one with coffee and foosball after work. I learned teamwork and coordination with changing members at regular intervals. The hardest part of the job was, by far, after lunch. The most enjoyable part of my job was the work culture."
good,"Very energetic place to work."
good,i work last year to Amazon warehouse în Hemel Hempstead.....i want work again more than 3 mounth i want work permanent contract direct with Amazon Company
good,Great company with good benefits. The atmosphere is full of life and management appreciates the employees. Moral is kept high with contests and fun challenges to complete our tasks. The most difficult part of the day is associates who do not want to work. The most enjoyable part is knowing we are helping make a customer very happy in receiving their Amazon product.
good,"Mi valoración es bastante buena, muy buen ambiente, respeto y educación tanto encargados como operarios, bien remunerado y tuve la suerte de tener un buen horario, es un trabajo que se anda mucho pero se hace ameno."
good,"I enjoy my time working here, the management and supervisors take care of their employees and their customers. The medical benefits are outstanding along with vacation and other benefits."
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon and would have liked a full time job but the traveling become a problem and getting to work was a problem  but would recommend it to anyone
good,"Communative environment, fast paced, goal oriented. The crews and staff are extremely courteous and helpful. All crews and staff function almost as a single cohesive unit."
good,Awesome benefits and salary for the work that is required of you. Stock options and 401k. As well as paid time off and vacation time.
good,"Very fast paced environment but all of the leaders are very helpful and understanding. Rates are to be met but if you're not meeting them, they will try to help you improve. The health benefits are among the best that I've seen"
good,"Great place to work, high turnover rate on associates, always hiring new workers. Always onsite First Responders (2 at all times)"
good,"Good place for start. Before starting they make you induction and training as well ! The team is from different nationalities,and for me is a good point to learn something new and improve your experience !"
good,Lots of nice and willing to help employees. Management is cool and understanding. Break is around 12 minutes long and everyone has a fair chance to try out different areas in the building.
good,"Managing a team of professional drivers, and problem solving as a team. Working together and creating a fun, safe, and friendly work environment. Every package counts!"
good,"Mon travail pour Amazon consiste à porter assistance aux vendeurs utilisant notre plateforme pour faire du commerce. Que ce soit pour une modification de titres ou la fusion de 2 offres identiques en passant par la fermeture de compte et le remboursement client, le job est très varié et aucun cas n'est identique ce qui apporte un certain suspense à chaque fois qu'un nouveau cas arrive dans notre ""Lobby""."
good,"As a packer you receive items and package them. I have learned a lot about ware house work such as pit equipment, machines, and being a trainer. The hardest part of my job is making sure that all of our product gets out on the scheduled time. Amazon treats their employees very well and I love working for them."
good,"I can only speak for the peak season of Oct - Dec.  But it is very busy and challenging. You are on your feet somewhere in the facility for 10 hours.  2, 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute break for lunch.  Some positions you could walk up to 18 miles in a day with climbing stairs as a part of that function."
good,Working at Amazon a fun experience. Working at a fast pace kept the job fun and interesting. Never a dull moment and provided me a chance to meet new people
good,A typical day at Amazon Fulfillment Center included retrieving over 800 items during my shift. The hardest part of the job was walking over 10 miles during my shift. The job was enjoyable because of the comradery between the workers. I loved how every morning the management team cheerfully reviewed our picking goals for the day.
good,"plenty experience gained in this work place, great management, everyone makes you feel welcome and is willing to help and train if you need it"
good,"I would rather not working in a warehouse setting everyday because of the wear and tear it out on my body,but it was fun while the season lasted I enjoys the first year and the second if I had the chance I would go back ever season"
good,What you put in is what you get. Management is great.  Vibrant working environment always room for growth. All in all a very nice place to work especially foe young people.
good,The hardest part of the job was the challenge of de-escalating customers who are irate when they call in. Leadership is amazing.
good,"I really enjoy to work for Amazon Ltd LB1.  I got experience inbound (Receive) and into ICQA department.  I worked in safety in up to date warehouse.  I have had a good communication into team and I got positive feedback,  100% quality and productivity."
good,"""Work hard, have fun, make history"" is the motto of Amazon. And it's truly a great company to work with. Management is so friendly and approachable. Young and enthusiastic employees are really good to to work with. "
good,Things are always moving at Amazon! I have a very supportive team and I just love working with all the customers. You learn something new every day here.
good,"A typical day consists of supplying stowers with work that comes off of mostly 53 foot trailers. Usually the unit count would be well in excess of 8,000 units. Also the relocation of various product and other things between buildings. I have learned a tremendous amount from this job, including the ability to manage a specific work area."
good,"Communication is great, Fun and exciting! Amazon provides great benefits and training for their employees! There is always something GOOD going on at AMAZON!"
good,"Amazon is a excellent company to work for, I enjoy delivering food to clients on time. I dislike that we dont get 8hrs a day."
good,"A typical day (or night) at work was full of nose to the grindstone work. I learned how to properly package a persons order following a quick pace. Management was good, and answered any processing questions that I had. co-workers were what made it all happen. Without one person in the mix of people, the job became harder to do as we would have to pick up the slack from the missing person or do our job and their job as well. The best part of working at Amazon was the flexible schedules that they offered."
good,I loved working at Amazon the only problem is they don't have structure there management is not put together well and they don't keep to their word when trying to help employees
good,it was my first warehouse job met some nice people . one of my managers was very nice .. the pay was not bad found out i was one of the fastest scanners.. and i liked the job.
good,So far so good I enjoy my position  at Amazon  it's very busy and productive the staff is extremely nice an everyone is a team player
good,it was a very good job with great benefits. i helped customers find the items that they wanted all through a scanning system and ensured they received the best of the best
good,Great place to learn and apply your knowledge in operations. Things are hectic and busy so be prepared to work hard. Managers work in shifts and many work in night shifts for at least 6 months.
good,"i do like working here , its fast pace so time fly's, co-workers and management are helpful and understanding. they make sure you get your break, and if we meet our quota management buys pizza for all every Tuesday and Thursday.but there are days that we barely get our 4 hours of work and are sent home after 3 hours ."
good,"Loved working here always OT being offered. "
good,"The company never stop processing customers orders satisfactions."
good,its a fast paced work environment. my coworkers were  always willing to help and stop and ask questions if they were able. management are friendly and approachable. if there was a question that needed answering they were able to get you a response quickly. the hardest part of the job is trying to maintain a rate when there was not any work available.
good,"bonne ambiance entre collègue et dirigeant"
good,Travail sans trop de contraintes dans une entreprise de e-comerce en plein essort
good,My co-workers are great i met a lot of great people and i thank amazon for giving me that chance to meet these wonderful people. They PA's and managers are also great and they were very helpful and care a lot about their employees and their were being.
good,i didn't work this job very much due to the fact that at that particular point in time i did not have stable transportation. But that problem is now fixed.
good,"their modo ""work hard have fun"" stocked break room with plasticware , microwaves, refrigerators, T.V. Xbox, corn hole, basketball hoop this break room even has gatorade and a fountain machine (free) great environment. Safety is their number one priority."
good,"Standing in place all day doing the same thing for ten hours might not be for everyone. But it worked for me and for many people. If you do your job right and ask about other positions it is easy to get into another position. Great benefits, nice management. Does get a bit hectic outside of the picking stations but overall it is pretty good."
good,"I absolutely loved working here, probably my favorite job by far. My day consisted of taking inbound calls from customers to help with account information and shipping issues-all from home! My supervisors were the best and very helpful. Even from across the country they were just a click away! The hardest part of the job was my schedule and adjusting to Pacific time restrictions in East Coast time. The best part was the group chat where your team can chat during your shift so any help you need or words of encouragement are right there!"
good,a fun place to work. i learned a lot from the rf scanners. the management was decent. co-workers were great and er friendly. the hardest part was the constant standing.
good,"I work a typical full time sift, which I was able to select my work hours. I learned how to be more empathetic. I worked a seasonal position and my management changed 4 times while I was there and everyone kind of had different policies on handling situations, so it became a little confusing. My co-workers were awesome, they were always ready and willing to give a helping hand. The hardest part of my job was probably working on not being so blunt/direct with customers when it came to different issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was solving customers problems and sending them in a better mood in which they arrived."
good,"Fun at work"
good,"Imaging Team !! , A team which is loaded with designers and creative Minds. the team is extremely talented and are very helpful for the beginers. A perfect place to work and to get trained to achieve your goals in a specific limited time."
good,Not enough hours are available.  Have to stay attached to your phone if you want to maybe get hours. Ok if you only need 4hrs a week to survive.
good,"After having worked in the insurance industry, the culture and the pace of Amazon was fantastic - smart people that I clicked with and engaging work. I strongly recommend Amazon if you haven't had a chance to work in a large, yet agile firm."
good,"I've learned to adapt to any environment I'm in, to do the task set at hand. I've also learned to take responsibility of my actions, to lead by example, to work hard and to present myself in a professional manner at all times. I help my co-workers when I see they need help. I don't believe there is ever a hard part about a job because I've been trained to succeed; not fail. I enjoy any job I'm working for because its not about liking the job, its about getting it done."
good,"Good opportunities for overtime, with overtime pay. A place for hard workers, and opportunities for advancement. supervisors help you to develop. Managers take ownership of work related problems."
good,A typical day at work was working hard under pressure without making no errors. But with a little help everything was made easier. i mainly enjoyed working with others who had different backgrounds since you can learn alot in one day.
good,"Depending on what indirect role I was assigned to on which day of the week I was the Process Assistant. Typically a PA will assign entry level associates to their station ID's and I would also gather up a team of Problem solvers.  "
good,Great way to start a career but very limited for movement in upper management. They play favorites within an organization and only allow those that they like to move on forward. No time off during peak season which could limit tome spent with your loved ones.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time working at amazon.A typical work day was filled with something new.Most days my co-workers made sure that everybody was on the same page,and where working together.Management worked well us,and made sure we each had the skill-set for our assigned job."
good,Amazon is a great company to learn and grow.  It has been one of the best experiences of my life.  If you are willing to work long hours and display effort Amazon is a great place for you.
good,Every thing is great about this company.... everything leads to a simple system of work and culture..
good,"Not too bad of a job, you're in a werehouse so its hot and smelly and there are quotas you have to meet. on youre feet constantl and is always moving. surrounded by multitude of people"
good,"great culture, fast paced environment, sometime shift is cut by half an hour to an hour depending on packages, and scan rates. Its a good place to work and get a good sweat going if you plan on loosing weight."
good,"Workplace was productive and fun. Good cultural influence among staff, very hard working. Management was excellent."
good,An innovative company that is focused on the future of automation and shipping to enhance customer satisfaction. Amazon is constantly striving to satisfy the customer in quality and timely delivery
good,"Your concerns and issues at Amazon are recognized and addressed at ATL 6 by management.  You are pushed to excel and apply for positions and provided training to receive another skill with Amazon.  During my time with Amazon, I have been truly blessed to be associated with all ethnic groups and management.  Team members assist with questions and listen to your concerns at ATL 6.   We help each other to complete tasks and provide the service to ship and deliver packages in a timely and safe manner.  All team members from all  Lanes are involved in completing and assisting others."
good,"It's a fast pace work, great environment. The co-workers are friendly and they are team workers, the hardest part of the job is to not have enough staff on a busy day. The most enjoyable part is that everybody is on point."
good,"Working in Amazon is a real challenge, the environment is very good, mates are very friendly, but you need to be standing through 8 to 12 hours is a row and it's no too easy sometimes."
good,over all a good company to work for but they need to work on their communication skills with their employees. Great hours if you enjoy working 12 hr shifts. good free coffee at all times. Miss my supervisor he was awesome.

Being at Amazon I have learned how to do so many different jobs and I love it. The management at Amazon I can honestly say we have a good team of management.

good,"Loved working for Amazon!  It's unfortunate that they only pay $10 an hour for work from home Customer Service Reps.  It's a pretty grueling job with all the calls coming in and dealing with some of the customers.  But, they make up for it with contests they have for seasonal workers.  They truly make you feel as you are one of their employees, not just a seasonal worker.  They also empower you to do what you feel is right to make a customer happy."

good,I showed up at 5pm and left at 12am. I would do stretches and then go to the area I was needed. I learned how it was to be in a factory setting. I loved my co-workers.

good,I enjoyed my time with Amazon. It is a great place to work. The co-workers and management are very involved and helpful. The hardest part of the job is sitting for long periods of time. Almost all the customers are friendly and very appreciative.
good,a typical day at Amazon was 12hour shift learned how hitting personal rate effect the whole department management was friendly supportive on getting the job done. the hardest part was the walking distance to break and break room. the enjoyable part was the encouragement of the management to stay on task and hit our rates and always tell us good job
good,Being at Amazon has taught me a lot. I love the people that i work with and there is never a dull moment. But just like all jobs they have there picks. Management is always nice and friendly. Ready to help in anyway they can.Amazon is a pie job if you are willing to put in the work. You go to work do your job and go home. There is always something to do everyday so you are never bored. The most enjoyable part is all hands meetings. Getting to know where we stand as a company each month is really enjoyable to me.
good,"A very pleasant workplace and which enables us tio learn more about leadership skills . Very good management with supportive and enthusiastic co-workers. A place where no one bosses around or none one compels you what to do. But at end of the day , you are responsible for the work you do. "
good,"Very Good Experience. "
good,good place to work with good benifits only problem is the lack of any kind of background noise that makes for very long shifts of silence

good,"Amazon is still a hard working place -- the company's motto is ""work hard, have fun, make history*,"" and the order of those items is no accident."
good,"A typical day working for Lopez Party Rentals lots of craft activities and being around lots of people."
good,"I loved working at Amazon. The people and the culture made it an ideal place to be everyday. It was stressful during peak but I really enjoyed being able to assist people and I was very good at calming stressed people. I really learned alot about keeping my cool and making the upset and angry customer calm and happy. I struggled in one area only, getting positive responses from customers. I helped them and they were happy, but not many people fill out the surveys and my job depended on it."
good,The environment was very friendly. It is a very diverse company as well. You will meet all kinds of different people working with Amazon.
good,"Great place to work, I learned excellent customer service skills up there and how to put the customer first. All the staff were amazing, helpful and friendly, including managers and operations."
good,"Amazon is a very customer-centric company. It is very important to treat the customer as a friend and provide the best experience possible. They also believe in providing the same experience for their employees. They have a quiet room (allows you to take a time out), game lounge (breaks and down time), and lots of lunches and activities for the employees throughout the month."
good,"This is a great company to work for with great benefits. People are friendly and the company listens to the employees.  The hours can be long, but the over all outlook at the company is fast pace and friendly."
good,This company has showed me alot of potential and mastered my skills. But as for growing in the company is extremely difficult to obtain. Favoritism is outstanding and not fair. Favoritism is everywhere but for this company it is ridiculous. What ever happen to Team work and Team Players.
good,I did picking items by scanner i make the orders for the costumers it was very nice job me and I would like to do again this job this job was temporary for the Christmas period in this job I scan the bar codes of the items I check if is damage and I putting in totes
good,"I worked remotely with this position. I would bring all the systems required up and prepare for login. Sometimes their programs were outdated and would disconnect but I found ways to keep refreshing it. We had 15 minutes to review emails and follow up on any call backs to customers. I learned their systems and how different customer interactions were around the holidays. Management was the kindest I've ever encountered and extremely helpful under all circumstances. The most difficult part of the job was the systems that went down ever so often, probably due to all of the traffic on the programs at once. I truly enjoyed making the customers happy during the holidays and interacting with my team via chat but still feeling very connected."
good,"Sono molto contenta di aver lavorato presso Amazon, il lavoro certo è pesante, ma è un ottimo ambiente di lavoro, lo consiglierei a tutti!"
good,"I worked at Amazon (Phx 6) for about 6 weeks. I started work general at 7:30 am and looked on the board to see where I was working for the day.  I stowed items off what they call a u-boat.  This contains items to be scanned and put on the shelves.  I also learned how to received incoming goods and put them on the u-boat."

good,"Learn so many diverse things at work. Meet all kinds of people in area."
good,"A typical day at work included that CPT's was out on time, starting at half 8, 9 and 10pm then 12 midnight and 4am. This was a critical role as if any shipments was missed I had to find out where they were. I learned really good communication skills in this role. Management were not all that good. They gave a beginning of shift brief and that was all we really saw of them. Co-workers was one of the best things about the job, most were really nice, approachable people willing to help any way they can. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with people that spoke little English. The most enjoyable part of the job was most problems were different at each person I saw."
good,"It is productive, exciting, interesting place to work at with different type of product and management. The management team make the place a fun place to work with different type of music to listen to and keep us safe in our environment. My coworker are friendly, and kind to other they will help you out if you need a hand. The hardest part of my job is making sure that my rate is at 100% and the down stacking of the product before they goes in the rack."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of myself being productive by stow, packing and working the docks. There is always work to be done and I choose to work more even if I was not asked to do so. I learned how major corporation operates, and how management is run. I have noticed some of my co workers were lazy and uneducated. the most enjoyable part of my job was moving to different departments and expanding my knowledge."
good,"11 hour night shifts, using a scanner I would collect all items that would come up on my scanner and I would put them onto a metal tote and send them off to the packaging team to be shipped out. My co-workers were all so easy to get along with and we would all have entertaining conversations to make our shift easier and more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was walking 10-12 miles a night, at first your feet and legs are sore and ache but once you get used to it, you find it's rewarding you're in such an active job because you would be keeping fit and losing weight."
good,"HR sucks, miss the people I worked with. I worked my butt off and was able to excel. Training was awesome"
good,I liked working here cause the work environment was very different from any other job I worked at. I loved cooking the food and providing customer service to the guest. The fact that their culture is all around in the store environment is a plus as well.
good,I really like working here the coworkers are fun and makes the night go by fast but on the other hand the company is built around numbers. in my department they stress the 2 quotas we have to meet so bad that they will write u up so much if u cant or don't meet them that they will fire u before your 90 days is up.
good,"As an employee I never regretted to be a part of Amazon, in fact I am so proud to be an Amazonian. "

good,"Amazon has great benefits, management is great, just the overall environment is great. its not like any other warehouse. There are a lot of job advancement opportunities."
good,I would walk in to work every day with a positive attitude of a higher then expected rate and productivity management would always come by to let me know how well or bad I was doing an make sure everything was going well as far as daily tasks and rates many stowers are also required to display bin educate which is organization of bins used by the stower
good,I loved my work at Amazon. Advancement was great and the Management staff was A+.

good,"A typical day at work is about 35k units to scan and ship at Amazon."
good,No place is perfect but my stay at Amazon was a good one. The people there are great and feels more like a family. Management can be unorganized a little and a bit pushy during peak season.
good,"Its pretty good but challenging job work in Amazon. Start up planning help employees to make day plan to work, which is nice. It has cross-training facility to hep employee to learn more and be productive. I have learned how to process a quality customer order and process them as earliest possible. Management does the Employee rating which helps us to improve our quality work and helps develop the work environment. Management and Co-workers are very friendly and pretty much helpful. Some times i had to carry cases of 50 and 60 pounds which I felt the difficult but very rare I had to do that one though."
good,Hot job got to like ouside work and be willing to work long hours
good,"A day at Amazon.com can be described as Non-Stop work and Fun. "
good,"a normal day to get to Amazon, was first to arrive early meeting of the working group and ralajacion exercise of muscle, very good indeed helped a lot, very safe environment full of work that I loved ...."
good,"Typical day at work is somewhat steady.  Learned how to run every piece of machinery on the job.  Became an Ambassador at Amazon to train new employees on how to perform certain processes.  Co-workers are not very lively, they don't care about what they have to do at work.  I enjoy working with certain people who are up beat and care about making sure the job gets done."
good,"A typical day at work was always fast and working non stop. I learned how to operate different machinery. They always had the option of cross training for different positions. Management here was very bad, they were always switching to new managers all the time. The managers were always rude and not fair with everybody. All my co-workers were always nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job was trying to make the rate but I did most of the time. The most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers."
good,"I really enjoyed the time i work here. Great culture, they really do take care of their employees and you have a lot of options to work with different projects and people."
good,"i would go in talk to my friends at the time clock "
good,"AMZN has a strong data driven culture, many people there have engineer or quant background, and they make decisions based on data. At AMZN, you could expect to work with many smart and nice guys."
good,Plenty of monthly activities and you learn a lot about working in a big warehouse environment. You always will love your co-workers because the help you in every way to a team accomplishment to earn extra certificates.
good,High volume accounts payable.  Hard working team.  A lot of time was freed up after system conversion (paperless).
good,great place. growth opportunity is less for level lesser than a manager
good,"Amazon is one of the best companies we would like to work with. The work environment is amazing with all multi talented individuals. This company give us the freedom to think and work as the tag line of the company Work Hard, Have Fun and Make History."
good,I worked as a problem solver for other employees. Kind of like a help desk posiotion with a computer on wheels going around the huge warehouse and fixing tickets for employees due to order issues or customer issues.
good,"I loved working at Amazon in ph8, the hardest part was when the items were coming down the line very fast with few people on the line."

good,I enjoyed working for amozon it was a fun and productive place to work. I love working as a team.

good,"warehouse worker, it was a cold amd hot place. Lots of workers worked there"
good,"while the work is good "
good,"some days lots of mandatory overtime work other days not enough work, around holidays make sure you let your family know you will be home late"
good,"Working for Amazon is great and everyone is very respectful and polite. Entry level position compensation is difficult to make things work when you have to provide for family. Promotions are often since company is growing fast, however there is a lot of competition. Learning the value of connecting with the customers has been a great experience as opposed to just following policy."
good,Tougher job with actual targets. hectic work conditions. from there i learnt about time management with actual target levels.
good,I don't have much bad to say about amazon. They seem to genuinely care about their employees. They have great benefits and emphasize on safety. Most of the employees are all really nice. The only part I can say is a downfall for them is they don't get onto the employees who don't strive to do their best at their job. Most of the promotions are based on seniority so even though someone has terrible rates and always slacks at their job if they've been here longer they have a better chance at being bumped up. I've been with SDF8 since they opened in oct. so I have quite a bit of seniority but I also worked hard to move up as I have so I feel it unfair that others who worked half as much get the same perks.
good,It is a company that identifies and rewards its employees appropriately. But the level of effort to put it way higher than any other company known.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Amazon.  The job was never the same on any given day.  I was able to train on several different positions.  The managers, in my opinion, were always fair and never just assumed something happened.  I would really like to join this company again and prove that I am as good as I say I am.  I think I can make a company like this grow and expand into a company that anyone and everyone would enjoy working with."
good,"Great place to work, lots of opportunity and intelligent staff!"
good,taking in returns getting them off palletsand entering in rf scanneri learned how to work rf scannerlooking up items and them not in the right place
good,"Everyday is energy packed with full of fun. We start the day with a bang like a group War Cry, rush back to our stations and do our work.."
good,"I would arrive at 7:30am starting the day with lt. stretches, sign ito function for the day. My job related to production : pick, pack place on ship line, restock pack stations and proublem solving daily needs of customer orders. We had a total of 3 stress times in the day where the Mang. showed there commitment to getting the orders filled. Was able to work in a friendly enviroment, meetting , talking , getting to know my fellow workers , While productivly working. Overall my job at Amazon was an awesome experience , learned the warehouse work ethics, stowing , packing and placement to customers with follow up to confirm receivement . "
good,I love working for Amazon I am currently a temporary employing in the middle of being converted. The pay is great. The management and other employees are helpful and have great attitudes. I stay busy throughout my entire shift. Like that we have 3 days off in a row and overtime is almost always offered or mandatory which makes for more money :)
good,One day at work we had to set a new goal in our quality rate%.
good,I loved it and the only bad thing was that it was seasonal. Worked from home. Had full 2 week training with pay. Fun and friendly co-workers and great pay.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Amazon. it is a very fast paced work environment. It can be physically demanding at times, but the people you meet there are friendly and our team leaders were very optimistic, motivated and energetic."
good,"I basically over saw the store and the employees on my shift . The general manager was rarely ever there so, I usually closed the stores and , distributed the checks on pay day. If a customer ever had an request issue or problem while being assisted by employees under me I made sure that I made the customer feel right . The hardest part was making all of the employees believe that all of the customers are always right even when they are wrong."
good,a lot of communication help and team work able to pick pack and stow needed to go punch in meet with manager and then start working
good,"A typical day was taking phone calls from customers that needed help with their kindles. I learned alot about kindles and how to do troubleshooting. Management was great. They were all easy to work with and always had a solution. Since everything was in a virtual setting, it was hard to really get to know my co-workers, however, when I was able to interact with them, they were all great people. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn all the technical part of doing tablets and phones that had the kindle app on them. To me the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to my customers and treating them like friends."
good,"Working for Amazon.com was such a great experience for me. I loved it, it was a consistent amount of hours and a set schedule every week. They have amazing culture for the company being as big as they are, they strive to provide an amazing environment and amazing training for their associates so that they in turn can provide the best customer service to their customers. I loved working there as I have said before, unfortunately I had to resign from my position so that I could finish my school. They try to be very flexible for school and their employees to continue their education but you can only do so much while working around a schedule for school. I would definitely go back to Amazon.com if I was given the opportunity."
good,a very hard position to keep but overall its easy to become attached like family to your coworkers. the managers were easy to get along with and helped out when crunch time came. the most enjoyable part of the job was the holiday parties and picnics. the hardest part was making the rate when they change them.

good,-My tipical day at work is normally long and boring
good,"A very good place to work, from the people to the mangement, bonus incentives, good hours, overtime, paid time off, the only drawback is you have to get in through a Staffing Agency, very hard to do, but would do it all over again just to try and get hired full time."
good,sort thru items and scan them in their bins walk miles throughout the day to fullfill customers needs for merchandise to be packaged and shipped out
good,"I absolutely love working with the people, but I have to have stable and better pay. All the people I work with and for are amazing!!!"
good,"goal driven, and good competition between day shift and might shift."
good,"it was a great company to work for/with. there were all types of product that the warehouse carried. even stuff that i didnt know existed. there was constant competition within the employees on rates, it has its pros and cons."
good,picking and packing
good,"A typical day at work was answering the phone ans assisting customers with orders and website help. As well as assisting customers with Kindle tech support, replacing Kindles and placing orders for new Kindles. The people I worked with were fun, and management was down to earth and easy to talk to about anything no matter if it was work related or in your personal life."
good,"Nice environment to work at. Friendly people. Also a nice way to exercise because you had to walk a lot during the day to get to one place from another. I also like the schedule they had, but i think an hour lunch instead of 30 minute lunch woul;d have been better."
good,"Buena , con gran equipo de trabajo, buenos compañeros y buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"The tasks at hand are not the most confusing, however labor is the main battle an employee has to suffer as the work is quite long with complete motion all throughout."
good,Enjoyed Amazon WFM Prime Shopping. Company and staff was great. If you enjoy grocery shopping this would be the perfect job. Nice hours and shifts. Highly recommend.
good,"The job is fast paced, you have to keep moving, bending and squirting. Good for people who like moving fast and meeting targets. Just like most warehouses, you would be on your feet most of the time. There is a very quick room for growth and you can transfer within departments as long as you are a giod employee."
good,One thing I dont like is they get of good workers and leave people who could care less still hired. I've seen some awesome go. But overall I love working at Amazon
good,Amazon has amazing benefit plans. Several accommodations are available. Flexible work hours if needed. Many opportunities to advance. Definitely would recommend.

good,"Good and they suppirt each and everyone."
good,"the culture at amazon is very up-beat and friendly. the job is tough at times being on your feet and moving for 8 hours, but the pay and people you work with makes it worth it. they also often have opportunities to pick up more shifts as I was a part time employee- the extra money was great around the holidays"
good,I was in Amazon for 3 months in .com site. I liked the job culture and all the employees but the security in the job is the one thing that has to be taken care of.
good,"mi sono trovato molto bene, amazon aiuta a crescere lavorativamente parlando"
good,"Day starts with assigned work and we as a team will start working on that issue and make sure the PDP for every product is looking best and with all necessary details."
good,I wordke in Amazon it was a great experiance for me in Germany. Their job security is too good. I enjoyed a lot there.
good,amazon is very fexiable with sSchedules and very helpful and kind very manageable  work. Great pay with Add on I would recommend working with Amazon company again
good,Love the culture and fun place to work. Fast growing work pace keeps you busy.pay raises are not the greatest. Amazon has alot to offer come join the team.
good,A typical day for me starts at 7:00am with a team meeting on how to better improve production some words of encouragement and some safety tips. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and keeping your energy up all day to keep up with the pace of things but its not impossible
good,"facilidad de palabra , conocimiento de otras ciudades como el cajon city, spring valley, la mesa entre otras, falicidad de trato con las personas, habilidad de uso del gps, mejor desenvolvimiento del idioma ingles"
good,The job is pretty much straight forward you get your scan gun sign in grab a cart and a tote start scanning and pulling items for the order on the screen.

good,"Great Benefits, and also a great place to work for.  They are a global company, so you can transfer to a lot of different countries.  I would definitely recommend working there, or even investing in their stock purchase plan."
good,"Amazon ha sido quien me dio ese empujon para poder entrar en el mundo laboral de la logística y he aprendido a trabajar bajo precion y a manejar la pistola con radiofrecuencia sin problemas, en un ambiente laboral muy bueno y con compañeros estupendos eso parece una familia."
good,i have great experience  while working with amazon
good,I loved working here while it lasted and truly enjoyed going to work everyday when I worked here. Very friendly and knowledgeable people who come together and strive to achieve greatness as a team.
good,"Great shift options are available when the fulfillment centers are hiring for their busier seasons. Hours are bearable for the pay, especially after the wage increase. Premiums for night shifts. The only downside is that seasonal employees are less likely to get hired on as permanent employees, so before the season is up, make sure you have something else lined up!"
good,"Working at amazon it has the good and bad but being a seasonal Pa , there is always endless amount of work to be done.  Always learning new things everyday and able to cross train into other paths."
good,"Lots of performance expectations , beautiful warehouse , good work environment not too loud and great support from supervisors great opportunity for advancing"
good,"O único problema que tive foi nessa área porque os colegas de trabalho se preocupa muito no fato de perder o emprego,então quando vê uma pessoa realizando as tarefas melhor que eles fazem de tudo pra derrubar pra não ser substituído"
good,"As an associate in a distribution center, you will be constantly in motion and on your feet for your entire shift. This job is not for anyone who is lazy or likes to fly under the radar at work. You will be monitored and measured during nearly every task you undertake. There is some pressure to not be ""at the bottom"" and those who have the best performance numbers will be singled out for praise."
good,"We download the trucks, package were scanned and also by routes."
good,"Love to make sure customers stay happy, to makes sure that all of the customers get their packages reviewed and looked at all the way and if refund is needed thats what they shall get."
good,It is great place to work if you are able to be on your feet for 10 hours. Long hours and fast paced could take your all energy and disturb your physical and mental health

good,Perfect bonne attente et bon contact avec les leader et les manager expérience très bien à refaire
good,"This Company is one of the best company's in the world, also they have good benefits,but the workplace very clean and organize.The hardest part working at amazon is lifting packages over 80 pounds or more, also what i learned about working at amazon is working hard and pushing yourself to the next level, therefore our workplace culture is very respectful, all cultures gets along very well. the most enjoyable part working at amazon is communicating with others."
good,"The Work is competitive in the pick department, It's very fast paced, But It because easy once you get the hang of it. There are a few things that are not fair here and there. But the pay was good."

good,"The management is good . The first day of working there , they explained step by step and took their time to make sure we knew what needed to be done."
good,I really like this job overall in general. I didn’t want to leave the job but I had to resign due to not have a babysitter at the time. I now have one so i am currently looking for another job to be dedicated too.
good,"Very flexible work schedule, good management, and overall was able to grow with the company. Also had really good training before you start with them which made it easier to understand what the goals were."
good,"You're always able to move to other departments and be cross-trained. There are lots of events that they put on to keep the employees entertained, and always ways to make more money."
good,It a fast paced work environment. with two breaks one is paid and the other is unpaid. lunch room has a market style with vending machines plenty room
good,This company was very exciting to work at. At the beginning of each shift we use to have body warm ups and motivational speech to get us started. The management were very helpful in shift and in person. We all gave each other encouragement everyday.The environment was clean and in order. This was the best job I've worked in a warehouse setting.
good,"It was fun working at Amazon as season associate, though I did get paid less then a full-time associate. Although it's understandable why and they give you a chance to be a full-time associate. As you work season."

good,"Professional,fast paced, fun and competitive environment. It built my stamina for working and standing long hours I personally felt my capabilities and capacity got better and they do acknowledge your efforts"
good,"It is a great company to work for. They have flexible hours and have great managers to work with. Right now there is alot more going on during the night shift or early morning shift. This is just A new location so there is alot still getting figured out and organized. There you work as a team, with great people."
good,"Food is offered for lunch two or three times a year. Prizes are also offered."
good,It was a very difficult job on the body. I would walk 20-30 miles a day for 10 hours a day. The biggest benefit by far was the incredible shape I got in after working there for over 3 years!
good,At Amazon it is fairly easy to move up the corporate ladder. It offers paid time off as well as vacation time off. If you are willing to relocate you can advance very quickly.
good,"You don't get full medical as a part time, but you do get up to $500.00 a year to help with medical cost.Overall still love working for this company. Management is always on site, If you have a concern, they make it to a  point to bring up issues in stand up. Most of the employees get to be cross trained. If you want to learn something they make sure you get the knowledge. The hardest part would be the hours of the shift, it works for some then it also doesnt work for others."
good,A great place to learn skills for life which you will carry forwards at every stage henceforth. It's a place for people who are optimistic and enthusiastic to learn.
good,"Ambiente dinamico e giovane, tutto lo staff è pronto ad aiutare i dipendenti per qualsiasi problema "
good,You moving around a lot it’s a big environment you can win prizes for just coming to work we have this thing called stand up we talk to each other and stretch and lots of people to get to know

good,"Good coordination at low level and high-level management."
good,"Amazon is one of the fastest growing brands. "
good,This job kept me on top of my game and moving in a fast pace also the benefits we're good.The only bad part about this company was that it was a far travel for me because I live in Brooklyn and worked in Staten island
good,"If you are delivering packages it is a challegning job. Everyday their will be something new or different. The work environment is fun because the amount of work you receive can vary. Once your out of the station with your loaded van you become your own boss, and you interact with customers on a daily basis."
good,Good experience amazon is what you make it everyone has their days you dealing with multiple personalities every day just be a person who thinks out the box
good,I worked pulling pallets of boxes ready to be shipped.  Placing them at the proper bay doors where the truck drivers would pick up the pallets.  I also learned how to inventory products on the pallets to make sure they went to the proper place.  I worked a graveyard shift in Kent WA.  My managers were nice helped me when I needed It.  There were lots of floor people to help you out if you needed It.  I really liked my job.
good,"I bring a powerful energy coming into working in the morning. Coworkers want to work with me, because I take any job given to me very seriously. Once my task has been given I give more than 100% with or without a partner."

good,Amazing work culture and a great place to work. The management is open to suggestions and truly work on the feedback given. Great place to start your career.
good,One of the best companies I have ever been with or have had the pleasure of working for. Advancement opportunity was mininal at the time of this review but the company does it's best as far as balancing work/life.
good,It’s growing environment and understanding them members and helping the company grow and deliver fast placement and they treat you like family and like they care
good,I give Amazon a A.  The work environment is great.  I love the people that I work with.  The benefits are second to none.  I would recommend Amazon as a place to work.
good,It was a good work experience and environment. The hours they have will fit any schedule you have.....................................................
good,I liked the job and the staff. They kept the facility clean and very well organized. Employee satisfaction was important and everyone's opinions were taken into account.
good,"I tjourougly enjoyed working for this company. It was my home away from home. However being a single parent with a new born baby , the hours worked against ne. But I do recommend the company any day."
good,Amazon was amazing to work but the field I worked was tiring It was Customer Service. But the management and the atmosphere was indeed amazing. The work culture was also one of the best.
good,Safety rules and daily communication of what is taking place. The company have great benefits. they train everyone to be able to handle their jobs. Great experience wit all major contacts
good,"i would recommend this job to those who want to be on their feet the whole shift working with packages bending reaching, can be a workout and you are sore the first week or two but it is an easy going hard working job."
good,"Very nice management,"
good,"Excellent job hard work but pays off, the job entitles to do picking and packing using a scanner to scan the items and pick the items from the shelf and put into a box and give the box of items to the packers etc etc"
good,"Amazon is a really good job they have nice hours, and great pay I would recommend anyone to work there and they have good benefits, you can also pick your schedule and the times you would like to work so I think that’s pretty cool to"
good,It was nice to work at home and my job was primarily dealing with amazon drivers rather than customers so it was far more comfortable than usual for a call center job.
good,Just come and do what is needed to be done by you Learn to do other things The work is pretty easy just a lot of standing on your feet for 10 hours. You get to meet people from different cultures. Been working for Amazon now for 3 years
good,Love to work but it's just 12 hours shift. Great benefit and good management. Cooperative co workers and flexibility of time. Always encourage to be better at work and help to get trained on other facilities and departments l.
good,Amazon has flexibilty and they have great benefits with 401K savings. Work atmosphere is great and team members are very helpful and supportive. Managment is okay.
good,"This job is a fast paced job. It is about 8-9 miles of walking per day. You do not have time to mess around and you have to keep going steadily. If you are not a self motivated person then this is not the job for you. I truly loved the job but physically jumping in and out of that van, over 150 stops a day, this was rough on my knees. I would of loved to stay with Amazon as a big company but there was no way for me to move up in the company. I did try numerous times but you can not switch jobs easily. The team was so great and if your energetic this is the job for you!"
good,an extraordinary and operational work environment every time
good,I loved working here. I only wish it had a better job security system. It was a work from home position so the dress code was whatever you slept in or whatever you wanted to wear.
good,Amazon was a great company to work for with great benefits and a understanding of people and family and safe working environment open door if you have issues they willing to to listen and help.
good,"Working for Amazon as a fulfillment associate is a 7 to 5 work day, 4 days a week with 3 days off. The benefits go in the day of orientation, and the overall work experience is nothing light nor anything to take lightly. When you keep a good pace and rhythm with your work load, you'll find yourself completing your tasks and fulfilling your daily quotas. Do expect a lot of walking and standing so be sure you have the correct footwear and posture to endure the day. The cafeteria is stocked with lunch items in case you dont bring one, and has storage fridges for when you do."
good,Its really interesting to know the buying experience from the Amazon side. No one imagines what goes beyond the easy keyboard or smartphone order placing. The logistics are as amazing as the company's background.
good,"Flexible hours and great communication!"
good,Mi sono trovato bene sia con I colleghi che con I superiori sempre disponibili a venirti incontro e ascoltarti
good,"this job is perfect for people who need  FEW extra hours a week for extra income. the culture is diverse, and the pace is fast. you'll definitely get your workout"
good,"Productive and working with great team."
good,"Working at amazon is really fast paced but along with this they have a lot of fun activities to keep their employers refreshed such as table tennis and  other fun loving and stress relieving games. Along with this, they make their employees to perform exercises before commencing their work and after break intervals so that they are physically fit."
good,It started off easy but you will be tested on your work work productivity. You need to have a certain rate to complete your job so be ready to find your flow to keep up your productivity.
good,Everyone I worked with was really nice.  I never felt stressed going into work.  Amazon holds safety to a high standard.  I always felt safe and comfortable in the workplace.
good,No interview but instead a group orientation on site. It was general labor that I had to do. Could get competitive at times when raffles or gift cards are given away. Lively environment. There are group stretching at the beginning of every shift.
good,I was there part time and loved it.  There is alot to learn there but the people in charge help you all they can.  I worked there for 6 months until they got rid of all their part time employees.  They even gave me severance pay for being there.  What company does that now a days?  It is an excellent place to work and wish they'd have kept all the part timers.  I would recommend this job to anyone seeking a good full time job with benefits.
good,"All I can say is that they really did everuthing they could to help me thru a personal situation I had that was severly affecting my work , although there really wasnt anything they could do to change what I had going on , I was pleased that they at least tried"
good,I love this job. Been here for 2 months.  Pay is great and so is the benefits. If you let them know your having a problem they’ll really work with you. 5 stars from me.
good,"Amazon was the Best place to work at especially considering the fact that it was the first time I worked at the call center. I learnt quite a lot over a short period of time. There’s a lot Of growth aswell if you work hard/smart enough."
good,Amazon is a great place to work at and I've been enjoying it since I started working there. It was a challenge getting there since there is no Public Transportation in Bolton at the moment. I've since then found my way there and made sure I am always prepared to work.
good,I had an exciting at amazon it was truly a new begining and something different and I was quite surprised at the order that came in and the stuff that was being order.
good,"•	Expertise in leading, motivating & controlling the Human Resource ensuring zero defects."

good,I loved working with amazon everyone was so nice and happy I will work there again as a full time employee not part time I enjoyed working with people
good,I enjoyed my time working at Amazon. The work was fast paced and there was plenty of it. I'd recommend it to anyone as there's plenty of benefits from working here although it's not a leisurely job. You're constantly moving and doing heavy physical labor for many hours at a time. The people I worked with were pleasant and overall a great experience!
good,I loved my time at Amazon. Nothing but positive things to say about the overall company. Each department has its pluses and minuses but overall the best company I've ever worked for.
good,Amazon helped mold me into an amazing professional. I wouldn't change a thing about my experience here. The people that I've had the opportunity to work with became family. I'm happy to take what I've learned and to use it wherever I go. I can help another company or another professional or just to use what I have and evolve into something better. Amazon was a great experience.
good,"Great benefits. The shift was challenging to have a social life. The department was new, and the policies and structure were all over the place. Training was challenging"
good,il difficile e' sostituire la notte al giorno.altre cose non ci sono
good,"This job was a fast-paced job. It required a lot of on the job learning. We all learned from each other which made it easier. There was a lot of pressure of get all the deliveries done before the end of the day so the pressure was always on. But since we worked together as a team, we worked together to get it all done. That was the greatest thing about working at Amazon, the teamwork!"
good,"Amazon is a good place to work, You have schedule flexibility if you have a second job you can schedule yourself around your second job or just work on weekends. Some times it hard to go on shifts, but if somebody give up a shift it becomes available and management will put that shift back out to be picked up again. The work is not hard but you will work from the time you get in until the time you leave its a lot of standing, bending, kneeling, climbing on a ladder, picking up 40 lbs or less. Its a place where you can get in and work and go home and not worry about work until you come back to work. You don't take it home with you."
good,"Si lavora sempre in sicurezza, anche se con una notevole intensità. E' un lavoro per pochi: se non si ha voglia di lavorare si dura poco."
good,"This was my first job in the corperate and I should tell you, I have had the best time and this experience has taught me the ways I can explore and the path to choose in which I am interestted in."
good,Amazon is a great place to work. It is dynamic and there is always opportunity to learn new things and advance. I have progressed from a Seasonal employee to a full-time member of the team.
good,"It’s a decent job to have, but it works best as a weekend thing to do or an off day job. You do have to be on your feet most of the time when it’s super busy, but when it’s not you have time to sit relax and some coworkers who are students do homework."
good,"Long hours, Great discounts, Management always helped out when ever it was and was not needed. Always something to do, alot of room to grow in the company."
good,No pressure on job work very appropriate paste.good intynery step by step. Lots of time to deliver packages well organized system. Finish as fast as you do your deliveries!
good,"I worked here twice - for short duration. But I still want to work for it. This is because I feel at home in this co. They respect you, not just as an employee,  but as a human being. That's their forte - employee satisfaction is almost at 100%.:)"
good,Amazon is nice place to work friendly Management and Employee are help and comfortable work environment.Amazon has training for just about anything that associate with the company there room for advancing everyone is team players.i will recommend this job for people that just starting or student that just starting out working as entry level.
good,"There is nothing negative that I can say about working at Amazon. It is one of the best organizations that I have ever worked for. With the exception of some senior managers, I would not trade my experience for anything. The only incentive to look elsewhere is to get away from the toxic senior manager running my organization."
good,"Amazon is one of the good company which supports employees to grow in their career and help in to improve their learning skills."
good,5 estrellas en todo lo que tiene que ver con ambiente laboral y condiciones laborales
good,"I sort and scan packages to pallets that will be shipped to various cities I also lift, transport, and pallet jack both big and small packages to 4 different assembly lines throughout Amazon warehouse"
good,a fast paced work environment for which you stow packages to areas that get sent to their destination great management. They care for the safety of the workers
good,Show up and do your work..it's like a typical day at work I like. I will apply again. My hours got cut short and they and didn't have any this else available to get more hours. However I am a good worker and was asked to come back to rejoin the team.
good,I really enjoyed working at Amazon. I worked with some really intelligent people who all shared the philosophy of customer first.  A big principle there is putting yourself in the shoes of a customer and let that guide your decision.
good,El trabajo y ambiente laboral es muy bueno el inconveniente es que no es un trabajo estable
good,"A typical day as an amazon associate depends on your assignment to the building. 10 hours a day with breaks and lunch time appropriately based on shift . Can learn a lot of about almost any role in the building if you are interested and willing to ask questions.  Goal are met as a team with the priorities of a safe, efficient, and constantly improving nature. Managers Build you up as there are always opportunities for promotions. Always incentives for showing up and employee appreciation, as well as, fun days to wear and dress up. Shifts Speed by as you are always engaged with work. Thanksgiving to Christmas give big opportunities for over-time."
good,Hard work but rewarding. Average walking was 12 miles a day or more. Awesome team environment. Great benefits. Opportunity for advancement if you’re flexible and willing to move.
good,one of the best company  have worked for. hours are there to work the pace is fast and you have HR on site. advancement is not so easy but the pay is competitive.
good,"granted you get paid on the low end of what would be the amount of a pse clerk at the post office, but the fact that they are willing to work with your scheduled, they don't rush and are extremely kind at least my bosses are. the only complaint I would have is right now because they are relatively new they can't offer advancements or higher pay yet. when they get their they would be five stars all around."
good,"I wanna come back, I only left because of the pay, but now they pay more and the benefits are better, I forgot to send the computer back (I was moving left it in storage) not eligible for rehire"
good,"Good pay, great breakroom, fast paced and competitive during the holiday season. Managers are easy to get along with and they make it fun, especially on the inbound side of BWI5"
good,"Toughest place to succeed. As a leader you really need to exemplify all 14 Amazon Leadership principles to be successful. What I enjoyed most is you own your business, success and failures as an Amazon Leader."
good,If you want part time work Amazon is a good place to go. You can work what schedule you want providing they have a need at that time. Plenty of hours during holiday season.
good,Would love to work back at Amazon good roles good company to work for. Pay is good. Break service was very good. Overall a good company to work for...
good,Productive and fast-paced environment with motivational managers. It required a sense of belonging and a competitive spirit. The staff was always helpful and available.
good,"Great guidance, proper management, proper equipment for work, salary, night shift allowance and over time allowance is enough for a person to survive and have fun."
good,"Its good pay, but hard on your body in the fulfillment locations.   The fulfillment centers are enormous and you will be constantly walking,lifting, bending etc. The sorting centers are a bit easier.  If you are hired on as a regular worker not a temp. They give you benefits from day 1, paid time off, vacation,  and other discounts."
good,A very easy going job with day to day routes. One can decide its own hours and work when ever one wants. The staff is very helpful and the online support is always there to help you once on a route.
good,Overall it was a great learning experience great ppl great company met some new friends and ppl from across the country! Will def do it again if the chance arise
good,"The job is a good one to have and is easy. Flexible hours and decent pay (could be better)."
good,Loved to b a part of the company n its services. Wish to have get more feasible in coming days which assure the confidence of employee and moreover may be beneficial for the company itself.
good,I enjoyed working there. It's fast-paced so time goes by fast. You do have targets you have to reach so you need to move. It gets really cold at night.
good,"Be prepared to work hard. The group of people I work with are great! If you need help all you have to do is ask. I just feel it’s a great job, I’m lucky to have awesome management and other employees that are higher up, or have more insight and experience than I do, but the key is asking."
good,Amazon has a unique approach to work environment.  It is relaxed but not too relaxed where you forget you have a boss.  The management knows you are a person and approaches you as such.  They are fair and treat their employees the best that I have been treated in my work career (govt and non govt jobs).
good,go in and get your scanner listen to PA tell you what to do and not to do so you don't get injured next log in to scanner and get ready to go pick items out of bin for customer orders
good,"I have the privilege of working with a great group of people. I enjoy the work I do. If you like a very fluid and fast paced work, this is the place for you. After one year of employment amazon offers job advancements and education benefits are impressive."
good,Very flexible and fast paced. They help when needed and can always pick up extra shifts. Time goes by fast when busy and holidays will really be that way
good,For me Amazon is where anyone who expect be successful will want to work. The company roles and regulations really care about workers career and their future.
good,It was definitely a challenging job with having to work 10 hours a day minimum but the pay is worthwhile. You also get to learn different areas of the job and can climb up the ladder.
good,I liked it there but was seasonal and we worked from home so had a lot of computer work to learn and working in chat rooms to get questions answered and to speak.to supervisors

good,"Great pay with no experience required"
good,"Typical work schedule for my shift was Wednesday-Saturday, 6:30PM - 5 AM. Was very fast-paced if you wanted to make rates. Online website to manage Paid-Time off hours and stocks was very up-to-date. Environment itself was sort of impersonal and definitely felt like a warehouse. Otherwise, a great place to work."
good,"The job was simple, just highly stressful because of the difficult quotas and absurd guidelines. Working hours were long and absolutely no time for yourself or your own life, unless you get time off. If you’re a workaholic, this job is for you."

By resolving their problems we will be able to learn how to manage the customer service and improve the customer satisfaction.
good,"Overall Amazon was a fun, and challenging place to work. Sometimes it can be hard and other times it can be easy. It is a very dynamic work environment so things can go uphill or downhill really quickly. But the work culture at my building was great everyone got the job done while having fun and that's what made it a fun place to work for me was all the people I met while working there. I gave management a neutral rating due to the fact that some managers were understanding, and cooperative, but others weren't the work is a lot easier with a manager that knows how to help you out when you need something from their end."
good,Work environment its very busy but I learnt a lot. The management and the people  I work with was very helpful. I will definitely go back to work with the Amazon again when I am ready.

No exceptions it's a warehouse so your focus has to be on your job if you dont understand that Amazon is not a fit for you.

good,"My entire experience, from training and learning the building. I enjoyed my time of employment. I learned a lot of time management skills and communication skills."

good,Amazon is a great place to work with but due to management decisions things took a toll and I decided to shift for growth and better opportunities. Amazon has an amazing place to understand how to enjoy work at workplace.
good,"In my position, I have to work independently, with very little supervision.  There are several job functions that I can be assigned with each giving you a different challenge."
good,My application for Amazon was similar to the assessment test on your website.  I was given customer scenarios and multiple choice answers.  I enjoy customer service. I feel comfortable in my position working from home. I've been in customer service long enough to not need a lot of coaching. The one drawback to Amazon is how quickly leadership changes. I've had 20 team managers in the three years I've been with the company.
good,Good people around and nice place to work. Shift timings is also good and flexible with work.  Relaxation in n dress code though we are into shared services which is good
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, they started with 5 days a week for 4 hours a day 2:45 am- 06:45 am that was the perfect hours for me"
good,cool enviroment and nice staff members and coworkers everyone is respectable and kind. I really enjoyed working here because I felt comfortable enough to ask for help when it was needed.
good,"I loved working at amazon great company and great co workers but the only problem I had was my manager he wouldn't let me move up or consider me for another position and he put me in a position that was unfair and where if u made a lot of mistakes you would get fired or in trouble, it was a very strict department and I did not like it at all and it was very unreasonable, but aside from that amazon was a very great place to work at it was just unfortunate that I didnt have a good manager he wasn't bad but he could've been better."
good,"All the staff were great and respectful. Every morning managers and ambassadors would great everyone and ask how we are doing.  The people who work there are friendly and if not, managers try to work to make everyone feel comfortable."

good,"Manager was very hard to work with, but overall the culture was great to work there. They do have the ability to work you really hard and have high expectations."
good,Amazon is a good company overall. I do feel that there are some places for improvement such as the training style. I feel there should be more training and updates to make sure that people understand what is required of them. The atmosphere is ever-changing. The higher-ups are OK. Some of them love their job some just want the check and its very clear.
good,"loved working there, I met some great people. I had to leave because it was too far from my home and school started getting in the way. if I had the chance and was in a better spot I would go back. I am pursuing my career now."
good,"Lavoro su tre turni,di cui il notturno non è obbligatorio,possibilità di crescita professionale,corsi gratuiti di inglese,Excel"
good,"I loved working at Amazon! That particular job taught me to be effeciant at a rapid speed. It does get a bit tiring at times, but I would highly recommend working there."
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. Work environment is fantastic and they provide you with a ton of resources to help with just life in general.  4 day work weeks.
good,Best thing about the place is the people. They hire alot of people but they leave fairly quick because how stressful it was. I because of death in the family. Amazon told me that I have to wait a full year to get rehired. I don't understand that since I give them the death certificate so I should of been brought back with ease. Only really issue I have is one of the manager was having a relationship with one of the female co-worker and nothing was done about it. She got to do what she want and quinn the site manager in st. pete allowed it. I enjoyed working the dtp1 location.
good,Its just a quick pace job and you have to be able to operate machinery and they rate you at the end of the week and the rate is 100%.i have nothing else to comment on
good,I’m only 20 but the ages are really diverse. Overall good job . Doing the same thing constantly does get quite draining after a while but if you don’t like many changes this would be a nice job
good,"Its the most unbelievable business....dynamic, open, fast paced, full of wicked smart people.   Its a privilege to work there.  The flip side.... absolutely relentless pace and unforgiving pressure for results. But people are well rewarded, and thats the trade off.  Awesome place to work."
good,There was a day when every employee had to stow 450 items/per hour. It was a very typical day at my work and I have learned to be patience. And focused on stowing the items. Hard part was to work fast paced environment. Enjoyable part was achieving the goal of this job.
good,"Loved working here. They usually only hire positive, fun people so it  is rare to have a ""bad cookie"" co-worker. I definitely enjoyed working here as a seasonal associate, and would love the opportunity to continue my part-time employment here in the future."
good,"I will recommend Amazon to all my friends and relatives to work. It is a wonderful place to work, and the benefits are just supper cool. You also have the opportunity to enroll in the career program at Amazon for a better working experience and career."
good,I have been working for Amazon since June 2016 and absolutely love my job. Lots of potential for career advancement. Working 10 hours a day constantly on your feet is the con. Pro is we work 4 days with 3 days off.
good,"The year I experienced at Amazon has been a pretty amazing year to say the least.  I started off as inventory control for ten months which was a very easy position.  The position required counting product within the warehouse to make sure it matches up with the system.  There are three different types of counts to learn and I was able to excel at all three thanks to managements willingness to openly train us into more advanced roles.  The management has always been very nice and relaxed, especially on our night shift crew.  We are always encouraged to do our best and there's incentives to do so as well such as gift cards during peak season, and power hours that can sometimes earn you a extra fifteen minute break.  One struggle though is the boredom that comes with it, it can be very challenging to stand in one spot for 12 hours and do the same thing over and over but in the end even that isn't so bad."
good,Free to be who you are. Worked hard and played hard. Work is physically demanding but rewarding. Loved working outside all day. Management is honest and direct.
good,"I find good working environment and good canteen ."
good,learned how to handled the customers.workplace and culture are the most interesting parts.we can enjoy the day while working.IJPs are the most interesting part
good,"The job I was assigned was great and easy to do and allowed for time to spare. The break room is great, good amenities, employee lockers and good security."
good,"good place to work, not much laboral development in the company"
good,"As soon as you start the shift they have a beginning shift meeting that basically lays out the day. You start off with mandatory stretching to help prevent job related injuries. You are then sent to start your shift and work 2.5hr straight before a mandatory 15min break. Your work can be monotonous, but you are allotted breaks and a lunch to break it up. The work environment is faced paced but still a little more laxed. It is an enjoyable company that offers great incentives and a great pay rate."
good,"Job was fun. Work with people from all backgrounds. Great benefits. Pay could be a little better, if your a single income wouldn't be enough to live off of. If music was allowed would make time go by a lot faster. Opportunity for advancement is very competitive. Overall great company to work for."
good,Great work environment with engaging management that cares about you and your work / life balance. You are expected to know a lot about Amazon's products and services but they're easy to learn and pretty self explanatory.
good,"Great place to move ahead as a manager if you are looking to take on more responsibilities. Enthusiasm, good work ethic, and leadership are greatly appreciated here."
good,"Amazon is a wonderful employer, and I really enjoy that I get to work from home. I'm very thankful for the opportunity to work for them and the fact that I get a discount is awesome."
good,Amazon is a great place to work for! The management and team mates are great and make work fun. Hardest part for me has been the constant change in the schedule and the hours that I have to work. Other than that I love working for Amazon
good,Stow is the best department to work in 100 percent daily rate which is very easy to maintain if your working its chill just mainly pay attention to what your doing and try not to create any quality errors if your good on that ah man it’s a piece of cake
good,"Cool place to work at and there really isnt a dress code, no uniform. They even let you change departments or roles if you get tired of doing the samw thing everyday."
good,The Delivery Station Manager is a role that requires me to be adaptable to fast-paced environments and possess an ability to react quickly and professionally to change.
good,"Bonne entreprise, quotat facile à réaliser. Café gratuit, musique variée."
good,Amazon was a overall good experience I enjoyed my time there. If I wasn’t going off for school I definitely would have stayed at amazon and made it a career
good,"Good place to work, warm atmosphere. They are a good company that pays well. The canteens are clean....................................................."
good,"flexible hours, fast paced training, not many breaks, good pay, voluntary time off, shift bids, involved management, paid training, supplied equipment"
good,Great place to work. The pay and benefits are excellent and start on day 1 of employment. The work is very physical. you are on your feet and up and down stairs/ladders for the entire shift excluding breaks and lunch.
good,"Hi,"
good,"I enjoyed working here, long hours, and ok money. Fast past job so you'll always have something to do never boring as long as you keep busy time fly's."
good,"Just feel blessed to be a part of the team, it’s more of just being there and enjoying your tasks, I feel awesome!!! When you are away from being just a number and treated with importance, provided with information about where you should improve, how you could shape up your career each scheduled day, it’s great motivation and one feels just amazing..... like I do.... KUDOS"
good,Great part time job for anyone needing a flexible schedule. Typical day you come in and they will have u scheduled to work in a area but will move you if needed.
good,I wish I never stopped working there. Amazon was a great place to work at and I would recommend it for anyone to work there. They work with people who have disabilities too.
good,"Great benefits, great pay, great for part time. I started for peak season for a few extra bucks. It is a start up company so we worked in a big tent however did everything they could to make you feel comfortable. Security was non existence , on hot nights they leave doors open, exposed to anyone just freely to walk in. They listen to problems and work to make things better. I personally left because hours wasn't paying bills. Great for part time work. I would definitely come back and work with them again!"
good,Depends on the person and the outcome of the situations and the team work and the drive to want more out of life and never give up and keep pushing for a understanding of results.
good,Intense yet rewarding. You learn a lot working at Amazon. Things change constantly so you are expected to adapt. Lots of room to grow since the company is expanding the world over.
good,"•	Share results of audits on a weekly/daily basis. Reporting of key insight trends, using statistical rigor to simplify and inform the larger team of noteworthy story lines."
good,"Empowered work culture. Immense opportunities for career growth if your performance is extraordinary. "
good,"whish i didnt get hurt ,I would of been there for a long time.the benifits are great and you can talk to the managers when you need to ,they train you on all jobs.you also can change postions and move up within the comany"
good,"working at amazon was great with good pay. i worked as a picker/packer. i pulled and picked orders, after i packed the order, i put the boxes on the conveyor to be checked and shipped."
good,I learned so much about computer systems and what all it takes into working for a multi company when it comes to selling products or putting them into the system for purchase. The environment was quick-paced and very loud sometimes but the energy was very uplifting sometimes. The hardest part of the job would be during prime season when you only had one day off it would be difficult to keep up your normal pace and standards on your position. The best part of the job was most of the coworkers as well as supervisors were very encouraging and helpful
good,"Bonne entreprise , "
good,Amazon was a great and clean environment all managers knew exactly what they were doing they were on the ball with communication to explaining tasks.Something they cannot stress enough of what safety and quality they always want to make sure the people were safe no matter what second came the quality of the product that people were ordering however Amazon had great training and great motivation.
good,"Hay muy buen ambiente de trabajo, quizas la parte mas dificil es el ritmo de trabajo, pero en todo momento se promueve el "" preguntame"" por lo tanto se aseguran de que aprendas de la mejor forma posible cualquier proceso. En cuanto a la seguridad del trabajor son muy extrictos."

good,"Amazon is a great company to work for with its diverse culture and salary benefits."
good,"Working at Amazon books was a great experience, I learned a lot about the most trending books. How, the online system works, how to use the newest technology as well. It also helped me become a better associate in order to help customers. During the holidays was hectic but also taught me how to work in a fast paced environment. I did like all of my co-workers, everyone was friendly and helped me everytime I had a question about anything. The hardest part about the job was trying to learn details about the technology and explaining it to customers who just had a ton of questions. ""How much storage does it have and what is the camera capability?"" etc etc. Also the hardest part was when customers asked questions on a book I never read or when all the books I recommended were being denied as an option! But overall you learn the different tastes for books of all ages and gives you a better understanding of what others might want to read."
good,"Fast paste, workout and earn $$$$ At the same time. You will learn and have the knowledge on how to work in a warehouse. There are plenty of opportunities to achieve to higher position."

good,The people at Amazon are so nice! They really try to make you feel at home. They train you really well and always make you feel heard. They have so many different schedules to choose from. Lots of new job opportunities.
good,The hardest part about the job is just being energetic for several hours. Being able to work 5 plus hrs on top of your regular work shift. its stressful.
good,Sometime they have slow days like around the beginning of the year. For about 3 months. They have vto and vet. Vto is voluntary time off vet is voluntary extra time. They have three day shift for 12 hours and 4 day shift for 10 hours your extra day will be for 10 order your extra day can be for 12 hours in which you'll be working 5 days for 10 hours or it could be 12 hours for 4 days start off pay with Amazon is $15 an hour you get two breaks when you work the 10 hour shift you get three breaks when you work the 12 hour shift the 10-hour shift is from Sunday the way and see the 12-hour shifts from Thursday to saturday
good,Ho lavorato per amazon soltanto per poco.Spero di essere richiamato perche' mi sono trovato benissimo.
good,Typical work day is fast paced packing. Learned to pack use different warehouse equipment. Management was really approachable. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people.

good,I loved the diversity and the fact that the managers helped out on the floor. It is a very physically demanding job. I compared it to being at the gym for four to five hours daily.
good,Good place to work. Must be able to work long hours. Holidays they give out a lot of overtime and incentives for those that don't take off during the holidays!
good,"Had a very good manager, he cared about your safety. Great group of people to work with. Never a boring day. Good pay. Fun competitions during peak time."
good,I absolutely love my job at amazon.  I am a sort associate at a distribution facility.  I get paid well with benefits to put bags on carts and wheel them up front.  My only gripe is that I wish I had more hours and there was a clear path for promotion.
good,A day a work is like everyday warm up get started and work you talk and laugh while working environment is lay'd back. It is repetitive if you allow it ask to learn something new and try something else.

good,"Je travaille chez Amazon depuis mai tenant deux mois pour les fêtes de fin d'année et je trouve que c'est un bon travail. De l'extérieur Amazon a une super mauvaise réputation, avant de rentrer j'ai entendu tellement de mal de cette entreprise que j'avais l'impression de me diriger vers l'enfer.

good,"Great place for advancement and career opportunities! Amazon is a safe and productive environment where promotion is encouraged. Pay is acceptable, and quick promotions enable you to make what you need!"

good,I enjoyed working at Amazaon as picker for two months. The downside to it is they expect a person to be able to get 1000 a items a shift every night can be stressful on the body.
good,"Kept you busy but shifts were limited to 6 1/2 hours, 4 days a week w/ 3 days off. PTO was convenient and easy to obtain with little to no overhead. You just needed to put in the request and it was automatically accepted. "
good,"Cool environment, good location, flexible hours. Would recommend Amazon Dispatch to anyone looking for a second job. Changes occur often but it's easy to adapt."
good,"A pretty fair job, great people, fair management, definitely a great place to work if you're starting out or even if you need extra money. Amazon also has a very flexible schedule"
good,"Most of the work at the Amazon Sortation Center is very physical so if your looking to get in shape you can do it at an Amazon Sortation Center. It's like getting paid for going to the gym only more satisfying, you're doing something constructive."
good,"Learned:"
good,amazon was a very convenient place to work. however the compensation and hours could be a little better. I also feel that the opportunity to move up is slim to none.
good,"Proud to be an Amazon Employee with all good facilities, a lot of support from the respective manager or leaders."
good,Work is work and pay is better than any job i ever had. This is a good job to work if you are in high school or college. Hardest part was when i worked for stow. ICQA is the best love it.

good,I have worked happy and every time the is new thing to lear. and had  few managers  hat makes the work easy and and convenient for all the workers or employees.
good,"This job is great. Lots of opportunities to move up. Lots of benefits. This job is NOT for lazy people. Lots of people that complain about the job are lazy and expect to get paid to do nothing. It's a job. You're supposed to do work. If you can't handle a very physical job, then this job isn't for you."
good,Amazon Associates is a nice place to work and they make the job easier with how the system functions and how easy it is to obtain certain links for certain products.
good,"Before you start your shift all employees are required to stretch together as a group, so muscles are pulled from the walking as a picker. they had vending machines that gave you items you might need for the job you are doing , such as ear plugs gloves googles. During the actual shift you were required to make a curtain amount of items picked from the shelves. You were promised to go your own speed, so being over worked was not an issue. Management was nice enough to provide you with anything you needed for your job, such as soles for your shoes. Because our job was taxing on our feet, they provided foot support for your shoes. Which was nice because some people couldn't afford new shoes. With that said the most hardest part i thought of the job was, trying to make it from one end of the warehouse to the next before your 15mins were up. We were given two 15min, breaks, that were payed. Then a 30min, break that was not paid. Because the warehouse is so big, sometimes i spent my 15 min working. The benefits of working at amazon was pretty amazing. If you out picked everyone at the end of the month, you had a chance to win a flat screen or some other prize. like money."
good,My day is picking items for shipment and making sure boxes does not smash when stacking. Music is playing when you arrive and everyone is friendly . Staying in one spot all day was hard to get used to but it’s getting better
good,"My experience was very good with Amazon."
good,Fun and fast paced. If you like working in a high productive area with friendly people then this is the job for you. The management is very hands on and willing to help and all of the coworkers are very friendly
good,"Great company to work for. Staff and other team members were very helpful with assisting new hires. Most of the phone was repeative, which made the work day pretty easy."
good,"I did pick orders on the floor and in the air with an OP or forklift. It was a good job, fast-paced, and always busy. If downtime occurred, I would be summoned to the dock area to help load 6 or 7 trucks at the same time. It was challenging but the time went by fast and you definitely lose weight if you're doing lots of walking."
good,"I held a temporary position at the RIC2 in Virginia for a holiday season, however due to car and shoulder trouble i moved on to other endeavors once the term had ended. I moved to North Carolina, and quite frankly cant wait for a factory to be built near me. Great source of temp work for those that need a little extra cash, or just want to get their foot in the door somewhere. Highly recommend working for amazon in packing department."
good,"This was a great place to work. The entire floor of people, the managers, resolution specialists all felt at the same level.It was a great experience and had to leave due to family."
good,"Amazon Is a good company to work for. Everything quick and fast and you must be able to keep up. Management was not on point, you basically had to train yourself and learn how to work with using robot.s"
good,Great people and environment to work in.They have a great no tolerance rule to fighting which I loved.Diversified community and all excepted.Great PAY FOR PART TIME EMPLOYMENT!
good,"Working there was extremely fun. Enjoyed working with everyone on my team and a few friends I knew before also work there. I wish I didn't leave, could easily say I regret leaving. Well it's in the past and I can't change it. I'm still on good terms with them and enjoyed every second working there."

good,A typical day at work is normal to me and is a Very nice environment and the workplace culture is health. The management come to interact and ask question
good,"If you want a career not just a job with the chance to grow than I would suggest here. For the time I was there I pick orders, package them, bring packers boxes, transport pallets of boxes, and some other jobs. There was nothing there that I would call difficult. Management was management they can be a bit pushy and even if you work hard if your numbers are not up to their liking they will let you go. Co-workers are the same everywhere you go. You got your good people then you got your personalities. Most enjoyable thing was three days of rest. That is if you're not working Christmas season. During the holiday times if very possible that you might only get one day off or none."
good,This is a great company and the studio environment was inclusive. I enjoyed the contract position as it allowed me to learn about the culture and become one with the employee engagement initiatives created by my team. I could appreciate managements and H.R.'s efforts to increase work life balance and allow every employee to dive deep and explore their ideas. Truly interesting concepts and loved their leadership principles. A great guide for any companies mission to improve the employee base.
good,"I liked working for Amazon because my coworkers were very nice,friendly and fun to work with.The supervisors are very helpful and professional.It was fast paced and the day went by quick."
good,Some of the management have  no people skills and are clueless but overall it is a great place to work and they have excellent benefits available from the 1st day of work. There is nothing hard about any job in the warehouse but it is very fast paced and goal oriented.
good,Moviated succeed to meet your quota. The shift is very long and you are constantly in pain but you have to stretch to get relief.The work culture is vey good .
good,Good place to work for a few hours each day. Management is enjoyable. You get 20 hrs a week but can get more hours through the week if offered. A good place to work.
good,"nothing to review, they're great."
good,Good place to work for people with very long term career aspiration. If you are some one who has a plan in place for your career then you will be disappointed.
good,My current job lets me work with people and build relationships.  I love pointing people in the right direction and where they need to go.  At the end of the day I feel satisfied.
good,"rood security sometimes,doctors not realy friendly,lazy employes arguing againts hardworking people,menagment very friendly,like them...i was happy there as i worked very hard"
good,"I loved my job at Amazon,  I loved the benefits they offerd. I loved the time off they offered. The fast paced work environment, it was just my style.  If I could go back sooner I would."
good,"I have been working for Amazon for more than two years now!  If you can secure a spot in the Customer Service Reserves branch you will have a lot of flexibility to maintain your work and, school scheduling.  I highly recommend working for Amazon and, I truly appreciate what I do.  Customers are generally friendly and, out of the thousands of calls I have probably made I rarely get an irate customer.  What motivates me most is being able to make an impact on people's lives.  I especially enjoy making the customer's day and, leaving the call knowing that they have a friend they can rely on.  The customer reviews motivate me the most in this position!"
good,quick paced and Highly paced work environment that provides a more then adequate salary and benefits package for all of its current employees regardless of their position.
good,"There is a great deal of stress over the need for teamwork within the Amazon warehouse. Each person's task relies upon the task of another person being done with quality, efficiency, and safety.  Job training and guidance was critical, and capable persons were always able to work with each other to offer input and experience as well as management input on completion of work as a learning environment.  Each shift would begin with a short meeting on goals, achievements, safety spotlight areas, and input from the staff.  The most successful workers seemed to be the ones who worked steady and safe, but mindful of a target goal within a set time period.  While challenging at first, the Amazon workday could become somewhat routine as shipping and receiving similar products from shippers was often predictable, but it was always good to be accurate.  Meeting goals was simple if you keep in mind what your role is and follow your training path toward meeting it."
good,"I enjoyed my time as a picker, i found it easy to understand and enoyed being paid to keep fit.  I liked that the breaks weren't very long as people didn't sit around wasting time making the day longer, i find time goes fast whhen i'm picking."
good,I had my start here and I would recommend to those looking to start their careers. The team looks for character and those who are willing to learn new tasks.
good,"The employee benefits excellent in Amazon. As an employee in Amazon, the company is very nice. All the employees are very helpful. It's fast wornking enviornment. I love it."
good,A very good company to work at with an awesome work culture. Amazon is not just the world's most customer centric company but also a very employee caring company.
good,That is the motto at Amazon.com. Excellent work environment with hard working peers who try to have fun whenever they find time. I have worked with multiple teams in both voice and non-voice channels and learned a great deal about customers all over the world. My primary department was for US followed by Canada and Australia.
good,"I liked the fast pace work experience, always have something to do constantly in motion, which makde it alot easier to stay awake until 5 in the morning."
good,"It is physical hard work, but you feel a since of accomplishment when dead lines are met. We were processing 200,000 packages a"
good,"It a fun place to work at the peers are very supportive, u can walk up to them when ever u need. Also, the management is pretty impressive."
good,"Great job to work from home assisting delivery drivers with directions and customers with trackinv their packages as well as refunds & returns Good pay, easy training and laptop provided, employee provided internet"
good,"Very fast pace, hectic and fun. The job is what it is and once you accept the fact everything is fine. Not many people in Ct make enough by the hour at their job. That being said Amazon pays better than other retailers."
good,"I loved working at Amazon only issue I had was standing all those hours but once you get used to it, it's a breeze. Benefits are amazing and start the first day of your orientation. I would say the job is fairly easy once you get into the routine of doing it. I would recommend working at Amazon to anyone, the job is great!"
good,azienda sana purtroppo il mio contratto e durato poco spero essere richiamato
good,"At times, this job can be stressful, even tedious, the work can be demanding, and the warehouse can be loud... in the extreme... or quiet as a church. It can be cold or extremely warm, as well. But the pay is good, the benefits are great, and there are plenty of perks to keep people motivated."
good,10 hours working day is easy and not booring i learn there how to live with people from other culture managment is great culture of people who worging with me is good hardest for me is survive last hour in job like all i like 30min break witch good fod from the cantein
good,"can complain nothin great nothing special its just work thats all either you show up or you dont show up nothing more nothing less, managers are cool ."
good,"Its fun to work at Amazon if you are desired to grow its little tough "
good,I have learned a lot at Amazon. They are good at advancement if that is what you want to do  the benefits are good. I didn’t like the ten hour shifts much.
good,"I liked working at Amazon. It was very laid back. We had a nap room, game/tv room, and lots of comfy chairs and sofas to relax on during breaks. The management and co-workers were all super happy and joyful. Everybody generally got along and we were very interactive."
good,"Everyone knows before walking in the doors that Amazon is fast paced work week.  The job is what you make of it, you can make friends, be involved or keep your head down and get on with it. There are many opportunities for a person to do what he/she wants within the employment.....lots of room for growth, transfer within or relocate.  "
good,"It's a nice company to work for but there's some lack of management.  They treat their employees very well every other month with cookouts, family fun, activities every month. Peak season.....well there's longgg hours but at the end it pays off."
good,"Amazon really is a wonderful place to work at. This is because the pay is great and once you become permanent you get all kinds of benefits.  "
good,Amazon is a fun place to work me people.to always meet and.is fair but management does not function well. Hear climate sometimes was bad and there was times when I really didn't like the management how they made plans to get product out or assign work places for staff
good,"your start your day with  a good exercises and pep talks. everybody feels their efforts will matter, and that they aren't merely robots sifting through a lengthy task list.."
good,It was fast paced and hard for me to handle the long hours at first. Pretty easy after you get into it. I was a packer. Lunches and breaks are quick and work is even quicker!
good,Amazon provided Flexible hours with their part time work from home positions. Amazon allowed me to pick my own hours day or night. I was able to learn a lot of the Amazon business through their training program.
good,"Hard work but fun with competitive co-workers, the management team are supportive and great, I learned a lot of organizational skills, the hardest part of the job would be their competitions they would have for an hour."
good,I would do it again if it could cover my living expenses. I enjoyed working from home. The were always team building activities that allowed us to learn about each other so that we could work better together.
good,I just got tired of the long hours and wanted to just do something new like cook clean up you know I just got really tired of the job but I will go back if I had to but other than that it was a pretty alright job.
good,There was times where we would chant and yell during stand up like a actual team very competitive in a good way everyone got involved and sometimes there was prizes all in all just a awesome environment
good,this place is fun to work at but when it come to breaks depending on where you station is you get to enjoy little of your break. with lunch you only got a half hour lunch with a 12 hour shift
good,"Expected to be hustling the entire shift, on your feet the whole time.Use a handheld scanner to direct you where to go next. It is messy and dusty and lots of other people working, but you are on your own. There are scheduled raises every 6 months. There are opportunities to learn other positions. There are contests and give aways during the pre holiday season, and mandatory overtime then too."
good,it was a fast paces job sorting boxes to different shipping locations and then sorting with scanners for sub location. all in all it was a good team building job and everyone works well together.
good,I enjoyed the people I interacted with.  The managers was great to work with always motivating you to do your best. The job in itself was mundane. I learned how to drive a cherry picker. The workplace cultured was diverse. I like that.
good,"I was hired at the warehouse and was  paid very well for my area. The hardest part of this job was the hours during holidays. I was a seasonal employee so they let me go after Christmas but I enjoyed every minuet of working there. One thing they get you on is benefits, they are very particular on how and when you get these. Other than that my only issue was if their machines stalled, which they did ALOT, they counted it against you. I assume it was to keep you constantly worried about being fired, making you work faster."
good,"As long as you’re focus, working, and being productive you will have no issues. Be prepared to do team lifts for up to 100 lbs. and up to 50lbs on your own."
good,"I have truly enjoyed working for the Amazon company, they have always been fair and good to me. accommodating to my needs and keeping the work environment safe fore all their employees"
good,It is a great to work for this great Company. Work schedule is flexible and everyone is supplied with laptop computer and able to telecommute. employees are allowed to bring their dog and many people like about this opportunity.  you can work at home or your office and could have a tele conference among your coworkers
good,"head to the lines, grabbed boxes coming down the isle, grabbed your specific boxes with the numbers you were responsible for to take off and place on the right racks for their destination, then after the boxes get put in the correct destination bags from the racks, we would zip them up and place them on carts to take to the corret delivery trucks."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, "
good,"Great culture, can do attitude to everything, love working here. The management is supportive and encouraging. The office is pleasant and co-workers are genuinely supportive"
good,"Every day is a day one at Amazon. Challenging workplace with scope to learn new skills in every quarter."
good,"Amazon has been able to maintain this scrappy mentality after growing into one of the largest companies in the world. They pride themselves on a set of leadership principles, which they constantly leverage in communication to push the company forward as an innovative force."
good,"I truly enjoyed by time at Amazon, very flexible hours and designed to compete against yourself by measuring personal productivity.  I always strived to beat my personal production goals.  Excellent company to work for"
good,"Working at amazon prime was amazing and I would recommend working there to friends, but I had to leave because I wasn't getting enough hours there. The employees and management there are super friendly and enjoyable to work with I wish I would of been able to stay there, but due to lack of hour they were able to offer I wasn't able to make the lack of hours work."
good,"I currently work at the Farmers Branch location. It is not air controlled, if I had known that I would have applied for a different location. They will flex you up an hour on the weekends on my shift because of so many absences."
good,This is the place to be if one wants to challenge self and others everyday to work backwards from the Customer pain point and deliver cutting edge tech products to solve a problem statement
good,"Amazon, was a great job.  I was trained in almost every position in inbound with excellence and retained many skills that I can carry forward into my next job opportunity.  Its fast paced; which I enjoy, and the management did really well running the company, however there were times I feel they did not put their associates personal lives into consideration.  The hardest part of the job was all of the mandatory overtime, but the paychecks made up for it.  I loved the people I worked with, and enjoyed learning new things on a daily basis"
good,"Can be hard honest work, but tends to be a good environment with some opportunity to move up in the company.  A good company overall to work for and I would recommend it to others."
good,I enjoyed working at amazon because of the people you meet at your buildings. There’s such a diverse culture of people from all over the world under one roof. I love hearing different associates backgrounds and stories they have to share.
good,"Very interesting and exciting environment with a diverse group of people and projects. "
good,Very structured and process driven.  Valuable learning experiences through the teachings of many classes involving process improvements for the customer.  Customer is extremely important.
good,"m not gonna lie, working in Amazon warehouse is fast pace environment. Four Days a week for 10hrs. The working varmint is very learn as you go. Nothing is going to be explained thoroughly so you have to pick up on it quickly or think of creative ways to get the work done."
good,"Good place to work in picktime, I've worked a few months there and it's pretty good. The targets are good, but you have to work. They have free coffee,juices. A very clean place to work. But they could also improve."
good,"I really do think that Amazon is a wonderful place to work "
good,"We would start in groups and stretch before our shifts, you get breaks and lunch. You walk alot. The employees and supervisors are nice and always helpful."
good,"it was a nice job but i only worked there pert-time, the job was temporary. I only worked there a few weeks so i can not really give a good review. sorry"
good,All the workers they nice to talk get a long they team work. Alot overtime OK paid . I go in night shift I did want stay there more longer be a good worker.
good,"I was a contract hire supporting a media team at Amazon for 3 months. The pace of work was quick paced, as is expected at Amazon, but my team also maintained a fantastic work/life balance and was fantastic to work with,"
good,"Good place to work.  Managers are good to work with. They listen to the employees. It's fast paced, but they do a lot for the employees.  Food events, picnics, swag."
good,Data driven culture where everyone is empowered to innovate and drive the direction of the company. You will work with some of the best in the industry (high bar for entry) and you will have the opportunity to drive as much of the business direction as interests you.
good,"It was a good, fast-paced job that provided great benefits. My only complaint was working weekends. Must be willing to stand for long periods of time."
good,Vest job to go to if you can stay on your feet for long periods of time. The job is straight forward and the break room is great to relax. Staying active prevents you from getting cold.
good,"Enjoyable but fast-paced environment. at times, works assignments can be physically draining particularily during Peak Season. Management is extremely helpful and willing to assist you in regards to your job assignment for that particular day."
good,"Amazon is definitely very demanding, but if you expect that going into it, it's a fantastic placed to work. Great training and development, the best benefits of anywhere I've worked, and very competitive compensation."
good,"Amazon is a fun place to work, they always recognize the hard work their employees do and give incentives and rewards for a job well done. they really make you feel welcome and like you're really part of a team."
good,"No two days are ever alike. One day you will have resources to help guide you on what to do to solve an issue, and on other days you will be the first and only person in the company to see the type of issue being brought to you and expected to resolve it by an estimated given amount of time. Some times you will have management available but plan to represent the department as there will normally be no time to meet with IT management and instead you are expected to provide an answer for all questions and follow up on those issues to keep the customer updated on the current status of the issue."
good,"This is a Fast paced, cool work environment. Down to earth people. The only negative i have is that i rarely see fulltime available. Aside from that , I have no complaints about this job."
good,"It gives good part time job to students  and give a good salary to people who are attached with the compney . "

good,"Fun filled atmosphere filled with goal oriented people who are of the same mindset when it comes to product, love of amazon and motivation for the next great release or career opportunity."
good,depending if you like to work long hours for a short period of time or ten a hours a day for less days of work however part time is available with better options
good,Amazon was an awesome place to work for the 3 months I was there. We built an excellent community and the work was easy to learn and do. Only complaint is the pace at which you work at and must increase. This hinders the accuracy of performing the required job.
good,"Shippers and receivers will need to know:"
good,they would start off with stretches to keep pulled muscles to a minimum. they would teach us what we eeded to do and give us a week to get used to it before we had to meet our quota for the day. the management team would work with you if needed. there were people from different cultures working and getting along. the hardest part for me was the rate due to an old injury. the most enjoyale part was the people i worked with and seeing what all people ordered.
good,Everything what involved amazon was an amazing experience staff was amazing they helped me evertime I needed explain me how to do my job properly and how can I improve mi kpi I can't say nothing bad about this company one of the best working place ever had

good,Working for Amazon is hard but definitely worth it. Production requirements are reasonable not back breaking. Management is friendly though sometimes communication is lacking.

good,"A great place to work, specially the work culture is awesome . I had to leave AMAZON for my further studies . but I wish to go back to the same company If I ever get opportunity"

good,"Very flexible work schedules for full time students. enjoyable place to work, friendly staff, and helpful associates. team environment, and safe place to work."
good,Hard work at times but definitely not a bad place to work if you live close. As part time you get 4 hour shifts for at max 6 days a week. I’m looking for a little more than that but if you only need part time and a good work out this is the job
good,To work for this company you need to sign a non disclosure agreement. I do not feel comfortable discussing anything about the job or position. It is a
good,Good place with good working hours and handsome salary but the only con is that they can fire you at anytime if you are a pert time employee.Rest all is awesome.

good,"Most of the work paths are pretty slow and boring. There are plenty of opportunities for advancements, and a lot of resources to help you make the advancements. Once you promote to a PA or higher, the pace begins to pick up."
good,"Be willing to learn, show up for work and on time, you are rewarded monthly by doing your job.  Lazy individuals, do not apply.  Excellent benefit you won't find anywhere else.

good,"Amazon intern has been an eye opener to me. My mentor was smart, kind and professional. I was fairly compensated and well treated. A good place for internship."
good,"An excellent part time job! The benefits are exceptional and management is supurb! This is a part time job so the hours are minimal, yet the opportunity to pick up additional shifts are often available."
good,Its a very fast paced work environment they offer good insurance and help paying for education. During peak season there is plenty room for overtime. I hated loosing my job due to lack of work. The staff is very friendly and helpful the hpurs are good.
good,"Working at Amazon was very easy and fun at the same time. I dealt with packages, loaded the trucks, scanned and placed the packages in the correct location, and after 4-5 hours each day, I went home. The job wasn't that hard at all. It was very easy."
good,"10 min stretches while doing safety meeting, log into Rf scanner, and either stock arriving merchandise or do do small side jobs. I learned to work Rf scanner. Managment was cool was always there to help you find your way around to learn the stations. The hardest part of the job is getting hours. Your day goes by Pretty fast"
good,I loved my job...losing it was devastating. I loved everything about Amazon. I was able to cross train in several
good,"La mia esperienza in Amazon anche se breve per quello che mi riguarda è stata fantastica! Ambiente ottimale, dinamico e colleghi e manager cortesi ed educati, sicurezza al TOP. Se avessi la fortuna di ritornarci avrei molto piacere di mettere radici e non muovermi più. P.S. Amazon il miglior lavoro che ho mai svolto"
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. They really believe in compensating their workers for every hour spent working or traveling for the purpose of working.
good,"If you work for Amazon.com, you are considered to be at the top of your field. Expectations are high, the hours are long, but it is totally worth it!!"
good,Depends on your manager wish he is good you will have unstoppable growth.the opreations MBA is the best way to grow in amazon and they have an encouraging environment
good,work was easy fun as long as you stay on task management was decent but some showed favorites at time. the work was not hard actually kind of fun if you are a competitive person.
good,"Amazon is a very relaxed work environment. Arrive in your pj's for all they care, just be ready to work and give excellent customer service. The health benefits, pay rate, leadership coaching, and expectations were easily the best of the places I've worked thus far in my life. I won't say it was perfect, or sunshine and rainbows all the time. Like any office setting there are moments of nepotism, and I've heard of other managers/team leads not being as on it as mine were. But overall I loved my time there,and the teams I worked with (and the Xbox PS4 rooms)."
good,Amazon is competitive and they have high expectations for everyone involved with the company. People willing to work hard will be rewarded. Very diverse workforce!
good,"At Amazon you can truly leap!  You are encouraged to THINK BIG, LEARN & BE CURIOUS, grow, exercise BIAS FOR ACTION and have real OWNERSHIP in work that is 'mission critical' and genuinely 'making history'."
good,Faced paced but safe and comfortable work environment.Lots of opportunity for training; and growth if you are available to relocate. Work pace especially hard during peak seasons (Nov. to Jan.)
good,"There is a lot to learn and a lot to do. Interesting work in a variety of areas and ample opportunity to pick up new skills. Also, plenty of coffee, and snacks!"
good,Everyone at Amazon knows what is demanded of them and usually exceeds those expectations. Management is really on top of their game when it comes to creating a fun and safe work environment for everyone from all walks of life.
good,E un ambiente perfetto per chi vole solo andare a lavorare senza ke ti rompibo le palle
good,"It was an easy going environment, I had some skills needed for the job, yet there were many more that I don't have;however my coworkers helped me and guided me to make it easier for me to work there"
good,"I didn't have an interview to my knowledge, there was a lengthy application process and after about a month I received an offer contingent upon a background check. I worked in the SDS, primarily with drivers and recently switched to drivers & customers. Training goes by quickly and your first calls always make you nervous because you feel like you know nothing. Amazon offers many internal resources when you encounter a problem."
good,"in amazon i feel still day 1, every day is more energetic."
good,a typical day at amazon can be different depending what department you work at. I learned and how to receive boxes to insure the customers is getting what they ordered. The hardest part of the job is probably being on your feet all day.
good,"Great management team! Management team was honest, fair and supportive. Learned a great deal about the eCommerce business, package handling, and production."
good,"I enjoyed working there. A lot of people say its tough but its a warehouse. You do need to make your quota. I always said as long as you show up and work, you will have no problem.  The days do get tough sometimes but that's everywhere. The base pay isn't probably the greatest but if you take into consideration the bonus you can earn individually and as a building and the stocks they give you every year and the benefit package and time off etc etc. The list goes on. I would highly recommend Amazon as a great place to work and get your foot into many different tasks/roles."
good,Amazon is a wonderful company to work for. With solving the customer issues by making sure no financial fraud happens and making Amazon the most trustworthy and safest place to shop online on the earth.
good,"n/a"
good,Productive fast pacing job. During holidays offer employees nice electronics such has tablets and cameras. During holidays management  will bring food for thanksgiving and Christmas to feed everyone.
good,"Eine gute Firma ,habe gerne da gearbeitet es wird Familie gesagt meine Frau War mit mir zusammen da"
good,I have only worked there for about 3 months but I have not been disappointed in any way other than the hours i have worked. Their managing is supportive and understanding their work ethic is constructive their energy is sustainable and always trying to improve.
good,Can fixed your schedule and people work as team. Can be safely if you follow the rule and job can be successful. It is between easy and hard job. I like people I work with.
good,Everyone seemed to get along and help each other out here. I was here briefly but the time spent here was happy. Would highly recommend to anyone as a good place to work.
good,This job is a great entry level job! It’s funniversll as Amazon is the easiest website to help customers navigate. Basically you’re issuing refunds for Guest or helping them find items to put in their cart.
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and customer driven. Very good benefits. Optional advancement at times. Hardest part is not being able to sit. Overall amazing company and team to be a part of.
good,"I really enjoy working for them, you can earn a reasonable income from it and choose when want to work. "
good,Pretty steady to fast paced at times. Peak season (Holidays) brings on ALOT of hours. From October to January you can usually expect 5 - 6 days of mandatory 12 hour shifts. A lot of opportunity for advancement and cross training in other departments. I highly recommend being cross trained in as many departments as possible.
good,i enjoy working at amazon and think the fast pace  environment is  great there are certain things that could be improved but overall it is has been a great experience the only negative i can give is not knowing when your time is up  as you are hired through a agency it can end at any time which isn't ideal for somebody with a young family but as long as you work hard and are punctual  you would hope to be kept  which i have  there are great benefits once you get a blue badge and they are rely good with helping there associates excel
good,"Even though I am very physically fit, I find myself beat after each shift.  It's like going to the gym every day,  It's not for everyone, but you won't find a better company or a better paying part-time job.  But you will work hard."
good,Nice place to work and great people you work with. Management is nice and understanding. Kinda sucks that the work place is somewhat far away from where I lived.
good,I had a good experience @ Amazon.   The high pace. Working by yourself until it's time to go home.  Management was not the best when you need direction. I think because of the constant changes.
good,"its a newly open buinding when i started there. Its a fast paced job, hours of my shift is tiring. 12 hours. Coworkers and some management staff are good. Cool place to work."
good,typical day at work is 10 or 12 hour shifts of packing and slam at pack. I learned how to use a pallet jack and how to wrap for shipments. Workplace was relaxing although there was no music. Hardest part of the job was when there would be a lot of priority shipments. Most enjoyable part of job is how everything is simple.
good,Don't get me wrong Amazon is an amazing company to work for they offer amazing health benefits and the company does its best to ensure that its employees and customers are happy. I truly love working for the company but unfortunately there is no real room for job advancement in the particular branch of amazon that I work in and while my coworkers and I get along like siblings and the work environment is both relaxed but fast paced at the same time its like I said there is just no room for advancement. The workplace culture focuses on making sure their employees are able to do there jobs to the best of there abilities with constant training and learning so as not to fall behind. The hardest part of the job is when we are unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion for a customer though those are few and far between as amazon is known for its customer obsession.The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to play with all the new gadgets that amazon is constantly improving and upgrading. All in all I am very grateful for the opportunity and chance that was given to me to work for such an outstanding company like Amazon.
good,Everyday is different. They may receive a big load or small either way they always have something for someone to do. It can be busy or slow like I said everyday is different.
good,A nivel Trabajo/ Staff muy buena experiencia. Todos predispuestos a ayudar y colaborar por un mismo objetivo. Es una empresa importante y gigante y el esfuerzo  laboral es mucho. Pero vale la pena
good,"Everyday you go into work knowing you have work to do. You go in and get right to work, getting a minimum of 500 picks by lunch time. I got a great deal of knowledge using scanners and the management was extremely helpful showing me what i didn't already know. The hardest part of the job was having to adjust to walking basically 11 hours straight. The most enjoyable had to be the competitive nature of the work force, pushing each other to reach new limits."
good,"After reading a bunch of whiny reviews on why it's so terrible to work for Amazon, I figured I'd give you the truth. Amazon is what you make of it. I love working here, and every aspect of the company in general. You are not a number. Stop whining and get up off your lazy butt and handle work. For me, it's a job, but it's also quite fun and everyday offers a new challenge. That's extremely satisfying to me to have new challenges each day to conquer."
good,I enjoyed my time at Amazon. I wish I never left I would go back in a heart beat . Very nice people and management . Job duties can be tough but paid well and amazing benefits.
good,"no matter where you go in the company your job will be rewarding, having a positive job culture is top priority all while making sure the customers of amazon are put first. amazon is an innovative work expression they hire and develop the best and seek out greatness with in each and every employee to get the best work for each and every day. there's plenty of room for growth within the company all you have to do is apply yourself"
good,"There was a dining area and 4 refrigerators and a Marketplace to purchase food.  They also had an entertainment area with a pool table and ping pong table.  There was also 1 side with computers that you could use on your breaks, lunch or dinner."
good,Okay so i come in go through the gates and go to the stand up and then go the employee stand up and exercise then go off to our station and sign into our scanners the wait for the item bins come to either count or verify the number of quality in the bins or damaged items. I learn that the you gotta exercise in the am or you can ware yourself out before your work shift is over and/or hurt yourself. Management was okay I guess cause you rarely see them. The hardest part will be I'll say staying focus and being the same spot for 10 hr shift just doing the same thing. The most enjoyable part is they let people know when they are doing a good job and stand up.
good,"cross training in other areas, steady pace great co workers. Peak time they do alot of fun things, Raffles clock in to win catered lunch, snack hand out"
good,Amazon.com is a good place to get alot of warehouse experience most managers very helpful lots of room for advancement . Would recommend to family and friends.
good,I enjoyed going to work and had new learning experience everyday and there was always growth opportunities available. The management was very friendly and easy to talk to. Promising company
good,The harder we worked they more we got to enjoy the fruits of our labor. Everyone there is very hands on at all times. On days when its slow we would get VTo which is Voluntary Time Off
good,Fun place to learn a lot in a little bit of time. Flexible schedules and teamwork. Good as a first job because it looks good on the resume. Would be better if you get a full time position.
good,"Was a Data Center Tech at AWS in Ashburn. "
good,"Amazon is like modern day slavery.The only difference is that we actually get payed well for our work. Other than that, they honestly don't care about anything but their money."
good,"had a very hard time finding a job when I first transitioned out of the military. No employers would give me a chance. out of the hundreds of jobs i applied for, I only got one call back. which turned out to be a waste of time.  I ended up going to a hiring event and amazon hired me on the spot. Highly recommend this company."
good,its was good i enjoyed target and new challages and fast pace .had to put itams away in spaces that were available for me to store into and also look for space that i can i store to what can be challaging
good,It is a multicultural workplace and people are very friendly.  Taught me a lot of new ideas and information. The management was very helpful and would support us throughout the journey.
good,"Planning surprise party's for each month when someone has a birthday decorating the cubic the day before the co-workers birthday's. Ordering food from uber eats, everyone getting together ordering big orders. The team work that everyone showed the friendliness of the office"
good,"Inbound customer inquiries, you have the flexibility to ensure each customers satisfaction. amazon is customer obsessed and as an employee, we are a customer of amazon's and they obsess over us which makes it easy for us to obsess over our customers."
good,I have a great time working here. Honestly my favorite job so far. The hours are good for overnight and you get paid more than other jobs. Definitely would reccommend to others.
good,"very very fast pace environment love working for amazon, but the job is for more hands on people not for the slackers. 10/10 for anyone who wants to work there"
good,The work culture is amazing. No discrimination of any sorts as you get work satisfaction along with cool bunch of workmates. Growth purely based on performance.
good,Working at amazon wasn't bad the only reason I had to quit was becaue I couldn't do the 6pm to 6am shift anymore and wasn't allowed to change it during peak season
good,"it was a really chill work place hardest part was finding the right bag for the packages to go into. We always got free food on break, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the people that you worked with."
good,Amazon was one if the best jobs I had I like how organized they are and you can really enjoy yourself working there. The managers are good they'll let you know when you're falling behind and will actually help you get back on track. The environment is good to it's a mixed diversity and everybody get along and is treated equally.
good,"Starting off the day i would get a scanner, look at the board to see what area i would be in get my orderpicker and start working. i would pick out items to be shipped out. the management was good. the bad thing about Amazon was HR, they wouldnt want to help others with needs. It was very fun working at Amazon."
good,A typical day at this job is a fast moving pace to exceed good productivity. Theie management are very friendly people willing to go out their way to help.
good,"Amazon took very good care of their employees. Fed us every week, had pot lucks. Game room. For the most part, people working there, had a good attitude and were excited about making the company better."
good,We need more management to keep an eye on giving swagg points to employers that's actually working hard and not taking often bathroom breaks. And they also needs to pay attention to detail uncomfortable situations some employers endure with other workers on the line.
good,I enjoyed packing because it was fast paced and easy to get through the longer hours while moving constantly. It was also nice to have benefis the day I started and being able to have paid time off if I needed to get to my daughter soon.
good,Managed your time and easy to follow the rules . You’re rate was based on how well you did at the job . All the rules are to keep you safe and there not meaning less at all .
good,I loved working at amazong! I wish I could of continued working  there it was a very good work environment that gave plenty of benefits. Hope I can find myself in more environments like this!
good,"Had the ability to learn new things over time . Great work environment including team work , supervisors were always there when you needed them. Clean and very organized."
good,This is a fun place to work with great things going on around the office. Very strict rules sometimes however these were from the agency and not amazon themselves.
good,"It is impressive how many intelligent people can work in one company. Diversity (in all senses) is welcomed and working with people from so many different backgrounds make my day even more interesting. "
good,at amazon you know what is expected of you and are given everything you need to be a success. work materials are all provided. training is very informative and management really will work with you in order to lead you to succeed at your position. the work culture is great fun to work with your co workers and is overall a great place to work short or long term.
good,"A day at Amazon is unique in its own way, different customers different opportunities to find different solutions for different problems."
good,If you are committed on working hard then amazon is the place for you. They offer so many benefits and pay you for your time correctly. The hardest part of the job are the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the diversity in the job itself.
good,I like working at Amazon I would go back in time but right now I won't to work back in Dietary  and housekeeping for now because the hrs are good  for me not to early in the morning
good,Overall good company  love the fast paced environment everyone came to do there job and go home the management is very helpful and answered questions on the spot if plausible

good,Working for Amazon wasn't bad at all I would still be there if I did not go to school for my Certification. It is place to climb the ladder. Benefits and pay are great as well
good,"Ich habe sehr gerne dort gearbeitet! "
good,i loved it until the managers started treating everyone like numbers and only cared about you working your self to death every second and when you would just make rate they would be down your throat about it...
good,"You'll be working a lot of hours but they train you, treat you right, and give you scheduling options to work with. Even with working 12+ hour shifts, I felt well treated."

good,"It's a layback job, but the hours are kind of hard and tiring.they have great benefits. the pay rate is also great. i really enjoyed working at amazon"
good,Great job and all the benefits but you are going to work your butt off!! Everyone is very nice and helpful and hr is right there to help when needed....
good,"I manage my own hours and am able to work from home from a company computer. I handle contacts about order issues, unknown charge, or assisting customers how to use the website. Overall its a pretty enjoyable job."
good,"Nice people working every one friendly "
good,great benefits. close to home with so many upcoming locations. recommend it to someone for a decent pay. been here 4 years and still enjoy it. great career options
good,I liked the work at Amazon. It was challenging and interesting. I really like that I was given a lot of responsibility right away. This gave me the opportunity to prove myself much quicker than I would have had in some other circumstances.
good,A great place for starting your career.Best work culture.No Night Shift.Perfect work-life balance.Salary hike is a pity thing.Fits as per Motto i mentioned in review summary
good,"If you listen to the tips the management team gives you, you can go far in this company with little to no problems.  A typical day consists of driving a fork truck down very narrow aisles collecting customer orders as safely and quickly as possible. The hardest part of the job, for me, was making the rate.  Most people can do it very easily, in a short amount of time.  I needed a little more than they were able to give me.  The most enjoyable part of the job was driving a forklift.  I had never driven one before, so that was fun.  And the management team was great.  The culture of Amazon is all about getting the job done, to the best of your ability, in the quickest amount of time, safely.  They don't want anyone hurt, but they also have a job to get done, just like any other company."
good,"amazon was a great work environment , good management team , very social , I learned a lot at amazon ,  met a lot of nice educated people , very helpful organization"
good,"Working in amazon have nice experience."
good,The job is very physically demanding but not too extreme. You have to be able to work at a fast pace. The break is a too short but all in all a nice place to work.
good,management was good.they need high ratings if we cannot do then one will be fired.salary is good but less as compared to rating expectations.first they give proper training after that one can start their job
good,"It wasn't a bad job, but it was physically demanding and fast paced. They wanted at least 280 units per hour and I just couldn't keep up. The pay is great and for those that can handle full time the benefits are excellent."
good,"Amazon is a good place of work where no experience is needed, all you have to do is to be determining and they are ready to train you on whatever you want to know. Amazon have a good management that do care about the safety of their employee."
good,Managers are a sometimes hardest part about the job is when they move ppl to different departments then your department is left short handed.  the most enjoyable thing about working at Amazon is peak season pay checks and vto.
good,I really enjoyed working here while I did. All of the supervisors and managers were very friendly and kept us motivated.The work was fast paced but easy to maintain. I would reapply.
good,I love working to the best because I believe that when a company succeeds there are rewards to its  its employees who benefit from that and also the customers who buy products from that company
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for. It's a fun, relaxed environment. I work from home as a reserve agent and it's very convenient considering I have a newborn."
good,"This company pays very well considering that very many people only have a high school diploma. There are also career opportunities available as well. Most fulfillment centers are on the 4- 10s schedule where you'll work 4 days and have 3 off if there is no overtime. The overtime pay is nice as well. I do not recommend working another full time job on top of this job because you will tend to burn out quicker and could risk losing one due to lack of quality in your production. Other than that, I enjoyed working for this company."
good,"working in a warehouse is usually irritating and boring, but at amazon it was kind of fun knowing what you would be doing and how long you would be doing it. With hour long breaks and music playing while you work i would have to say it was pretty cool working there."
good,Amazon was a good place to work I really enjoyed my 4 and a half years there. My typical day at work was Meeting targets scanning items and putting them on in locations. I enjoyed working part of a team and did well under pressure when we got really busy during the Christmas period.
good,"I work at night shift, Saturday, Sunday, monday and Tuesday 6h00 pm to 4h30 am. I working so hard."
good,"Amazon has gotten a lot of negative press lately. Yes its a hard job, yes they demand performance. They tell you this upfront and if you suck it up and do the work this is not an awful place."
good,pretty decent job. like the fact that there were different jobs to do so it was rarely boring. downside you don't always get the shift you request or need they stick you where they need you so it could be an inconvenience. Pay was good but it was only a part time facility.
good,"Amazon is a very good company to work for if I lived closer I would not be leaving.its fast pace and you only work 4 days a week ,sometimes there will be overtime."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for amazon as it is a good environment to be in as well as having a good pay and they are a fair company to work for."
good,The managers is really nice they respectable and understandable and the employees that I work with was respectable and helpful and i wouldn't mind working there again.
good,Working at Amazon as a customer service associate from home was awesome. It provided me the opportunity to not have to leave my house but still work a full time job. It was only temporary but the extensive training program really helped me in other areas of my professional life.
good,great company and allways growing very helpful and carring with employers great place to work not the best salary and a shame that the agency just give as temporary time ther
good,"Picking and packing in this company can be very fun when competing with others, not to much hard work gets put in a day. The managers are understanding and humble"
good,"Hard work, but great benefits and great coworkers. They pay well but if you're a part time worker you don't get a raise which they don't really tell you when you start. But they do help you pay for some school costs so that's pretty cool."
good,"I learn lots of skills in Amazon.Management skill like,time management,do a activity to keep customer in front of eyes while process,seller relationship."
good,"I enjoyed my Temp. Job here alot, and made many new friends! I wish the job lasted longer, like Temp to Permanent, but even the Ambassadors working there do not get a permanent position here."
good,"Worked wrapdown shift, we get the pallets to the lanes for the truckers to get out to the delivery stations. After we get the pallets moved and night shift leaves we set up for the next days operation. All team work and we have a great crew."
good,"Productive fun work place, 3 days of a week , occasionally give free lunches, great benefits, casual dress code, pto,upt,and vto available to you. Great supervisors"
good,"Management and working peers all make a job place you like working at."
good,"If your enjoy walking and having fun, then this the for you. It's a fast pace environment you have a to be open tho change. Working hard will be notice and you do have a great rewards."
good,I love working here but Im seeking for a fulltime. The managers are great as well as co-workers. It gets tiring at first but when you get used to it. Everything chnages.
good,"Great benefits, great pay (for unskilled labor). But working for 12 hours (I was weekend night shift) on poured concrete floor was murder on my body."
good,I start my day at 5pm in the evening and it end at 2 am. The place is an awesome one to work. The management is up to the mark.The work culture is free and easy to deal with.The hardest and fun part of job is that every case on which I work is absolutely different from the previous one.
good,"The job is fast pace and easy to learn at different areas. A diversified team environment and friendly co-workers. Hardest part of the job is knowing where you are located to work. The most enjoyable part is"
good,It was extremely hard to balance work . and Life . I would see a lot of people fall into pits of depression knowing they don't see the sun all day. Sad place to live
good,"Juggling schedule and coordinating meetings, reserving conference rooms, setting up video conferencing, updating powerpoint and excel presentations."
good,Working for the Amazon fulfillment center has been a great experience. The management team and human resources department are always very helpful and there to help you solve any issues that occur. The hardest part of the job would have to be working and standing on my feet doing physical labor for 10 hours per work day. The company offers great benefits as well as stock in the company once you have completed a full year working there.
good,"Si je pourrais j'y retournerais. "
good,"Fast paced days at work, constantly moving, stowing and packing shipments to be sent out. Be fast, management was nice and they try to help situations accordingly. Peak seasons are the most busy and difficult times of the job. Amazon has 2 each year.  The people who work there and outgoing and they were the best part of the job."
good,"Great place to find trends and create proactive projects to tackle new issues. However, leadership/team dynamics can really make or break team morale."
good,Challenging bundling metal together making stacks on wood pellets. Stacking wood boards on a wood pellets and keeping it stacked up all the same. Picking metal off floor n separating it from a 14 inches metal to 8 inches.
good,Had a great experience with Amazon Web services. Great work life balance and they know how to take care of their employees. I can say that most employees of the company have an enjoyable experience.
good,I want to that i m good person because Focus on work not in party that it. I do work harder give 100 percent in my company. I love this company and work for my self

good,"It is a employee centric company and very good place to work with, The great support from the management. You feel like as if your in your home. If your performance is really good you can easily grow within an organization."
good,"Processing all of the packages that are damaged, into the computer properly, ensure that the data is accurate and quickly entered in so it gets sent to the proper sortation center. Scanning, sorting and managing the warehouse, guiding hundreds of people per shift, while ensuring the strict company policies are clarified to each customer and keeping the persistently busy delivery demand on schedule, organized and full of happy customers."
good,"It's amazing place to work, very interesting to deal with US customers. We prepare daily, weekly, monthly data. Am part of transaction team. Gud experience"
good,For the last 6 months I have been designing Facilities and making important changes in already structured buildings. I was taught so much with dealing with vendors to construction managers.
good,"amazon is widely known, for very good reasons might i add. management always makes sure workers are motivated and constantly working. The work environment isnt bad, its just work, work, work."
good,"Amazon was overall an excellent company to work for. I couldn't stay long term due no high school diploma or GED. Therefore, I could only work for the holiday seasons."
good,this is one of the most easy job ever. They offer so many jobs for people. They give you so many ways to take time of. That help to take care of things and family.
good,"During peak season you have work to do but when there's no peak, it gets ready slow and you're just standing half the night just looking around because you can't have your phone and there's nothing else to do unless you're okay with talking to a random person every other night."
good,Can be very physical and manual labor one day or standing at a station the next day.  It's a diverse setting of people with mostly friendly atmosphere
good,"I've worked so many jobs in the past that were riddled with dozens of underlying problems for the associates who worked there. Whether its the lack of proper work equipment, poor treatment from fellow co workers or management, or just simply inadequate staffing, every job had something. Amazon is a little different, they take the time to make sure their employees are as happy as their customers are, and even though there is always room for improvement, they do their best to make sure their employees are taken care of."
good,I really enjoyed working there. I had the best supervisors and teams to work with. I was sad to leave for I had to move to another state so. I had to quit
good,"A typical day at amazon is very fast paced."
good,One of the best company you could get to work in. It has been a fantastic experience till now with the company. They listen to all  problems of the employees and look for the welfare and benefits of the employees. The company always prioritizes the long term goals rather than the short term success.
good,nice work place to work the only bad thing i'd say about them is don't go into a seasonal position thinking they are going to hire you on the chances are highly unlikely
good,"well,"
good,"Having good experience in amazon, hearing songs, working environment was good, learned about thin client , management was friendly , enjoyed lots of time."
good,"it was a great job, but sometimes i think amazon can be too politcally correct, they have great benefits for the employee but they also need to take care of the employee too"
good,"Leadership greet you with a smile at the begging and at the end of the day, My day start off by seeing were I have to work for that day, go to the morning meeting and sign into my work station. The hardest part about the job is the heat and the best is that I can come to work and leave as I please as long as I Have time."
good,Make history. Word Hard. Have Fun. First job experience was great. Worked as an intern and a full time associate. Great workplace. Helped develop leadership qualities.
good,This was one of my favorite jobs! It kept me active and on the go which I really like. I was able to explore many different parts of LA and see how beautiful this city truly is.
good,"The work environment there is often fast paced.The management could be better.The hardest part of the job would be the pace at which things would need to be done,the most enjoyable would  be the people"
good,"Enjoyed working in the fast paced Amazon environment.  I gained a great knowledge in a number of job fields.  Great work schedule included four 10 hour days, except during peak season.  Management was easy to work.  Typical workplace culture."
good,"Growth opportunities is less here, even if you perform well it doesn't gets noticed, otherwise salary is on time, great working atmosphere,seniors are really helpful"
good,It has been a great experience so far! I love my job. The managers listen to your concerns and are very helpful. I'm glad to be a part of this team! No complaints
good,Very productive and fast paced it's a competitive job but they make it fun & they motivate you to keep going they give out prizes and if we met the goal that we set they give us pizza and chick-fil-a it's a demanding job but worth it.
good,I enjoy selling affiliate products and they make it easy for anyone to promote their products.  There are hundreds of products to choose from to promote.
good,"Fun job. Everyone that works for Amazon that I have encountered have been great, helpful people. I deliver packages to customers that have become members of the Amazon Prime program. The hardest part of the job is getting the block of hours to work that week. Other than that, I honestly have no complaints."
good,Usually 4-5 hour shifts where you are handling packages. You get different jobs everyday and are trained in every part on orientation. Recommended for full-time students.
good,"As part of the overnight warehouse team, I help to scan in packages that come in from the fulfilment center and stow away package then load them into the vans for the drivers toward the end of the shift. It is a physically demanding job, and is very diverse. Management is cool and dont treat you like robots, while still being professional and maintaining order. Mandatory (well needed break). Hardest part of the job is staying level headed with the fast pacedness. Everything else is pretty easy peasy"
good,I like to keep my self busy working I like to meet new people and work together with respect and I also like to learn new things in my life I usually work very good at warehouse and driving skills I can read and write English Turkish Russian I live here Louisville ky bronner cir 40218

Not as bad as you might think as long as you dress warm . They give you everything you need meaning - hat, face mask, vest , gloves for every climate , box cutter etc."
good,very fast paced work environment but the pay was very fair for the job. Good benefits and fun environment. The day was over before you knew it because of the fast paced work there. Very good pay! Best place I ever worked for!
good,Great place to work. The management are super nice and understanding. Only difficult part about the job is having to deal with constant customer problems throughout the day.
good,Working as a team.leader good rate targets  good atmosphere good overtime good company team leaders helpful support the teams targets good company to work for good benefits
good,"I worked at MCO5 (Davenport, FL). It's a part time job, 4-5hours 5 days a week. Great work environment. Management is ok. Most employee talk and take it easy. I am the type of person that is always productive and like to be kept busy at work. It's unfair how there are employees who are good workers and then there are those who talk and stand most of the shift. It's supposed to be a ""team"" job. Good pay. Amazon is a good place to work."
good,"good place, busy place, being in good shape is a pulse, good people, will loose weight, nice perks, 10 hr. shifts, Amazon is a good place to work long days"
good,i liked the time i worked here. plenty of chances to advance. bad thing almost no down time break is only  15 min long 5 of which you spend trying to get from your location to the break room.
good,"Friendly place to work, great area to work, room for good career prospects, promote from within, great training for all employees, great for the hospitality industry."
good,"we come clock in at 6pm everyday, at Amazon I have learned to work in revive, stow, water spider, pack and drive an order picker, my manager is the best manager you cold ask for, they are always all about their workers and making sure everything moves smoothly throughout the shift. Its a very warm and welcoming environment to work in, everyone gets along with everyone, I think the hardest part of our job is when we have a whole lot of things to do in to little time and the most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to come to work and see everyone's smiling faces."
good,"It's a great job if that's what you like to do. Take the same calls over and over. Do some refunds, check tracking, and send out replacements. Occasionally get an irate customer who's yelling at you even when you're trying to help them."
good,A typical day usually consists of picking items for customers orders for 10 hours out of the day. My coworkers were easy and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for 10 hours with only an hour break throughout the day.
good,excellent job performing daily duties of loading and unloading truck driving vehicle on routes delivering packages up too 85lbs and performing daily inspections and logs.
good,"The environment n the team members including higher officials are very friendly and are there to help to you 24*7 whenever​ you need them! "

good,awesome company to work for good work ethics and customer obsession and also bonuses upset i was not able to stay but enjoyed my time there they care about  there employees family
good,"fast paced fair place to work if u do your job right and stay on task, short breaks but implies discipline for ya later down the road. good pay with excellent benefits"
good,"1. Word - awesome "
good,Its a pretty fun face paced environment. Of course i depends on your management team. I was apart of a new logistics team that opened upa warehouse in Chesapeake VA. We blast music every night and we joke around to make the night pass by faster. Benefits are lacking and the pay is on the lower side as far as overnight work goes but i've seen worst. This should be a second job.
good,"it gets a little to lonely for me in there i'm more interactive and positive when i'm with and constantly talking to multiple people, great management and communications through teams."
good,i enjoyed my time working with this company i walked a lot we were constantly busy always something to do i really enjoyed the people i met here left a wonderful impression
good,"Amazon is the ideal place to work.  They expect hard work but know that you have a life outside of the office.  The culture is ultra-laid back and cool.  Lots of sandals and shorts.  Meetings are frequent, but laptops can be out so important work can continue."
good,"Typically face paced environment. Never forget your ID badge, entry without it takes a few minutes or more and that time is docked. For sure find the best insoles on earth because you will be standing 10 hours plus and your feet will not adjust to the concrete floors. You can not transfer until you have worked 90 days. It may be tough, but worth it if you don't mind a hectic environment."
good,Such a one of the Amazing company which is involved totally maintenances factor to the employees.Employee can work free like this Organisation. I glad to work in Amazon.
good,"I was in the IT department. The only issue was a lack of opportunities for advancement within that department."
good,"Working as a fulfillment associate was very fast paced. Involved constant mental concentration and was physically demanding. I really liked the position and worked there twice seasonally during peak season. The management was very aggressive about employee safety and meeting rate goals. The workplace was clean, and safe, only wish there were a few more bathrooms for such an enormous warehouse. The hardest part of the position was the sore feet, and extremely short breaks but they were understandable for peak season. The most enjoyable part was the leniency in dress code, the constant incentives to meet goals, and the fair pay rate/benefits."
good,"Deliver a wide variety of items to different addresses and through different routes"
good,"I work at their delivery station 2-6 am. Great hours for school. Management is laid back as long as you are doing your job. Job is very easy, all you do is scan in packages and sort them. Time flies by!"
good,"I loved working  for Amazon, A typical work day. I don't think there ever was such a day. After clocking in for the day we would rally together listen to a son or two to get us pumped  for our morning or afternoon stretches  ,Yes we do them, to get us ready for the day .I loved that part.  I loved the whole job, the job was very physical which I loved the hardest part at first was learning how  to build a pallet properly  and carrying big heavy boxes from the conveyor belt to the pallet that the matched the number and letter on the box  to the pallet. Eventually  I learned how to build a proper pallet  and I learned how  to base wrap the pallet. The most enjoyable part about   the job ,was the people  and the  job  its  self I never stayed in one place I was constantly moving constantly doing  something I was  always learning  something new. whether I was a splitter, or pick off ,or just  a scanner for the day  I loved my work at  Amazon. As far as management goes they are  Amazing"
good,Mi sono trovata bene anche se la mia esperienza di lavoro e durata poco.
good,"this workplace has had a great vibe with helpful people. On a typical day is an everyday routine, come to work, do you job as told and make sure you get it done on time before the timer runs out. The workplace culture is simple but interesting people, all kinds of people. The hardest part of this job was having a timer that gives you very limited time to pick the product and give it to the packers for shipping."
good,"I learned a lot of organizational skills and how to work in a time crunch. The people were always helpful, and they would work with your schedule. I mostly enjoyed my time there."
good,"We would walk in and have a standup on how much goes out the day of work. Stretch, that part they put very important but only stretch for like 30 seconds. I learned so much on picking, Packing , ship dock. I learned on how to drive a order picker and pack items and ship them out. The hardest part of the job is working with no work. The best part is making friends and enjoying your co workers to help make the day go faster."
good,"Great place to work, lots of perks, room for advancement, lots of extra overtime during peak hours and training available for other positions within company."
good,"I enjoyed working with all the people present. The atmosphere was not team work oriented. There were only a few people that were recognized as doing overachieving results. All people should have been commended as a team to promote better results and lower the turnover. After a while the job is boring and does not give the feeling of a superior performance. Positives give energy and negatives take energy. The atmosphere was more negative than positive, overall."
good,"Amazon has been great, I work nights and it's rough the first three weeks but afterwords you adjust. It's labor intensive job but your body adjusts accordingly, blisters go away and your back stops aching. Give it a month before you give up. I've recently even had my schedule accommodated with my school schedule. The ability to call in when I need is stress free. You're given a certain number of hours off and can use as needed. Take the day off, or 1 hr for running in late."
good,"Wonderful at home job opportunity.  Great for the disciplined individual who is somewhat computer savvy.  No commute, no boss looking over your shoulder, no peers to get in your way.  This is an incredible company with lots of growth potential."
good,Wonderful company to work for.  Great culture and diverse staff.  Management goes out of their way to make each and every employee feel special and succeed.

good,Its great company to work for. They have excellent benefits for each employee. They allow you to move up to other positions to improve yourself. They have programs out there help you excel in life.
good,The place is great the hours are hard and the standing and walking takes getting use to. They have helped me a lot since my arm got hurt cant complain great managers.
good,"I uses to work 40 hours a week. Sometimes early shift and sometimes late shift which is not a problem for me. I've learnt a lot about customer advisor and how to help people with they problems delivery. What I most the like in this job was to rassure people that they will be refund or they will be receive ana another package really quickly. The hardest part was sometimes to calm down people whom were very upset. "
good,"Environment and atmosphere promote good work ethic, co-workers are more like family."
good,"I work overnight at a warehouse, handling boxes, management seem to be very helpful . I enjoy interacting with my coworkers. the job is not difficult at all ."

good,"I start my day at 15:00 and finish at 00:00. I assist customers with Prime Video and Twitch Prime subscriptions. I start relatively early as I'm always working over time, then I set myself up and communicate with customers from all around the world via phone, email and chat. I've learnt how to provide the best customer service by treating my customers as friends. Expressing empathy is everything when working at Amazon. I adore management, especially their style of management. The environment is laid back and anybody that works for Amazon knows that you're self managed. The culture is vibrant and energetic. Amazon offers opportunities for growth and development. The hardest part of my job is providing customers with the best customer service via email and the best part of my job is providing customers with the best customer service through any platform."
good,"AMAZON cultive une histoire depuis sa création, ainsi que de nombreuses stratégies et se développe et se diversifie à travers le monde. la mise en place de nouvelles applications multimédia en sont la preuve. Le management et les techniques de production sur les sites de production sont la clé de la performance"
good,"* A supportive management,"
good,Amazon has an amazing work-culture and is a wonderful place to grow professionally. It focuses on customer satisfaction which speaks a lot about the company's values and goals.
good,"typical work day would be ever changing and challenging. Yet management always showed support to Process Assistants."
good,"4 day work week"
good,"There are a lot of different jobs within the company, most of which are repetitive. You can kind of shut off your brain and just do the work, so there's a lot of time to think or hum to yourself.I personally loved working for Amazon. It is one of those jobs that you either really love or really don't. I made a game out of seeing how fast I could go while still being accurate."
good,"With a customer obsessed corporate culture, AMAZON.com provides each employee the opportunity to ""own it"" and take charge of their individual employment horizon."
good,its a good place to work for beginners its a fast moving place and with a lot of challenges with you need to work hard for a long time to make it there on top

good,"Great all around company that pushes associates to do there best great benefits paid vacation, paid time off, overtime availability"
good,Very customer centric  company who realizes we are human.  You will typically take over 300 calls a month but the calls are not hard to handle.  You are well trained and prepared.  Great place to work.
good,Had lots of fun learning and meeting new people there. Wish I was able to move up within the company but quess it wasn't meant for me.
good,"It is one of my favorite past times. Would love to make it into a career but good things take time right?! Love the easy formatting, the variety that is available and how easy it is to use."
good,"you work to the bone, but you are well compensated for your time. Plenty of advancement to be had as long as you are willing to sacrifice your time for it. all in all it's  great place to be."
good,"Basically, your job is to mantain a continues fast space."
good,"The work was difficult, but the pay was good and I had fun with the other associates that I worked with. I didn't have much of any problems at work. Management was pretty nice too. Some of the people were rude, but overall it wasn't too bad."
good,This company is great in terms of benefits and work culture. Pay is also very good here as well with many opportunities for advancement. If you are lucky enough or skilled enough to get a tier 3 position or higher take it and run with it.
good,Great place to work. I have only been working there for about a few weeks but so far it's nothing too difficult. A lot of walking but other than that's it's a good place.

good,Amazon.com is a good place to work. They challenge their people to break records. They work very well with veterans and people in the National Guard.
good,"Amazon is a very cultural  work place its fun to meet different employees from all over the world. Management and everything about the place is very organized very well.In order to work at amazon you have to be able to work hard and work long shifts daily. The hardest part of the job is the parking lot having patience with the long traffic that comes with working at a very large building. I've learned how to stay focus for a long period of time, how to talk to be people who knows little English, how to act under pressure, and how to be a hard working employee."
good,expect to work in a fast paced fun environment..i had a wonderful expirence working here..there was always some type of excitement to look forward to when you come into work whether it was the am's or the co workers
good,I have worked for amazon  fulfilment centre twice and have done picking receiving packing and intent to learn more as I want to advance within the company . And earn my blue badge as a full time associate .
good,This was a great company to work for. They have so many opportunities to advance in the company. They help you with school. Just come in give your all and you'll be rewarded.
good,the day started with stretching then depending on what department needed help I would help in each department. The most enjoyable part working on the holidays they made it fun and you left with gifts.
good,"L'entreprise est jeune, dynamique. "
good,Hard work and fast paced with a very positive goal oriented company.  Shifting protocol and phases between holiday goals and reduced work can confuse.
good,"This job was great other than me standing on my feet the whole 12hrs ...the people were nice, great food.  Great place too work..."
good,I had a great time while working here. At times its a little hot. Breaks are 15 minutes and lunch is 30 minutes. 4 days work and 3 days off which is nice

good,Awesome environment that encourages working hard and having fun while keeping focused on the ultimate goal of the business. I look forward to work.
good,"The project work assigned to me involved heavy application of algorithms and data structures, something I am really passionate about. My team was extremely helpful in ramping me up with the initial environment set up which can really be complex in a company like Amazon which has humungous dimensions of platforms and dependencies and can be overwhelming for a new employee."
good,"•	As an Area Sales Manager I was responsible for overseeing the sales operation of specific geographical area which includes the following Eastern region & Lucknow, Kanpur."
good,"A good place to work, good benefits, great incentives for performance. the hardest part of the job is getting use to standing for 10 sometimes 11 hours a day."
good,"my experience with Integrity Staffing @ Amazon FC was a very learning experience.  I was hired in as an OB Packer in the warehouse; after a couple of months I was promoted to Focus Coach where I assisted the warehouse associates to ""make rate"" (Amazon FC work is based on rates per hour and if an associate does not meet the required rate their assignment/job is ended).  I succeeded in that position from there I was promoted to Seasonal HR Coordinator then on to a permanent staff HR Coordinator.  Being able to be promoted within a short amount of time and to the level of where I went says alot for a company that they believe in their employees and will promote from within.  Although the hours are very hectic I loved my job and the people I worked with.  Each and everyone I came in contact with would do whatever needed to help you succeed in your job.  Definitely a team oriented company.  Highly recommend"
good,Working at Amazon has been a very exciting experience both personal and professional. This job has given be the opportunity to explore abilities that allowed me to grow and get stronger.
good,"Taking in 80-150 calls a day was the typical day for all workers. All employees would first check into any promises made to customers and follow up with any results. While working for the company, it improved my ability to research in a limited amount of time. We were expected to learn the entire amazon system within the first 2 weeks of starting. The program given was huge and had a very specific way of finding the correct topic that you needed in order to help the current customer. My co-workers were very nice and would be more than willing to help me or anybody with any issues that they were having. The hardest part of the job would be making sure that everything was correct for the customer that we were assisting. The system was very huge and was very easy to get lost in it while looking at something for the customer. I enjoyed how professional the company was and how they handled everything. They treated their workers very fair and even closed the site in order to host an event for the workers. They also gave customer support power to almost do anything as long as we thought that it was fair."
good,"I thouroughly enjoyed the short time spent at Amazon. Unfortunately in my case, I had to resign die to personal reasons. Overall a good experience at Amazon."
good,"Loved it, sadly had to leave because I went off to college. The company it self is very comfortable to work in, not too strict, which makes someone want to be there. Never went to work upset about having to go/"

good,"I had a very good experience with Amazon. With a willingness to work hard and devote your time at work to fulfilling the basic requirements of the job, all workers were eligible for advancement and appropriately compensated for their work.  The management also seemed committed to supporting all the associates and creating a friendly and productive atmosphere."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. A typical day at work requires timely completion of picking and packing operations. Speed, adaptibility and quality of work are the best things i learned from amazon. Management was held responsible for all the situations and managing their employees effeciently.Co-workers were fun to work with and also supportive. Hardest part of the job was to meet quality. The most enjoyable part of the job is the speed and no stress situation involved."
good,i loved working here was fun and the employee were great the managers where awesome ive worked 12 hour shifts and decided to move back up north.......
good,"Excellent exposure while working in the largest e-Commerce company in the world. Jobs are interesting, mentors are brilliant, overall work atmosphere is great."

good,"Easily the best warehouse environment included with the best people, from the basic associate to the location supervisor. Everyone is so helpful, considerate, and kind throughout the work day/night, even when things aren't going well for the warehouse. Definitely great as a first job."
good,"I worked at Amazon for 4 months during the Holiday season. It was a tough work day, in which, I trained and led new employees on the ins and outs of storehouse routines. I also helped solve day to day problems that arose in the store house."
good,"Great company to work for that allows continuous improvement.  It doesn't matter what position you are or how long you have worked for the company, you have the chance to promote quickly and be recognized fast if you work hard."
good,A day at work all work no play. I learned to productive with my time and management always worked with me. My co workers were outstanding to work with especially with all the different cultures and personalities. The hardest part of the job was standing for most of the work time. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the new people and just adding a new experience to my life to learn and better myself as an individual.
good,This is a nice place to work with nice and learning environment. Management is supporting and they really take care of the employees in a very nice way.
good,Work 10 hour shift for 4 days accept for seasonal 5 days 11 hours shift. They are always room for advancement..Co- workers are easy to get a long with because we understand the job. Standing all day tends to leave body sore. Winning prizes for power hour.
good,"If you are looking for a fast paced and energetic environment, this is the place. This is a large organization. Some people come to do their job from 9-5 and go home. Some come for the incredible amounts of projects, opportunities to show they can rise to the top, so it can get competitive. You're now competing with so many other bright people. But in the end, it's one of the most friendly, fun, and down to earth places I've ever worked. From jeans and t-shirts to dresses and jogging pants to slacks. Basically, you can be yourself at all times. You can't tell from a top leader to an intern, as everyone is treated as equals. Last but not least, Amazon stocks are performing phenomenally!"
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon. I learned a lot about hard work, time management and the convenience of online ordering. A typical day at work went by very quickly as it was always busy. We were coached and trained very well to ensure we could meet the expected requirements at hand. I met many people from different walks of life whom I still keep in contact with today."
good,Amazon cultural is fantastic. It has friendly work place. No sir mam cultural. Growth is rapid. Management is just unbelievable. Facilities are also good.
good,Amazon is a nice environment to work for because the HR department allways look after its employees and the HR is flexible for dealing with employees inquiries. Working at amazon is safe because they take health and safety very seriously.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. Besides the manual labor that can be physically challenging at times there was alot of incentives and bonuses for employees.
good,It is a good company but with no job security. Amazon makes more investment on employees for making them comfortable. They provide the best training for the employees. Company provides a friendly culture to employees.
good,"I love that I came across this job opportunity when I had. My youngest son had just turned 5 months and I was ready to return back to work but had been worried about leaving my baby so soon. The hiring process went quickly and smoothly, only downside to working from home is you have to travel to complete your I-9 registration. "
good,Až na dojíždění spokojenost.Vynikající pracovní podmínky
good,"The work culture is nice, the pay is good, the management is awesome, the breaks are well placed time wise, and the break areas are well situated"
good,"At Amazon, I was able to learn how to process merchandise for delivery load trucks for delivery and other things requested."
good,"In a days work I would package and build boxes sending them the ""line"" for the packages to be sent to the customers. I would also load trailers and sort packages throughout the shift."
good,Overall I loved working at Amazon. It was only a seasonal job but I did enjoy working there. I would have to say the hardest part of the job for me was making sure I was picking and locating items by the required speed. The management were all friendly and nice. They were very welcoming about speaking to them about any questions or concerns that I had. The co-workers were nice as well. The thing that I enjoyed most about the job was learning something new everyday. I strong believe there is something that can be learned everyday. And I'm very open to learning something new everyday.
good,Amazon is a great place to work if your looking for something stable and compensation is good for an entry level job. opportunity for career advancement and lots of enjoyable job roles. management is effective and reliable. Fun people to work with. the most difficult part of this job is repetitive actions and hours per day 10 hour shift's or 11 when on overtime. best part of this job is you wont be bored and the teamwork you will find working here creates a truly motivating work place.
good,Amazon is a good start up and it was a good platform. It is best in context of Work Culture and freedom in environment. The cons in being in this company is inside management. It has bias management with leads to groom and restrict us to grow.
good,"from the first day walking in I knew I was going enjoy working at amazon, everyone from the security to upper management just seemed to be so happy to be at work. I've learned that taking peoples view into consideration you can come up with great ideas and solutions."
good,When you work hard you play hard. At amazon I learned that you have to take ownership of your business. If you don't agree with a decision disagree and commit. Remain composed at all times and have fun.
good,"It is a great place to learn, grow and network. Typically a day would consist of meeting all members of the team, learn from mistakes and improve process. Management is helpful or vision and allow for a lot of fun at workplace. Hardest part was to leave."

good,"6am-4:30pm shift"

You have that self accomplishment overall. It felt great working with such a diverse group of people."
good,"Work is very enjoying if colleagues are supportive and friendly, it makes one put more effort. Helping and supporting others is an enthusiasm that I enjoy. Management is about empowering and identifying talents in employees, planning, organising, coordinating and controlling the entire resources of the organisation to archieve its goals. The hardest part of job is when you put your best and the management does not appreciate it. I learned to coordinate with relevent employees, to put my best and organise my tasks to achieve targets."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people while working at Amazon. All the managers and supervisors made the work environment fun for all the workers while maintaining a productive work day.
good,its a great place to work the workers are nice and willing to help wouldnt mind working there again. You get great hours long shifts but its worth it.
good,Great people to work with. Had many opportunities to advance in my career. Great job for someone who is just starting out in life.
good,It a great company to work in your teenager living to get through college. I start at Wendy's in 2013 and three months later I was promoted to one of the shift managers.
good,"A typical day at work would be loud, crowded and very busy. Working at such worldwide company like Amazon taught me how to communicate with co-workers, be patient, use a PDF scanner and work at a fast pace. Amazon management was up to part some- what, sometimes it was hard to find the help and answers you needed for ambassadors and mangers. Co-worker were always friendly and talkative, it was never hard to find friends. The hardest part of the job was finding space in the warehouse to do your work it super crowded always people around, sometimes their were some areas that was free. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and being around different cultures."
good,"You were expected to work like robots, almost everyday was spent doing with the same jobs. You were never offered the chance the be accepted for higher jobs, unless you were popular within the company or had any kind of contacts. I sued to get on with the previous management team within my department but never seems to click on with the new management because I was the only female within the whole team."
good,"sort parcels into routes and then scan all parcels with a hand scanner to confirm all parcels are in the right routes, the management were easy to get on with and co workers are quick to help if you get overrun with parcels the hardest part of the job is not being off at the weekend and the best part is that you are under no pressure doing the job"
good,"Dynamic work culture and adaptive policies."
good,"Productive working environment and staff are friendly. I enjoyed that I was given straightforward tasks and if I had any problems, I would be listened to carefully."
good,"A day working for amazon usually starts off whenever you log on to your account. If your well of to have employees, then your day pretty much starts with your email and a phone call or two. I begin to go through orders, which are being deployed in real time, and which are for the future. After this, I begin to package and print labels for the items being shipped in real time, and occasionally for the ones in the future. I have learned that if your employee cannot differentiate between sensitive items (a specific color, and size), then presort yourself and have them do the easy stuff, print labels and stick them on to the package, and stick the item that has already been sorted, into the package. I have also learned that you must get your hands a little dirty, as in do some of the work yourself, handle any customer concerns yourself, and even returns, to better learn what it is that is or could be going wrong with that aspect of the business. This gave me insight on to whom would be qualified to fill in the position, once expansion was within potentiality, and within the budget. "
good,"I like and am still working here but I am just looking for a better career that pays more to join.This company is good to work for but advancement only goes so far without a degree here so I am looking for something new.I work four, ten hour days in a row a week and have been promoted to process assistant already while being there.The most enjoyable thing about working here at amazon would have to be watching and helping the development of the associates you are around daily.I take great pride and pleasure in this.I learned a lot while working here and have taught even more to others I have trained while here.I have learnt more about computers and programs on them like Microsoft office,word,Excel and others.I also learned how to manage and run a team of 20 plus associates very efficient in the processes needed at amazon.It is just time for a change and something better."
good,"amzone is great company . i hop me part of this company and in joy"
good,A very dynamic and fast paced environment to work at Amazon.com. It's a life time opportunity to work with the team what I believe is. I would never look back and happy to work with Amazon if I get a chance again.
good,"I worked at PHX3, which means nothing if you don't know what that is. Starting pay is amazing, advancement is quite easily acquired if you show them you want it. Amazon truly cares about their employees. During peak seasons they have raffles, DJ's, games, contests, free food. And also great management year 'round. The only thing i disliked about working there, was the amount i time i had off. I admit, he paychecks every week was well worth it, but being a full time student, 55-60 hours a weeks is tough. Night shift is the best at Amazon, in my opinion. I was a picker and walked about 15 miles on a normal 10 hour shift, 5 days a week. Pretty crazy, right? That is also a pro, getting paid to exercise, basically. (:"
good,i can't say enough about this company that makes it a great place to work. the only thing i regret is that this was a temporary position.
good,The compny is a great comany to work for the work is just physically exhausting.I is alot of mangers you neve truly know who to listen to.
good,"young  and qualified staff ,fun work place , enough working hours per week , safe working area ,great variety of things to learn"
good,"people are great, A fun place to work management can be little unorganized making rate can be hard most enjoyable is vibe the people give when you enter the building"
good,"Amazon was awesome love the programs and workshops that was available to employees. Also we where able to earns bucks that could buy items out of our store. Within your teams meeting you where able to win gifts and free parking spaces. You definitely exercise a lot which was great, needed it in my life. Very fast pace environment, but easily to find guidance along the way. Great place for personally growth and development. Also great for relocating."
good,"There are many benefits to working for a company like Amazon."
good,Amazon is a great company to work with. I get paid good and they are very understanding. Amazon has a goal...and they go above and beyond to take care of their customers.
good,"The work is intense, but fair, considering the compensation offered. The culture allows for good relationships and opportunities for advancement present themselves to those who are seeking them out. Management leaves something to be desired in respect to good communication, but in a warehouse with over 5,000 staff members, it makes sense."
good,"learnt marketing skills, such a wonderful place to work, as said, wok hard have fun, managers were helpful, totally amazing experience."
good,amazon is a place where it is getting improved and famous day by day.. a very high growth has been seen these days.. reputation is also good..
good,"Ik zou zelf weer bij Amazon willen werken. Het is kei gezellig en het hulp van mijn manager en team leiders was echt top. Meestal wouw ik 24 uur per dag werken omdat ik het leuk vond  om met klanten te werken via email. "
good,"My day start off by preparing work, I create batches and distribute the work load every 11/2 to 2 hours in a 10 hour work day. I also resolve any variance that may occur, such as erroneous products received or incorrect quantity. The management is awesome but precise. The job is easy and stress free but there is times where the bottle neck process can be intense but that occurs mostly during peek season."
good,"Amazon has wonderful work environment. Policy was to work hard, have fun and make history. I did all the three. "
good,Fun work place very busy days. Managers were very helpful. At least mine were. I hit every rate I was supposed to. In pack singles the rate was 66. I hit 70 to 100. In AFE the rate was 120 an hour and i was at 180 too 218 an hour. I also worked the docks for 6 months. I moved the fastest it was me and two other people all day. All in all i would say Amazon was the perfect work place. And now I only want to work in wear houses.
good,"My day start with team briefings , assigning task to sub ordinates."
good,"Extremely fun place to work. Challenging work load but this has to be expected at a company with such a reputation and force. Fantastic management support and on site training, great opportunities to grow."
good,the hardest part of the job is the fact that have to leave work late this sometimes provides some difficulties as i have to drive late. i like working in this company because i have made some great friends which i would've not met if i wasn't working here.
good,I would get there early to make sure I was not late. I would clock in and we would have standup which meant we would listen to the managers tell us how good we are doing or what we needed to improve on. Then we would exercise by stretching and other stuff. I had good coworkers most of all of us got along with each other. It was a good professional environment. The hardest part of my job would be keeping up with the weekly rate which I did but we all struggled with it. The most enjoyable part was Driving machinery. I did not really standing in one spot fixing boxes for the product to be shipped. I helped train people to drive order pickers and do their jobs.
good,"Good company with great atmosphere. Its fine when you are a fresher and as the time passes, Amazon fails to promote you or increase the salary which drastically reduces the performance of the employees."
good,"One of the area's largest employers yet behaves in many respects like a small, dynamic company. Encourages and rewards employee contribution to improvements in all facets of the organization."
good,"I loved working at Amazon. I was in a smaller division that operated more like a startup and gave me a high degree of autonomy while also allowing me to feel like I was contributing in a meaningful way. I set my own hours (within reason), could work from home at times, and generally found it to be a manageable workload that was handled in a fair and well-planned-out way. My managers were great and I was able to be very direct with them, control my career, and generally do what I wanted to do with myself in terms of side projects and advancement."
good,We are a growing company with a lot of advancement.  Great benefits with fun jobs to do!  My co workers are so fun to work with!
good,"One of the best places to grow in career and in life as a person."
good,Was about getting your numbers and keeping them up. I learn that you have to be fast with finishing a cart when you get it. The management was great. The coworkers was sometime fun but not all the time. There was really no hard part of that job it was fairly easy to me. I enjoyed the work.
good,"Amazon is an excellent place to work; the management teams are approachable, cordial and eager to help you succeed."
good,"The job was fun and exciting, the co workers was really nice and fun to get along with, they were helpful. Management was also helpful. T he most enjoyable part of the job was moving around to each conveyor belt and helping them out."

good,"The day at work used to be all exciting at Amazon and there were new challenges to be faced every day, and the management was supportive to deal with the challenges and to stand as an individual performer."
good,"The job itself can be a bit repetitive for some. However if you put in effort there are plenty of opportunities to learn some thing new, maybe even move onto the next level. It is a very diverse working environment with people from different cultures and ethnic backgrounds."
good,It is very good paying job but the on your feet is a killer unless you got healing salt ready. it was very fast pace and moving which I like.
good,Initial gather and goal planning would take place before executing our quota or work load for that selected day. After we meet our goals we have opportunities to persue daily prizes.
good,"The work is hard, it is a long day.  10 hour shifts.  I work from 6:00 pm to 4:30am so it is tough on the rest of my schedule.  The work tends to feel a little robotic after awhile.  Compensation and benefits are very good.  Very modern and clean workplace."
good,Seeing my best efforts produce positive results and enjoying successes with my co workers is rewarding for me.  A typical day is to be ready each minute for the unexpected and to rise to each occasion as it presents itself.
good,This is a contracting company. There is little interaction with them after the initial hire. They would take us to lunch or happy hour about once a month. I have had them contact me while working for other jobs way before my contract was up which showed some intercommunication issues. They have followed up with some job leads since leaving the company.
good,"A typical day at work would be fairly simply and straight forward. You would start your by clocking in going to your desk and check to see whats knew and what has changed. Then you would start your work after that first step and proceed to do your job with taking calls in a very professional manor, and you would also do this in a timely manor. Then about every two to two and a half hours you would take a break an then a lunch for an hour after you completed your first four hours. "
good,"Productive and fun workplace , managers  were very helpful."
good,I had to work as well as I could to pick enough items at Amazon to meet their standards. I learned to use a scanner to pick Items. Management answered all of my questions. I only looked at my co-workers and had to go it alone to do my job. The hardest part of my job was meeting Amazon goals. The most enjoyable part of my job was my paycheck.
good,"If you're not bothered by working 10 hour shifts then it's a really spectacular job. The employees are great, the managers are easy to talk to and very helpful, and the work isn't difficult. Depending on what job you end up doing it can be long and tedious, but it's not hard money by any means."
good,I enjoyed working here.  I really enjoyed my co-workers because it seemed that everyone including the management seemed to have a real passion to assist Amazon's customers.  I really felt that the associates that I worked around had the same passion and drive to make the warehouse effective and also a fun place to work.
good,"good place to grow as a professional worker. depending on where you work, some days are busy, other days are slow. management is fair and always looking out for your best interest. co workers are ehhhh, but everybody is helpful when they need to be"

good,"I worked 4 10 hour days,  standing on  my feet and process product so customers can get there  credits  on there return policies.  And some of the time i was in unload lifting heavy boxes.  Typical day of processing consist of doing morning stretch to wake up the muscles in body,check the station to see you have everything to do your job, upload all the programs on the  computer check for damage and possible defects on the product,  makes sure all the items in one box is processed so the customer can there credit on there return."
good,Typical work day was 10 to 12 hour shifts and I learned how to manage time. The management staff was great and so were my co-workers. The hardest part about the job was dealing with fact that I couldn't feel my feet at the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part was learning.
good,There is no limit to what you can do and become at amazon. Long as you got the will and the drive Amazon is a great place
good,"Amazon was a good company and did treat the employees good. Fun place to work at most of the time. I learn more computer skills and how to give customer more information. Most of the time you did not get time to meet with co workers because Amazon is a fast paste work place. Hardest part of the job is keeping your numbers down because you are work so hard to make sure the customer is happy when they get off the phone. Amazon have all different kinds of stuff they do for the employees. they have picnics, games and luncheons."
good,"management is great..enjoy the work atmosphere. i learned a lot from this company.hard work, dedication.all co-workers are very helpfull. hardest part was to reach the productivity target.."

Being into HR team and an active member of funsters ( Team building Group activities) we enjoyed work.

good,"You're assigned your own internal company profile known most easily through your ""login."", Each person is offered your own headset, and your own cubicle. Co-workers are almost always eager to help one another, and management focuses on how they can best help their employees needs be met, and assist their employees to excel in their positions and grow to meet their goals. I was able to learn about people from all around the world and while some people saw the job as attached to a monotonous desk position, they were only lacking experience in the variety of ways to handle responsibilities, because you never know what challenges customers will ask you about, and there are always new ways to be creative when problem solving. Amazon offers a high moral environment, which is extremely necessary, as the job is fast past and continually changing, it requires those that work there to be patient and flexible while handling high stress situations."
good,"Great Company to work, the work culture in amazon is awesome - which makes to stay there for long time."
good,"I have been with the company for a few years now. As any job it has its ups and downs. I have seen managers come and go. Lately they have been acting upon employee concerns and people skills. During peak, it is always a mad house. I have learned so much in the field I am in. I would always recommend this if you have trades skills or a degree in a position. As far as the warehouse labor, it is a lot of walking and always have to worry about rate."

Although it would be some days where they would give out awards to those doing the best so it would give a reason for the workers to really push their selves.

If you're lucky enough to become a permanent member of staff, managers quickly identify your strengths and push you to use them as they prefer to promote in-house and want you to do well and advance through the company.

good,"A typical day at work there is so many options to do there, there is a large diversity of worl to do there you never get bored.  We 1st all start at sand up which is where we all gather together before the shift starts and we stretch and talk about how the day should be going and then we clap it out and chant to something and then we start our work"
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is discovering new products from whole foods. A typical day at work is clocking in, grab an iPhone and a shopping cart, fill the shopping cart with paper bags and fill up orders."
good,Managers they are understanding and if I have questions they always take the time with answers. HR is the best they answered  (my thought was crazy) but asked anyway and they understood without making me feel like it was dumb. All in all I enjoy working for Amazon
good,"learning new things and keep me going to have improve my skills everyday. "
good,great company to work for great benefits have a great chance at advancing in the company. Would recommend amazon for anyone. If you love working hard come here and advance.

good,I do not have any complaints about my job. I continue grow and learn each day. I have managers who are willing to help me grow. Your job is what you make of it.
good,As working as a Ada driver for Amazon I have learned that it is sometimes difficult to manage routes. Sometimes you would have to look in your itinerary to plan your routes accordingly for the time that you work.
good,Before you get hired you can pick the hours and days you want to work it's a fast-paced job the pay is pretty good and you are pretty much Your Own Boss when you are on the road
good,Great opportunity for advancement nice people great environment to work for and great hours Great communication with employees great awareness of safety great benefits
good,"It's awesome, some people say you don't get paid enough because they make so much money but a salary is dictated upon the difficulty of the problems you solve and stacking boxes on pallets isnt very difficult. 10/10, best warehouse gig you can find."
good,Seasonal job that gave me warehouse experience overall not a bad job. Some heavy lifting here and there plus a lot of walking. usually just worked 5 days a week for only 5 hours since it was part time.
good,"Great work life balance, room to grow, non stressful, free work out, Fair Leadership, Clean work environment, flexible shifts, at times it can be physically exhausting, important to stay hydrated, this job is like a free gym work out, could use utilize people more for coaching purposes"
good,Great employer who places the Customer Experience (CE) first and foremost.  Career advancement is most definitely available for those employees who put forth the effort and truly want to become part of a winning team.
good,Good environment to start a career for anyone or else to establish a career for mid-level employee. No dress restrictions.Flexible timings and good salary and incentives.
good,"- fun environment"
good,"Great place to start working, especially If you are currently waiting for another position/job opportunity to open up at another company. Most of all the employees are super cool/helpful. Fun place to work, time goes by fast. So far no complaints, other than the fact that the base pay is 15/hour. Working in Central Valley versus East Bay, you will definitely be taking a pay cut, but that's expected. But the best thing about being employed with Amazon is that I'm stress free. "
good,The people there are great and like a family. It's great getting to be a part of something like the team at Oak4. Lots of different departments to work in.
good,"Basicly it's a good position for students who want to get a full-time SDE position. It helps you become a good engineer and provides a good salary. The Culture and management are fine, too."
good,During the job some days would be worse than other however working as a team made us get the job done and that was the biggest accomplishments that we did when I work there and that was working as a team.
good,The only issue I had with working from home with Amazon is adjusting to their time zone. They have a excellent benefits package and the job culture is awesome! I loved it but unfortunately I had find another job in my time zone so my life would flow smoothly. Once my kids are older and don't need so much of my attention I definitely plan to reapply!
good,"I was given the chance to learn a lot about Amazon's Alexa devices and tablets while also learning how to organize the books within the store and maintain a clean, organized, and safe environment."
good,I just started so I don't have much to say about this job at the moment. So far the new hire event and orientation went well. They go into good details about the job.
good,"With competitive and reasonable starting pay, this job is idea for a recent high school graduate. The competition, bonuses, company dinners, and ability to make friends are all pros, aswell."
good,I was just a software engineering intern but it was a great place to be. The people I worked with were great and very helpful. Most people really wanted to help me improve and learn more about software.
good,"While working at Amazon, I was promoted from a Level 1 warehouse associate position to a Level 3 corporate position within a year of working with the company."
good,"I enjoyed my time I worked at Amazon. It was a very organized working environment. I really had a good relationship with my bosses. Also, I liked the people I worked with. The reason I left amazon was because I joined the CT Army National Guard and I needed to get in shape for Basic Combat Training and Combat Medic Training. Now that I fully trained and go part-time to drills, I would gladly work for Amazon again."
good,"Simple getting in, get your task given right from the beginning. You have a 15 minute break that you don't have to clock out for and you get to play on the PS4 or just be on your phone while you eat something from their little store."
good,"Great environment, great energy, benefits, paid time off and unpaid time. During peek season you get a chance to win cool prizes including more paid time off."
good,"I had heard a lot about Amazon and my mother had worked there before I did. I enjoyed it a lot. It was fast paced and you were always moving around. I like to think of it as getting paid to work out because you are lifting, squatting, walking and going up and down steps constantly. It is very physically demanding but they always push for safety and taking breaks so you don't over work yourself."
good,"Working as a Delivery Driver for Amazon is really busy, competitive, fast-paced, both hard and easy when working in the heat, best way to keep yourself motivated is listening to variety of music, or your favorite things that matter to you to get you through the day. "
good,You would start the day by loading your van in a specific order. Check your itinerary to see where you will be delivering. From there it's just you and the dispatcher as you make your deliveries.
good,"Amazon was a fast past work environment. Easy to learn machines and skills it would make a great first job for young adults entering the work force. Heat start wages, with flexible hours."
good,Excellent team environment with amazing benefits and opportunity for advancement.  The only drawback is that it is very difficult to excel to management without a bachelors degree and prior management experience seems to carry no weight.
good,"I enjoyed working in my most recent job as I used to work long hours, but the time goes quickly."
good,Amazon is the best place to work. They have amazing benefits and amazing opportunities. This is a place to grow and learn and I recommend the job to everyone I know.

good,Great Place to work although its very hard work but great pay. it will take up alot of your time but it's very worth though not to many places willing to give you what amazon will give you.
good,"I spend most of the timing in learning. Amazon gives a platform to learn ourself and deliver results, it's an customer obbession company. Hardest job to do is to recocile VAT return with GL transactions and to resolve issues."
good,I would be so happy if I could work for them again I had such a great time although I barely knew ppl bc it was in Columbia South Carolina but it was great
good,This was something I could do in my sleep. The reason for leave on the job was due to hurricane Irma. I relocated states and every since then I have been looking for similar work
good,I’ve worked at two different locations with Amazon. One thing that was the same at both sites was the management team. They both made coming to work enjoyable by showing genuine care and concern for the well-being of the associates. Games were used to help boost morale and productivity within the company which really made it a great place to work.
good,All the job description given by the management was fully done by me and I myself get involved with all the staff and management and work honestly and perfection
good,It’s a great paying job but if they would offer full time positions it would be a lot better. The staff are friendly too but the management is poor. But other than that it’s the ideal work environment
good,"I joined in Amazon as an intern,I received a lot of guidance from my mentor and manager. They helped me to know what exactly is suitable for me despite daily working content."
good,"Potential Growth in all areas "
good,"Is a good work area, and they supply all the thing that we need to work comfortable. I recomended to all my friends work in amazon, if you want to have a good experience apply."
good,"I started at Amazon in June of 2018 and after a few weeks figuring out the company and getting to know my coworkers, I grew to greatly enjoy working here. I worked hard, and had plenty of opportunity for overtime, and was able to learn a lot from those I worked with on a daily basis."
good,"I am an Amazon Driver, I do the deliveries on Amazon Flex, Amazon Prime Now and Whole Foods. Everything is through an app in my phone. "
good,"Good place to work - continuous change and improvement, good benefits, management a bit of a roller coaster system, job security is good. calm worplace with less stress"
good,The great thing is they HIRE literally anyone like literally ex cons ppl with felonies ppl who have no experience. It’s very easy to get hired if you’re smart enough you will take advantage and there def so much room for growth I this job is preferable for someone who looking to make fast easy money it’s long hours and from 10-12 hrs a day
good,Great company to work with. The work isn't hard at all. They provide great benefits just like any other job. Highly recommend working for this company to others out there searching.
good,"I loved being at Amazon. I think the culture there is great, but the upper management could use a little work. Contrary to popular belief, the company does care about its' employees and has a lot of measures in place to do as such. However, many employees do not take advantage of the resources made available to them through the company. "
good,"Great company! Great benefits, great structure and just a great environment it’s like the military in the set you work in but it’s easy for the willing!"
good,N/a it really was nothing i loved working there every one was on point and everything was really good an the management was great an real open with us
good,"I would work for them again and again I love the seasonal opportunities, I look forward to working with Amazon again, this would be my third season. I worked as many overtime as I could and one of my highlights was speaking with my customers and helping solve some of there issues. I have definitely recommended this company to others, it’s a pleasure."
good,"Its not everyone!!!"
good,No interview- just fill out forms .  Well managed.  Need better computer software to not try to deliver a package after business or secure apartment is closed.
good,"Job its easy, target easy to make, managment nice and funny, ten hours of work daily two breaks half hour one paid, shift look like 4 days on 3 days off"
good,"One of the best organisations that is employee friendly and takes utmost care to keep their employees encouraged, happy and less pressurized. Amazon lives upto their work motto of ""Work hard, have fun and make history"""
good,Perfect work life balance.Nice environment and managers who will keep you positive and motivated.Nice placecto start with amazing colleagues to help you.
good,"They make you feel at home , long hours but it goes by fast."
good,Loved my internship. Lots of fun. Everybody is very busy and you need to figure stuff out on your own. Projects you work on have real application. Loved it.
good,I love working in amazon met loads of amazing people done a few jobs picking/ packing/stowing  the jobs are pretty easy when you get used to doing them.
good,"The only part I could not handle was the physical part daily, however, a young person would be fine at it. I did my job well for almost 2yrs before my body started breaking down. If I could have stayed I would have stayed. But I just got tired of my body hurting ALL THE TIME. Otherwise I have nothing but praises for the company, staff, and benefits overall...i did enjoy my time therr"
good,"I’m a Prime Whole Foods Shopper and love the job. I do work at a brand new, beautiful store which certainly helps. It can get a little stressful when there are more orders than people or when I can’t get hours, but it’s a great part time gig."
good,"Lets say you work 40 hours / week. You're expected to put x number of items into boxes, let's say that number is 40. So 40 x 40 = 1600. A coworker literally put 1599 items into boxes during that week. 1599 is below their threshold & considered a bad week. 4 or 5 bad weeks & you're laid off."
good,Buen trabajo pero largas horas de trabajo entre 12 y 14 horas
good,"Amazon offers training in all fields offered at their warehouses and good benefits. Vacation time,stock options,profit sharing,health coverage promotions"
good,"Nice place to work, I like the paid time off and the overtime. Also nice environment. Good job placement to climb up in the company for those who want to expand in the company"
good,"For me, a typical day would be coming in, stretching and getting to my work station as fast as possible to get logged and set up. Once i'm set up, I check to make sure that I have everything that I need. I learned how to be even more of a leader while woking for amazon. Workplace culture is is built on safety and fun while working at a fast pace. The hardest part about the job is keeping a high level of energy while working the over night shift. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers"
good,"Amazon is one of the best organizations to be associated with."
good,Every day is challenging as there are so many dynamic changes in the regular process. Decision making plays a critical aspect while handling customers

good,stric on upt hours otherwise great working place i wasn't planning to leave work the only reason im leaving for is my manager is giving me hard time that's all
good,"Great place to work! Shifts were 4 hours long, and I could pick up as many extra shifts as I wanted. Seasonal employees had to take a shuttle to the main building so I couldn't go home during the 1.5 - 2 hours between shifts. Was just too long of a wait!"
good,"It takes hard work to succeed at Amazon, It’s your choice.  Fast ten hour days.  You will know quickly if it’s a good fit.  You’ll either love it or hate it.  Give it a shot! Nothing to lose!"
good,"Buenos beneficios, numerosas actividades durante todo el año."
good,One of the best jobs I’ve had. Never a dull moment everyone working there is a team player and you meet a lot of people also the work duties where great always something new to learn and different jobs tasks to do. Only someone who doesn’t like actually working wouldn’t like working here

good,"I have worked at 2 sites and I can say while they are both completely different, Amazon is an awesome opportunity. Amazon make your safety a priority.  They value your time and compensate you accordingly."
good,It was great working there. My only complaint is that due to my seasonal position I had difficulty finding work sometimes. Great place regardless. Just try to be there and don 't slack off. You'll be good.

good,"It was fun, fast paced, and all around a good place to work.the people were friendly and were always very helpful we had a long lunch time and even had breaks."
good,"Would recommend if you need a part time job. Casual environment but you stay busy. Picks up during seasonal hours so it can get crowded.  It's a warehouse so you still need to work in/out of the warehouse regardless of the weather; It can get cold, rained on working outside or very hot. However,  they provide rain coats, water or bring your own, you dress or bring your own clothes for the weather and they go over safety as their #1 priority."

The atmosphere is nice and easy going as long as you get your job done with mininal errors. Pay is decent for the job as it is very easy. Theres competitions which reward top placing competitors.

good,nice place to work.some of the management are real friendly.nice and clean area.fast pace some of the workers are really really nice and they take the time to help you when needed.

good,"I wish they had full time delivery drivers at Amazon and didn’t outsource the position. The management has been great to me.

good,"One of the largest firms globally to work for."
good,"Worked four 10-hour days, with three days off. Overtime, if there is any, is a scheduled day, and you know in advance if there will be any. The work is hard, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time there."

good,Amazon was a great place to work.I really enjoyed my time there. It was a great learning experience it definitely help me prepare for future jobs I recommend this job to anyone.
good,the work is physically hard on your body but worth it. lots of little perks. great comradery amongst workers. manager mike is very approachable. good job but be prepared to work
good,"The only issue I have ever had was due to the technology that they use. Their app needs to be updated for route mapping. Otherwise it is a  very ""Team Oriented"" environment."
good,"Amazon is a good job to have. Very flexible with work schedules. Management is okay, but some night sort floor managers do not know how to speak to employees."
good,"I love my job wish the seasonal position was longer its was easy to learn how to scan package, A very fast pace, and the worker was friendly easy to work within."
good,"Amazon was really a fun place to work. Had an opportunity to learn a lot about handling customers all over USA and China. Managed teams and so could learn about leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people all over India, and also a very cool workplace culture where you can speak whenever and whatever you feel is not correct."
good,"Many opportunities to develop and grow. Promotion is always a motivation, but need to show value as well."
good,I loved the job.It was fast paced but it was a great job and fun to do.Cpt was big  getting items out on time. There was always a give away or fun waiting in the break room!
good,"This was a part time job. Fun, fast paced environment in a warehouse facility. Management was solid, and the ambassadors were present to help streamline and coach the associates and communicate knowledge and information back and forth the management and associates. Continuous efforts are made to improve and streamline the process of sorting packages and getting them to destination on a daily basis."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. They take their time to train you properly when you are hired. They arent really strict when it comes to what you wear as long as you wear appropriate attire, so no long necklaces or hanging jewelry."
good,"Working at Amazon is a wonderful experience with lots of scope with employee to work with freedom and on their own creativity & decision making."
good,"J'ai passer deux mois chez AMAZON, et personnellement c'est une très bonne expérience. Je pourrais y retourner sans hésiter."
good,"Good place to work fun, fast paced, high volume work load. Good management, great co-workers. Multiple oppurtunities to advance and move up while constantly learning something new."
good,Era una empresa de ventas por internet con buenas prestaciones y motivación al empleado
good,I worked for Amazon a few times and left due to how far I was located from the company. They provide good training and feedback daily/weekly. I would work for them again.
good,"Amazon offers great compensation packages and really is a wonderful environment to work in.  It's been my experience within Customer Service that every opportunity is given to all of our employees to make a career for themselves and improve.  Lots of time off options available, and I've never seen a company be so willing to compromise with their employees with one off attendance situations."
good,I like the money and environment I like meeting goals and expectations I didn't like the 2 30 minute breaks I liked we had locker and fridge for food and I like no steel toed boots
good,It's very busy in the beginning but after the hard part is out of the way it gets very dull but when you're working you Work! It seems like with management they did what they could because the company itself is very busy. However there were a lot of times when they just blindly followed orders even if they didn't know what they were actually told to do. In addition in my experience and from what I saw some people got promotions when they didn't know how to do the work they were put in charge of.
good,I deliver packages to business's and homes. Just have to watch your surroundings while on the streets. Other than that I like working with Amazon. Would definitely bring others aboard.
good,Overall a great job and a great place to work. The pay was good as well as the overtime pay was about $1.50 extra. We had break time as well as time to go to the bathroom.
good,"J'ai travaillé chez Amazon (Plus d'un an)"
good,"I like working at amazon , they just needs to make the breaks longer. My manager is a great women. I never heard abt bad thing about any of the managers. I understand they have to do they job but most of the time they work us too much."
good,They work with you in all aspects the only reason I'm leaving is because I had a baby and I need a at home job. The only thing is you have to be willing to work and follow rules or you will be fired like any other job
good,Amazon was exciting however there was tons of work to be done very competitive company. I enjoyed winning prizes and maintaining my rate to keep out of getting written up. was tons of work always and the breaks were quick.
good,"I’ve been working at amazon for a bout 3 weeks now and I love everything about it. You get rewarded for improving. I won a 10$ gas gift card & a 5$ Starbucks card which was pretty cool. The managers are great, the training was good. Everyone helps each other out. But I honestly think this job is meant for younger folks, only because you’re on your feet 10+ hours a day with the exception of lunch breaks.  Youre pretty much a robot . I work from 6:30 pm to 5:00 am , Personally it’s perfect for me because I’m a night owl. You don’t have time to think about personal problems, as a picker. You need to meet a certain goal and that’s all that should matter to you as soon as you walk in. When I was trained, the first thing she told me was that they care about your numbers only. To the company, you are just a number. As long as you’re okay with that then you’ll be fine. Pay is good. Benefits are good. It’s a lot of physical work but for 15$/hr , I’ll take it."
good,"I spent 17 years with Amazon in various Supply Chain, Operations & Finance related Process Engineering & Leadership roles, mostly focused on launching new operations and delivering process standards & cost structure improvements for Amazon’s fulfillment center network. "
good,Amazon is one of the best companys to work for aside from some of the management.  Benefits start day 1. Orientation is great you get a badge made but they take it but you get it back your first day of work. The discounts are great. Places like AT&T Mobile.Verison mobile. Sketchers shoe store. And many more. The CEO Jeff is awesome to work for.
good,This is my second time to do seasonal help here for the holidays. It is hard labor but everyone around you is helpful to get the packages out to our customers in time before Christmas. :)
good,i loved the job and the hours and the environment laid back and something to get use to and easy to move to another department in less than 90 days the management is well put together some what
good,"I drove a forklift, so it was definitely fast paced. I learned how to operate a center rider forklift and how to sort the products that come from other countries and send them to outbound to go to the customers. Management was understanding and fair. I especially like the diversity of the warehouse which consisted of people from different cultures and ethnic backgrounds. Honestly, there wasn't anything hard about this job; just pay attention to your surroundings and be safe. The most enjoyable part of this job is motivating my co-workers and creating a fun and enjoyable environment."
good,"I likes working for Amazon, and enjoyed the job performance there.   a great place to works if you can picks up shifts. I works with I phone receiving orders from Whole Food customers.   I go shops for the items that they order. Bagged them, staged them and gets them ready for deliver."
good,It's pretty awesome they have several break rooms on each floor 10 hour shifts get 2 breaks 12 hour get 3 breaks most of the management is amazing hr is super understanding and always tries there best to help
good,"I learned how to deal with work related situations and find solutions to all problems. "
good,I would say the company is probably one of the best jobs i have ever been apart of. They make you feel like they value every single employee everyday.
good,"The Kobe was okay, day one benefits, PTO, and great training. The only draw back is if you don’t catch on to things fast, you could struggle. Somewhat of a fun atmosphere but it’s still a job at the end of the day."
good,"Your typical day at Amazon starts with your company and co-workers gathered up . Your dispatchers update you on the latest with Amazon systems and Warehouse movements . After your meeting, you are give a GPS system with the route you have to pick up . Then you head out to make your deliveries . I've learned how to adapt to any setting quickly from doing big routes to delivery on rainy days and most important system updates that are constantly happening at Amazon . Amazon management is the best . they're willing to help with any problem or concerns . They complete the task at hand and much more . the work culture is awesome . I don't find anything hard at Amazon myself . The most enjoyable part of my job is the communication skills I have with amazon and their customers ."
good,I had very good experience working with Amazon. The management is very supportive and   amazon creates a platform where we can have fun while working.
good,"It is a very productive and a good place to work. My qualification is Ph.D., and it will not be helpful much for the company. They kept me at the bottom level as an Associate. I like to be a hard working person. I know HP load Runner, QTP (Flight applications), Manual and Selenium testing (Core Java, Test NG). Therefore I like to quit which helps me to do better."
good,"I had a great time working at amazon . it had great benefits, everyone was helpful and knew how to keep morale high especially during high stress days such as prime week and peak season. The hardest part of the job was when it got too hot in the ware house, stops for water was very important on the work floor. Another hard part was if lighting struck too close to the warehouse work slowed down exponentially and the work day was increased. By an hour and a half."
good,"Simple jobs work fast be accurate learn every aspect of the operation "
good,I worked at Amazon Music as an intern and the culture in the San Francisco office is really great. Manager is nice and coworkers are super helpful. I feel that I improve a lot during the internship.
good,"I enjoyed working there, great atmosphere and you meet all kinds of people there. You learn allot of new things and gain much experience. Very fun job!"
good,"Never had a problem working the seasonal positions. They are accommodating, safe, employees are very easy to work with and a great company to work for."
good,More benefits within the company should be there being as though the company is so huge . Although all in all I really enjoyed working with the management team .
good,Amazon is my first company and I loved the work environment here. They follow bio metrics which helps in understanding the exact work timings of an employee. They have cab facility which is delightful for an employee because not every company provides this facility.
good,running food serving food and making sure customers are happy with their meals and do check backs and preps. clean tables and looking like it stranded
good,"I am feeling great to work in Amazon. I had learnt much more as my education background."
good,"Amazon offered me a lot of development opportunities, but getting promoted is usually hard as they only have a few positions available.  The work environment and management is amazing, and you can definitely learn a lot working here."
good,Nice place to work. The work culture is good. No pressure working over here. The best part is coming to work everyday knowing that you need to complete a job without any pressure.
good,"good people and good work area would like to do it again!"
good,"I loved going to work, always meeting new people, and receiving benefits though I was part time. They always gave you the tools to perform your job, such as box cutters, vests, gloves, ear plugs."
good,"Started at Amazon beginning of Sep! Got moved on day 2 and now an Instructor! Very fast pace but like any company,management are friendly approachable and just normal human beings! Would definitely recommend Amazon to work for!"
good,Overall a great starting job with great perks and people to work with. Can be overwhelming at times but overall good. Company pays well and provides good benefits to their associates. 4 day on and 3 day off is Great!
good,I would go back and would recommend employment to everyone. The problem I had was with a one person in upper management and I cost me my job the job that I loved.
good,"I have been part of this company for 5 years now and never regretted it.  Like any large company there are hard times but work life balance is encouraged.  What I appreciate most is the flexibility to get work done.  Large project is given, the PM is typically given flexibility to get it done as they see fit."
good,"tires you out from standing, but in general, it is an easy job to complete with great benefits and usually a stable position in order to get used to doing the job a certain way. its a good environment for you to meet different people and advance depending on work ethic. Line leaders and high powers do communicate well and assist in whatever you may be struggling with."
good,"Ability to own your role. I’ve never worked somewhere that provides so many resources to employees to do their job and trusts them to do it in their own creative way. You want to wear sweatpants to work and a t-shirt? No problem, Amazon wants you to be comfortable. Your team supports you and you aren’t competing with each other, you’re being the best at your job you can be while supporting each other."
good,The work of picking is good but i feel they should give more time for you to get your speed of picking where they want it . other then that it fun . Also why do they only hire picking or packing . They don't let you apply for anything else unless you've been there a long time.
good,The place was clean work friendly great team work good benefits and excellent management. I worked as a.picker and a packet and sometimes I loaded trucks I worked in multiple positions.
good,you clock in and go too stand up do your stretches after that they tell you your job duties for the day and the velum for that working day after you go too the doors and loud up the trailers
good,was an energetic place to work and very demanding.the managment was young so wasnt quite okay they were more worried about other things than managing their crew.
good,"Amazon is challenging but in a good way. It keeps you on your toes as things will change in a heartbeat. Start each day as if it is Day1,be focused, know your goals and find innovative ways to execute the goals."
good,Fun place to work but some mangers will make you want to pull your hair out. Other than that I would recommend working here to anyone especially during holiday season because you can easily get 60 hours per week plus time and a half.
good,"Amazon Fulfilment Center is a great job to work for, if you are use to warehouse jobs. I work at the CMH1 location and I have no problem working at this location it’s worth the pay that you get paid. Great management and PA’s make it worth working."
good,"I've been here for almost a year now, and I can tell that Amazon is a great place to work. "
good,It is a great company to work for where every employee is given equal importance. Amazon encourages the employee and employer in training and development along with work.
good,"Clock in at time clock.Go to stand up where we proceed to stretch and get ready for our day.The warehouse is very big with many departments.We  start:high volume performance,rated time picking,prepping andpacking specialist,freight line receving and processing associate.{Organized multi-task/problem solver/trouble shooter/atec is a machine that  measurements all new products comming in from vender for amazon website.They like to cross train employer so they no all departments.....A half hour for lunch ,two 15min breaks,all employees do 10 hour shifts clock out 5.30 Pm"
good,"Depuis mon entrée chez Amazon, j'ai été rapidement formé sur plusieurs postes ce qui permet une alternance des tâches non négligeable sur des amplitudes horaires telles que celles du week-end."
good,"The Work culture is amazing.Work hard ,have fun ,make history is the motto of this company and they really follow it.Good salary and relaxed atmosphere to work."
good,I feel comfortable and satisfied with my job I love my job because everyone shares same vision and I have a great degree of control and freedom with in my job
good,"Good environment for anyone that wants to come in and work,great staff and management,  i learned that no matter where somebody is from we all have the same goal in mind"
good,"I loved my job at Amazon. This job is very fast paced and I believe challenging. You are recognized if you are able to work above the rates for various jobs. I learned how to train others, and how to run and maintain machinery."
good,Amazon is a great place to be employed with. They give out gift cards and they also have fun with their employees.  The pay is awesome. The hours are long but it’s worth it.
good,I love the get things done environment if you have a great idea and want to see it turn into a product or program...this is where that happens (as long as it is aligned with the organizations mission).
good,Busy atmosphere with lots to do.  Good team work.  Management strives to make all associates happy and well compensated.  Great benefits package.  Happy atmosphere
good,"I loved working here, it was relaxed but productively paced. The lunch room was amazing with all their fridges and arcade games. It was also fun order picking and seeing all the different things they had in there. The warehouse is kind of like a huge, disorganized library. 10/10 would recommend"
good,"Excellent workplace and culture wherein one can work and have fun at the same time."
good,The Lebanon plant is an Awesome place to work. I work nights and the management is great ! You do have a quota to meet but they try to help you every way they can to help you succeed.
good,I enjoyed working at Amazon. The culture and environment is very inclusive. I worked the overnight shift which eventually did not pair well with my life outside of work. That is the only reason I left. Amazon does a good job of taking care of its employees.
good,you will work a lot. Especially if you are salaried. expect to be called on the weekends. You don't spend enough time at home. You are part of something great. I thoroughly enjoy amazon.
good,Atmosphere and recognition is amazing there. One of my favourite places I worked at. Growth in the company is almost a guarantee. Training is provided for all jobs and regularly
good,"I worked at amazon for around 7 years. I moves at a rapid place. Once you work for amazon you get an overall development in terms of people skills, project management & carrier enhancement overall."
good,Amazon was a really fun laid back job the work wasnt hard at all the people where always friendly the hr reps never got out of line and their overall worker appreciation was over the top
good,I like Amazon.. If I can still work there after relocating then I would and yes I would most definitely recommend this job to anyone that just want to work part time and just do something that is just laid back.. I can say that they do have a lot of this to offer if u stay  there long...
good,It Was Great Working For Amazon. The Environment Was Fast Paced And Very Productive. The Managers And Staff Were Friendly And Super Understanding. It Was Overall An Amazing Experience.
good,"My experience has been that as long as you focused on the work required of you and did not goof off, that it was easily manageable and very rewarding."
good,The workforce was self-driven and the team members motivated each other to strive harder to provide quality service.The perks were great and so was an opportunity to learn new things
good,Amazon is a great place to learn and develop your skills. Day by Day the company tries to improve its process to remove the burden of the employees. All the additional training helps to improve and be enthusiastic about the work.
good,"The job that i have there is very fast paced, you have a rate that you should be hitting every hour or two. A lot of the jobs are non stop moving and keeping a fast pace."
good,"It is a great place to work if you enjoy standing on your feet for long periods of time. It didn't have any air condition inside the warehouse, so you have to be able to adjust to the weather conditions"
good,Great place to work long hours at a fast pace. I recruited and placed Senior Managers to New Talent. Everyone pretty much agrees the work is hard but worth it at the end of the day.
good,"Great company grows prett fast  the give fair breaks the people will train and make you feel a period a family and not a job , overall it a great opportunity"
good,Overall it was a great place to work at. They had a great team of people that always encouraged to your best. I liked how they encouraged you to move into higher positions.
good,"Relaxed work environment (no pressure at all), great place to develop legal skills (lots of things to learn), intelligent and friendly people, supportive workmates"
good,Great  place to work it's very different you pack customer product all day long.Its very flexible you will work at different department. They would have you working on dock to load boxes on the truck.
good,Working for Amazon was a great learning experience in the warehouse fields. Exhausting at times but rewarding in the end. Great people and management always eiger to help when needed.
good,I think it was a good job and it was great working for them. I had night shift so I didnt have to be away from my children for too long when it came to them .
good,An easy job that pays decent money. Very easy going management with flexible schedules and it's a great place to work if your in school. If your hired full time through Amazon you instantly get all your benefits and stock options.
good,"A typical day working at Amazons Warehouse in Chicago was never to stressful i had morning shift so i would come in from 3:45 to 8 they will take your badge scan it and put your sticker on a board telling you what you will be working on first either your working on the dock putting loading packages or your on the floor scanning packages and loading them into bags after that everyone was recommended to do 2 ""routes"" before you can clock out for the day routes are just basically following a list of packed packages that someone filled by scanning boxes and putting them in bag its pretty common sense just make sure your looking at the numbers and letters because it can catch you're eye!"
good,"Enjoyed working there,  it was fast and rewarding."
good,Amazon is a fast placed work center when it comes to handling the products getting them scanned stacked and shipped. The learning team does a great job in preparing you for what you have in store working there
good,"We all know Amazon is a leader in the consumer industry for fast shipping and selection, but they also have the best training and management support of any call center I've worked for, especially for being from home."
good,The job was very demanding I had to pack and repack items according to shipping instructions. I learned how much Amazon ships in one day and how much effort it takes to operate the facility. The workplace was about moral they had a lot of contests for best performers to keep employees competing to be the best at there job. That would also be the best and most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Had to be punctual, follow safety guidelines, move from conveyor belt to conveyor belt as dictated by workload. Other employees were very pleasant to work with; very nice break room facility."
good,"i walk and deliver groceries to apartment and condo building thorough out midtown manhattan. The job is cool , i walk a mile and change a day. Just sucks when it rains lol"
good,"Great environment, people, care about their staff members and try to assist them in every way possible, they also have programs to assist them otherwise with families and more."
good,"Amazon has excellent ""foot in door"" opportunity.  Plenty of room to advance.  The benefit package is excellent and work life balance is excellent.  You start with a bank of time off to allow for family needs."
good,"Really flexible and fun company to work for. I started off working full time as a seasonal associate and was hired on full time afterwards.  I love this job because it works around my school schedule perfectly.  I know work as a reservist, I pretty much work when I want to but there is a a 4 hour minimum a week."
good,"It was a great place to work but management not as professional like it was supposed to be at that time that I was working there. I can""t say anything about right now."
good,I loved working at Amazon. They have good vibes all around. Pretty much stay busy but it makes the day move pretty quick. And my favorite they work with an hours system rather then a points system.
good,I learned how to pack at a fast speed. the most enjoyable part of the day was tryna race against my co workers to get the highest rate. I also enjoyed the work culture it was a safe fun enviornment
good,Amazon is set up to cater to associates financial and personal growth and development. There are a variety of opportunities that are available in house and training if you decide to want to try another field with a different business.
good,If a desk job isn't for you this is a place you would probably do great. Quick paced but pay is in the $13-$15 range for most their warehouses. Bonus pay possible during months leading up to black Friday and Christmas.
good,"I would be still working there today, had I not gotten ill, and at that time there were requirements that I had to have to return to work, that they thought were a safety issue. I no longer have those requirements, but it seems to be an issue with them"
good,I love working for this company. Everyone I work with are amazing people.  The hours are long but how they divide the breaks makes the day go faster. There is alot of benefits working for this company
good,Amazon is a great company to work for. There are many career opportunities with supervisors and managers that will assist you along the way. They strive for success.
good,"bel posto di lavoro, tipica giornata di lavoro : si iniziava con un briefing e poi classiche cose da magazziniere"
good,"Management was Good Team Players"
good,"its clean and everyone is happy to work there. Management is always available to talk to if a problem arises. It was great to wear casual clothes, with the benefit of having A/C the building was never hot or humid so it was very comfortable."
good,"I had fun working Amazon, there were prize giveaways during the holidays when you work long hours. Amazon is built up of teams and there are lots of power hours where teams compete against each other.  As well as on your own team you compete with each other for prizes. It makes the day go by faster and its lots of fun."
good,"Unique environment, fast paced, always changing, managers have their favorites, chances for advancement is far and few between but there.  Alot of standing and walking."
good,"My time at Amazon started as a QA analyst, but I was quickly able to expand into the role that suits me far better, a Project Manager.  Not only was applauded for my initiative, I was encouraged and fully supported by my managers. They never micromanaged either, as I was given full autonomy, meaning trust was placed in my abilities like no other company has done.  "
good,i worked there 5 days a week from 9am to 2pm great place to work and i loved to work there again.it was a fast paced environment place meet new people learn new stuff
good,worked on running machine to make sure products got out on a timely fashion and that they were all in great condition for the customers to receive. pulled oreders

good,"This is a very  fast paced job, But I love this job and I recommend it to everyone off all races and age.. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊"
good,"Amazon is a great place to work at because you get to meet new people and I love to interact with people. My role at Amazon was temporary which is why I had to leave, I Want to work there permanently so I can help my dad pay his bills."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you're willing to put in the time necessary to advance.  The starting salary can be fairly low which can make this difficult or impossible, but otherwise it's a great company with very caring mangers and fellow employees."
good,"The hardest part was the frequent change in shifts, and late night shifts."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"Pays well, Good job if you like to work hard, it's just like getting paid to go to the gym. Have multiple break rooms, supply you with vests and gloves and safety glasses."
good,I’d definitely work for again very likely to get trained when new my only complaint is if you don’t get trained later I was one of the many first employees and was told that I’d get trained before new hires but I apply for a new training and till the time I left I had not heard about the training
good,The workplace at Amazon is really loud and crowded. Everything is fast paced and you are timed on how many boxes or products you can send down the line.
good,"You are moving and standing for 10 hours a day, can be busy at times and sometimes slow. Co-workers are friendly and helpful when it gets busy, Management is approachable if you need to ask questions."
good,"It was great to work from my own home, the over time is available for any one to pick up extra hours as well as request time off by giving away  your hours. I liked this job alot. I left because there a shift bid between 1000+ employees, and i ended up with a shift i just couldn't accommodate."
good,"Only problem is I'ma temp employee and my contract, even though extended to the legal max is ending. If I was a real Amazonian, I would have been salaried, gotten benefits, holidays, but I'm a temp contractor, so I am technically a self contractor and get no benefits, no paid time off, etc"
good,Good place to work if you are full of energy and motivated.  It was an enjoyable job.  The pay was not enough for what I needed cost of living wise or I would have stayed longer.
good,"Wonderful fast paced job that was oriented on customer service. Great place that is team oriented to get the customer a positive experience with the company,"
good,Safety was the primary focus and the hardest part to maintain as
good,"We always had a fun at work along with the targets regarding the productive work, I have learnt many things from Amazon as it was my first company to work in.Staff always create healthy environment in work to make us have good rapport between managers and leads. "
good,"Work at Amazon is hectic at first, but once you get the hang of things it becomes second nature."
good,"It’s tough but worthy job , the management are helpful and all you have to do is work hard I’ve been in Amazon about 1/15 years now and I enjoyed the benefits"
good,Working with Amazon was a pretty great experience. Most of my duties were on the warehouse floor pulling packages off conveyor  belts or stacking packages in their designated areas. The goal each and every day was to receive a set amount of packages and stack them all away so that the next shift can load them onto trucks and ship them out. The main frustration of my day was that the scanning devices we were given would glitch out here and there and it would require me to go back on a package and re-scan it which would waste time. But overall it was a great experience because we all worked as a team to accomplish our goal for the day and no one was without help. The management was friendly at times but they got stern when they needed to. Most of the conversations I've had with management were pleasant and they would most of the time direct me to another part of the warehouse that was struggling with their load of work. Overall it was an experience that I would love that have again. I had to unfortunately leave because I was only a seasonal employee but if I had the chance to work with Amazon again I would.
good,the people i worked with made the place fun and enjoyable. the work isn't bad of course its not the most exciting job but its a decent job that isn't hard to do just tedious
good,"This is a great place to work. I use this as a side job along with my full time job. The hours are very convenient. The people, co-workers and managers, are great people to be around. They are knowledgeable to what they do."
good,"Fast paced work, can earn unpaid time in hours to store up and use whenever you can't  be at work. Overall a nice place to work. I would recommend to people who want to work extra hours at a good pay rate or students who need flexibility in schedules."
good,Amazon helps you as best as they can with whatever situation may pop up for you. They make sure you are always safely working within the fulfillment center and make sure everyone is always positive.
good,"No time for ridiculous conflicts or drama. the job is to the point and everyone is extremely respectful. there are a number of rules, however by communicating with managers the rules can be worked around when appropriate."
good,"Job was fine, 4 days a week, 10 hours a day. Well paid overtimes and night shift. Friendly and supportive colleagues. It is not hard, but need to be able to lift up to 15kg."
good,"Typical day started out with picking up you 3 hour to 5 hour blocks at he distribution center and setting up you route for the 1st half of the day.

good,Fun and great environment especially for your health. The pay was great I've enjoyed working there. The only dislike I didn't like was the constant walking. Over all it was great.
good,"Each day at Amazon each fulfillment associates job duty varies. Most of fulfillment associates are required to scan and place packages on pallets. Others work in inbound, which requires them to unload the delivery trucks. Fulfillment associates also work in non-con, they process larger packages that are too heavy to be on the lanes, problem solve repackages damaged products and those who work on the sort slide are required to sort packages to specific lanes. "
good,The work is not hard and people always willing to help... Great chances of advancement and you get to pick your own schedule. Great place to work..apply
good,"A typical day at work included scanning packages. I learned to work in a team environment. The hardest part of the job was to learn everything quickly and jump into the fast paced environment. Overall, everyone was friendly and the management was great."

good,This is the 1st place I’ve worked at in many years that the management actually set us up for success. There is absolutely no drama here!  The best place I’ve worked at in years!
good,This place is not an easy place to work at. It demand  a lot physically  . If you are looking for a job such as then it is a great job. Most of the time it is fast paced and time is an important factor. Management do their best and usually there is a lot good worker and you learn on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable part is that the company is growing at an alarming speed and change are made on a regular basis.
good,Fun place to work but very fast paced and very physically demanding. The hardest part of the job was standing most of the time and you don't get long breaks at all. Sometimes I felt I was doing slave work. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,Amazon Devolopment Centre is one of the best workplace to work for a fresher. There was  no dresscode and all the people who are working there were friendly.
good,The Job is great for anyone wanting extremely flexible hours where you can pick choose what days you want to work. Pay was acceptable for the work that was done. Management was friendly and welcoming .
good,A typical day at Amazon is like any other day at another job. WORK!! You work to make money. Working at Amazon was fun and exciting. i cant complain about the work or the company.
good,There is never a dull moment. Always working. High but achievable expectations. Room for advancement if your willing to work hard. Simple yet fulfilling work.

good,Dobra atmosfera w miejscu pracy. Wysoka kultura. Możliwość szybkiego rozwoju. Zawsze można liczyć na pomoc zarządu. Najprzyjemniejsza część pracy to kontakt z ludzmi. Pracę w tej firmie oceniam na bardzo interesującą.
good,"Long hours."

good,"Good balance job, working atmosphere, caring management, and staff."
good,"Work hard, Have Fun make History !!"
good,"Fun environment, very fast paced but manageable. wear comfortable clothes and shoes, you are on your feet the whole time. Be sure you stretch before every shift, it is tasking, and if you don't properly stretch, you can become stiff."
good,It is a good place to work if you are one that likes to work and work hard fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job is the constant standing and walking untill your used to ut. Management is ok and then pay is very good and coexist with the workload
good,"I love working with Amazon and would have stayed if i didn't get injured. A typical day was counting merchandise to make sure it was correct, not broken for customer purchases and accuracy for the website. Management was ok depending on the team you were on but was competitive because everyone wanted to be number one and win. Workplace culture was that everyone was cool and nice on your team and would help you because they wanted to win. The hardest part was the standing for 10 hrs a day and going from one part of the warehouse to another depending on your area for breaks and lunch but you had to clock back in on time or you were penalized. What I learned from Amazon is that a warehouse has to be a well oiled machine and everyone has to work or else the whole area can mess up one spot and your numbers drop. I loved the working on a team aspect but on your own and it was one of the best places I ever worked. I wish they were closer (drive wise) otherwise i would reapply."
good,Working from home with amazon was amazing.  In my position I was able to choose my own hours and work when it was convienient.  Plenty of support to get you started as well.
good,Great Company to work for but there is no room for advancement or development at the Warehouse level. A typical included packing customer orders and any other task the manager might ask of me. My Manager was awesome and the hardest part of the job was the constant repetition. The work doesn't change its the same day after day.
good,"From day one everyone there was so nice. It felt welcoming, the work was a decent amount of physical work. I loved my job, I loved my co workers. The day I left I cried, it was a hard decision to leave but I had to for my family. My managers were great, the best I ever had.  The stocks are worth it, they pay for school, from day one you have insurance. Time and a half for holidays if you work them. They always give treats and prizes. Great place to work, I would work there again."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for, there are many opportunities for job advancement, and they offer you extra hours aside from the ones you already work."
good,"Overall, I loved working for Amazon, and meeting new people with different backrounds/ lifestyles and just getting to work with positive smart working people. Great place to work!!"
good,Very Nice Place To Work.But You Need To Change One Law.That Points thing.It's unfair not good at all.People could get in accident by rushing to get at work.if you get there late.like a little late.they take out points from you.after 5 or 6 Points.they send you home.or If You sick.call sick for couple days.really sick.after certain days.they send you home.as ya call dismiss.fired.that need to change.take that points thing out the systems.
good,Good job as a seasonal worker. My leader was helpful and the team as a whole was awesome!! The chatroom was really helpful when confused on how to do anything.
good,"Its good company no any bais culture,2 weekly off in week very good management team good HR basically Transport department no salary Issue good leave police."
good,great working environment and fun people to be around. very fast paced so there is always something to do and the managers are amazing. just great working experience.
good,"Going to work is convenient and a breeze. My schedule was Thur- Sat from 6:00p-6:30a. Overtime days included Sundays and Mondays same hours. It's a great side job or career move, if you want to move up in a company. Everyone is friendly, motivational, upbeat and professional especially during peek season which can seem to be never ending. You spend plenty of hours to yourself and on your feet it can be hard at first. You'll adjust to the job and it's non stressful."
good,"Just another typical day at work, opportunities to advance. Points for tardiness or unexcuse absence. Points determines chances to get promoted to blue badges after 30 days. Will post your name and productivity on chart. Furnish gloves, cutters, and vest by getting from vending machines after inserting tour id card. Safety vests and gloves must be worn at all times.  Some boxes get damages and have hazardous liquids or may contain irritants to exposed skin."
good,"Challenging."
good,Amazon is platform to make a significant impact on the bottom line. The ideal atmosphere for  professional and one in which new ideas are welcome and decision making is openly available opportunity.
good,compensation or promotions is not based on how many departments you have worked in..its basicly if your personality and people skills matches the ideals of the department that you want to be promoted to unfortunately.
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customer of which, in turn was a great learning experience because I have learnt customer behaviour. The management and colleagues we great, we all worked well both as a team and independently, great working environment overall."
good,"amazon is a great place to work, the only downsides are the long hours and the physical work that goes into it. the long work days would be a breeze if we had some kind of music to listen to at least."
good,"The work environment is good,team understing for work and also for fun activities,the culture is good high authorities helping is also good and understandable.the hard part of the days are of peak time.every day is enjoyable day with work."
good,The culture in Amazon is one of the most unique and productive. Its a competitive yet not cut throat warehouse. We have a unique management team that will support your decisions to move up in the company. Considering the warehouse Im currently at is strictly part time. I still won't change the experience of what I'm still having at Amazon.
good,I love this job. It is very fast paced but the pay is great. You will work a lot of hours but will grow from the experience. It is a hard place to work but it is worth it.
good,"My shift started at 445 in the morning until 3-4 PM. I worked full-time at 10 hours daily for 4 days per week. I liked and enjoyed my job and I was able to manage in just a few days of experience.  The pay rate was also fair. However,  I needed to relocate to be with family and friends."
good,"Ho lavorato per Amazon.it come CSA durante il picco 2016 e 2017."
good,Good Company to work for and amazing growth within the company. They are also not shy to allow you to develop yourself and always are supporting you to do your best. Overall a great enviroment to work in.
good,There was a great atmosphere and it was a fast paced and fun work environment. The hardest part of the job is you cant listen to head phones while working and some people applied without realizing they  would have to lift more then 50lb. Don't be that person that's annoying.
good,"Best place to work more thing to learn,better management.best office ever i worked with.never i face problem at amazon .inside office or outside the park"
good,Good Stuff loved it so much had fun great staff learn real quick great benifits long hours lots of good money though so happy to have been a part of this team
good,This company was a very fun place to work. I had a great time with the opportunities that I had. You learned new things everyday and went to different departments.
good,I love the management you tend to become a family with the employees at Amazon to the point where when someone quit or got fired or was almost as if you had sad moment of silence.
good,excellent opportunity for hard working people. Advancement for those who like the culture is very likely. Probable lifetime employment and good retirement.
good,It was a fun and fast pace place to work and everybody got along and the mangers was nice and helpful and u can learn a lot at amazon from working there
good,i love working there. management was great. everyday is different  your coworks make or buy diferrent food to bring in  like cookies or cakes it is a great place to work. P.A and mangers are great too
good,"love the motto of work hard, have fun and make history!  and though there are growing pains with making history, Amazon manages to instill a passion for recognizing and delivering excellence at various functional levels.  Let's hope that Raleigh wins the bid to have the Amazon HQ2!"
good,"compania inclusiva, excelente cultura laboral, conduce al exito laboral y desarollo profesional y personal."
good,"Its a very good platform to learn and expose your skills. I feel very secured with my management, I was enjoyed very well in different festival ocations, like providing special foods and appreciations."
good,"Despite the tedious work, in have found Amazon to be a fun environment. Managers are always trying to keep things light, even at the expense of being dweeby. I've gotten along with all my peers and made great friends.  The hardest part of the job is just the being on your feet. While some positions require walking your entire shift, others you may be standing in the same place the whole time. The work is EASY. Some days may be exhausting, particularly on overnights...  but it is EASY. Any write-ups are determined by math... no by managers picking on people; dont make your numbers? The comp uter generates the write-up, not a manager (even if a manager has to deliver it). They always have adequate supplies available; this is literally the first job in my over 25 years of working that I can say everything needed to perform my job is ALWAYS readily available. Their Amcare is the best thing ever... headache? Cramps? Ibuprophen is PROVIDED! Among many other things. No other job has ever assisted with my well being. Did I mention Amazon pays HALF of your medical insurance deductible? No other company has ever done that for me! 2 shares of stock... yes please. Something I appreciate is that if someone doesn't come into work... 1. My work load doesn't change - I still do what I am expected to do. And 2. They won't call me on my days off to beg me to cover for someone else. And I never directly deal with customers... That means NO STRESS. I love the way we take time off... log in on our phone and manage it though our time banks... there are 2 paid and 1 unpaid. I never have to call and"
good,"day shift start at 7,30 am ."
good,I really enjoyed working here I wish I would have applied for blue badge to be able to receive benefits as a seasonal worker my benefits as a amazon was very limited.
good,Each and everyday is an experience where company and the management is helping and enhancing each and every employees to grow high.Company is providing a great working environment and other benefits for employees.
good,"Work profile is good."
good,i like to work in amazon. I meet different people and learn some new things about their culture. I like how there are activities to take part in and chances to win some prizes.
good,My experience here was wonderful. I met a lot of new people. The work place has a lot to offer. You can learn many different things. There is also room to move up.
good,"It was nice working there. There are many perks, free coffee and popcorn. Discount on amazon sold items. Managers were great. I would still be working there if I hadn’t moved"
good,"I worked for Amazon directly as a picker. It's a lot of walking. They tell you it's a lot. They have a video to show that it's a lot. People still are not up for it. The facility I worked in we had scanners and the scanner would give you a little time telling you how many seconds you had to get to your next pick. It's an estimate because some picks there is no way you can get to them that fast.If you work at a steady and consistent pace and walk with a purpose you can make rate. If you cannot, they ask you what's going on. Sometimes they have system issues. Sometimes stowers are putting things away sloppy or other pickers are and not closing bins. Sometimes the conveyors are down and you can't put anything on it which slows you down but they recognize that issue especially if a lot of people have the same one.  Management really works with you to succeed. It's competitive but fun trying to beat the other shifts record. Great benefits, company stock, 401k, vision, dental, life. 10 hour shifts, 4 day workweek unless peak then it's 5 days, I believe 11 hours but I'm not certain. Great giveaways and prizes, raffles and drawings. They play music when and where they can. They give away free cupcakes and pretzels, free Thanksgiving meal. You can buy Red Robin I think once a week. I have been there as a temp many times and the only reason I'm still not there as an actual employee is because I moved an hour and almost crashed my car trying to commute while on 3rd shift."
good,"My favorite place to work! Break room is full of vending machines, they show to care so much of their employees. Great benefits as well. Managers are all awesome"
good,"love it there... I would recommend this job to anyone whom wants a job that is mostly stress free, job advancement is only limited to what you want to do..."
good,"I loved working at Amazon.com. I would work there again if there was a facility near me. The environment is very fast paced, and goal oriented. Rates must be made, but are attainable. They offer great on the job training, great benefits and pay. They offer multiple, regular shifts. I worked four ten hour shifts with three days off a week, and loved it. The hardest part of the job is the physicality of it. Lots of walking, bending, lifting. You will move at this job. I was a little sore sometimes, but I was also in the best shape I've ever been in. Overall, if you like to work hard, this is a great company to work for. Their benefits can't be beat, and they are always looking to improve. When it comes to advancement, it is competitive. A degree is usually a must. Military experience helps. Amazon wants to hire and promote only the best, and has done a good job of it. Safety of employees is top priority!"
good,Great place to work. Very busy... long hours... great compensation................................... standing on feet all day wear supportive shoes..... They care about their employees well being.
good,"1. More opportunities are provided to the employee for their career growth. "
good,"I start my working day in the early morning at 5:30 a.m, I punch in at 6:00 am; I attend the assembly in my department for the day's tips of the work. "
good,Good management fast paced keep you working I love it it’s not hard work but it’s alot of work to be done good training good employees  I love how they have You moving never in one spot
good,"Amazon is a leader in its field and therefore is evolving at a fast path."
good,Amazon is a great place to work.  The Managers are helpful and reliable.  The benefits are excellent.  There is room for advancement.  The scheduling is flexible.
good,Someone says hello every time you walk through the door. Its not like every other job. I do feel valued. The learning is at an acceptable level. Your are giving chances to proves what you can and can't do. There are amny different departments and opportunties. Some have better growth opportunties than others. Management is easily approachable. More positive than negative experiences.
good,"Go to your given station, a robot comes and the screen tells you where and what item to pick. Put it in the bin and hit the red button for the next item. Amazon is very diverse which I love about the company. Hardest part is meeting the required goal on a consist basis which is 380 items an hour (8.2 seconds per item). I just love the atmosphere that surrounds me."
good,"The job requires you to be on your feet and move fast. The job can be stressful but also fun. The staff made it easy working there, but some people took their job too serious."
good,A great day all the time. To have fun daily. Management  was awesome. Culture was very diverse. The hardest part was the long hours. The enjoyable part was stretching
good,I think this company is a great company to work for but I don't think there are many opportunities to advance and be promoted. It is a good part time job for people who want some extra cash or for people who go to school.
good,"Amazon was a different  atmosphere  for me ,but I'm a quick leaner. They train you and are patient  with you. I learned  alot working there . I would  definitely come  back"
good,Fast past but not much of a Chang to advance punctuality is important as well as eating choices limited very little room for errors pay was helpful too
good,Working environment is good. Many opportunities to grow within the workplace and incentives are good. Friendly staff. I believe my hardest part of the job was starting this initial job because I dealt with an angry customer and then again I had many occasions of conflict with people within the company who accused me of things I did not do. Otherwise Amazon is the best place I had ever worked at.
good,"Amazon.com is one of those companies that is employee-friendly. It gives lot of space and freedom concerned with work flexibility, dress code, etc. AT the same time work becomes self driven by the individual employee more than being driven by the higher-up."
good,work and stuff and chickens and work and amazon great don't forget those chickens work and stock amazon do it for America do it for amazon food fights
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Amazon. They pay well and everyone is extremely nice. I'm a full time college student and they were able to accommodate my schedule so I could still work. The company is all about helping customers which I love as well."
good,"Overall what to say very good experience people are helpful,supportive, lot of learning , working culture, HR polices ,etc there are no further words to say very good organization."
good,His company was a great company fun place and fast paced. The people there made working here a blast. There is always space to move up and hard work goes a long way.
good,"I enjoyed working at Amazon.  Its a hard job, very taxing on the body.  They should pay more, but the benefits are great. You can transfer to other places with ease which would be nice if you want to make a career of working there."
good,I like working there just since I walk alot I feel like the breaks dont give me enough time for my feet to stop hurting. The clocking in and out is hard since there so many people doing it at the same time and Amazon really strict about clocking in on time. Everyone is really friendly though.
good,good experience with this company. they give high opportunity for growth. i am very satisfied with this company. But I need growth for my further life.
good,It was an easy job but very demanding. The breaks were short. The hours were long. There is not a lot of opportunity to move up in the company. They paid well. They have great benefits.
good,"Starts at 9 in the morning"
good,"Working at Amazon as an intern was a great experience. Although the environment was fast paced , that it was kept me alive during my long shifts. Due to the fact the energy is always high and you are constantly pushed by your superiors to get the most out of your team. The senior management their is great , they are always their by your side if you ever feel like you can't solve a problem and will not leave you hanging. During my time their I learned how to multitask very well ,and communicate with my peers at a higher level. It also opened my eyes on what it is like to run an operation which I had never had experience in before. I would definitely recommend Amazon.com to anyone who does not want an office job and wants to make on thousands of lives daily."
good,"Pros: Fast pace growth, lots to learn and wide exposure to international practices. Freedom to pick up ideas and projects, and work towards closure. Great mentorship and support from individuals."
good,"In order to get a job with Amazon you have to have one thing...PATIENCE!!! (If you're not internet savy then get someone to help you out because Amazon sends out emails and you have to stay on top of those) Before I was extended an offer of employment I had the opportunity to read all of the reviews, most of which, were negative. However a job is what you make it...go to work, do your job and go home to your family. If you work slow then Amazon may not be your calling. Day 1 your job is to learn as much as your brain will hold and get the job done. No matter the task, no matter who you don't like, no matter if the break was short, just get in there and give it your all because not only does Amazon hire, they also fire. Just make sure that you're working for all of the right reasons and your experience will be remembered for a lifetime. (If you thought because my post was long that I had something bad to say...sorry...keep scrolling:)"
good,"Omezení osobního života , málo svozovych lokalit na již daných trasách ."
good,Great place to work. It was hard honest work. I enjoyed working at Amazon i learned various shipping and receiving techniques i learned to memorie group numbers scanning merchandise. Proper handling of various merchandise
good,"If you have great work ethics and enjoy a fast pace environment then amazon is a get job to work at.  Started at a recently opened location and I love it.   I came from retail management and its a totally different environment.  The people in my area are great, my manager is great.  They seem to be understanding and benefits are outstanding.  You work 4 days on 3 off unless you are on mandatory OT, if your area is really behind you may have to work 60 hours a week.  It is a lot of walking, Usually about 20000 a day if not more."
good,"Best work culture,I had an amazing time working with Amazon. Many learning and growth opportunities. If you are talented and interested, you can move to any field in Amazon. Work culture is at par with any other Company."
good,Amazing work ethic! Love the way people work as well as have fun! Very helpful and understanding management and co-workers. Relieved and stress free work atmosphere.
good,"I learned a lot about photoshop,  and now i can use pen tabs"
good,Good place to work life balace and the work culture is awesome. Able to learn many things in and out of the work. Environment is so good to work. Amazon cares more on their employees.
good,"Amazon provides a number of great benefits for their employees. They have provide pay and a schedule that is guaranteed, and they treat their employees well. It is hard work so it's not for the faint of heart."
good,"Amazon was great to work at. There is a lot of opportunity to advance in the company. Unfortunately, It was just too far from my house for the pay. If it were closer, I would still be there, and hopefully very high in the company."
good,"A typical day at work consists of getting your order picker, driving down very narrow aisles, reading an RF gun, picking the orders as quickly as possible and getting them to the packing station on time to get the orders shipped out that day.  It can get a bit stressful to keep up your rate, but if you are careful, and stay on task, you can do the job without much trouble."
good,"El pago fue bueno, el ambiente ameno. Tenian consideracion con los trabajadores."
good,Multiple positions to learn and get certified for. Great teamwork environment. Work shift goes by fast due to the continuous movement from one task to the next.

good,"It's a great place to work, very diverse environment, lots of advancement opportunity. Great benefits and lots of learning opportunity. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in knowing and learning the latest processes and technology associated with a warehouse environment."
good,"Fun place to work, but its very fast paced work environment. The hardest part about the job is having to work in a small space. The most enjoyable part is working with cool people."
good,"Every employee got along well.  It was a fast paced environment. It was a very good place to work at, as a second job. It was also an easy job, but you have to be walking frequently."
good,"I injoyed working at Amazon. Amazon is fast past. Amazon as gear benefits that you can take the opportunity to receive such as medical, dental and vision care insurance.  Amazon has a awesome work place environment and career growth potential. Everything is measured for productivity."
good,i believe Amazon is one of the best companies you can work for. My favorite thing i like about Amazon is the stocks you receive from them after 2 yrs.
good,Amazon is good place to work. Its too far from my house and less paying. Amazon offers great benefits and take care of their employes. Its a warehouse physical job and it make me well disciplined.
good,"If you are good at working hard and not scared of fast pace this is the place for you. A typical day starts off with you coming in and scan your card so they know that you were there on time, you have to bring your own lunches but they provide free water or you can bring your own. Managemnet is pretty good and they try to help you as much as they can."
good,ambiance très agréable pour travaillé avec le sourire ce qui donne envie de faire encore mieux

good,"The job is pretty simple and cool if you want to earn extra money. Come in, go to your assigned lane, and scan packages to place on pallets to be shipped. The hours are cool, you select your desired schedule when you first come in to do the drug testing. If you don't get what you want/need, you can put in a request to change it. Be prepared to be on your feet the whole time and moving, also wear comfy clothes and shoes! The job is a workout. if you don't like being on your feet then it's not for you. As a person who is used to being in an office and sitting behind a desk all day, it's a cool different change of atmosphere. Can't say anything bad about it right now."
good,"Fast-pace fun place to work.  The management is great.  They give prizes for hard work. The hardest part of the job is getting comfortable working 10 hrs on your feet everyday, but you do become comfortable."

good,"VERY productive in fast paced environment, enjoyed the hours I worked and Supervisor I WORKED under. It was probably one of my most satisfactory positions."
good,"the hours are long but you work 4 days a week peek times 60 hours. I personally have kids and couldn't work the hours now that they are in school, so I'm looking for a new job"
good,"This can be a great place to work if you are willing to work very hard. You can build a great a career without a college degree or while you get one. The benefits are excellent for this type of position. Learn the management principals, use them, work hard and watch your career blossom."
good,"This is a great company to work for with lots of benefits.  The only draw back was the hours as I was working nights on the back half of the week, so I had little time to see my family, but I'm sure with other schedules, it is better."
good,It was amazing working four0 days a week and getting three days off. I had been offered to train new associates a month in to my employment with them.
good,"Empresa onde tive oportunidade de desenvolver minhas experiencias profissionais, com apoio e confiança por parte da diretoria."
good,I was only there seasonal however while i was there i learned how to separate the boxed off the truck and place them on different pallets to be shipped back out.

good,"great working enviroment to work at, the people there are amazing to work with, the managers have a great sense of understand the work, and love to work with the rest of the workerrs."
good,even in  high pace environment the tasks are not overwhelming. The company take very good care of their employees. tons of paid time off and appreciation for hard work
good,Amazon is a very friendly workplace with all amenities. The work culture in Amazon is very good. Amazon has got lot of growth opportunities. Hardest part of the job is rotational shift and week offs.
good,Operated an order picker all day which was hard on the feet but the work wasnt terrible.  They have great benefits and paid time benefits.  The point system was very reasonable.
good,"High goals for associates, but achievable goals. If you are willing to put in the effort, you can move into better positions just by asking. Management changes often but keeps it interesting."
good,"Everyday I come to work, I feel ready to make my goals and have a fun time doing it! I currently work as a picker in the warehouse and it is like a scavenger hunt when looking for items!"
good,It's ok!! but are you willing to be stressed. It was a job that I had already experienced from other job that I worked. You get to meet new people. This is a place to work for young kid.
good,"Enjoyed my time at amazon"
good,"It was fast steady pace of work throughout the day.  I Learned to use a hand scanner or a wrist scanner to scan packages. The people were nice to me.  I Earned a reasonable paycheck directly deposited to checking account. The hardest part was making sure that the packages on the conveyor belt don't get mixed up with other packages on different lanes.  The Warehouse had to be maintained in order, organized, and kept clean for each day the workers come to Amazon warehouse."
good,"The company is totally awesome to work for .. timezone with North America is the only challenge"
good,Good place to work with.  Nice environment and very good people to learn and enhance your career.  Regular team building activities.  Overall a good place to set your career
good,I pick boxes and pack them into a bigger size. I make sure all boxes are closed tight and sorted properly. I think people will like the environment at Amazon
good,One of the best companies to work for. Very hands on and nice leaders who wants you to succeed. And works with you. There if you need assistance. Great!
good,While working for Amazon I realized that it was one of the most easy jobs you could ever have. If you like sitting on your butt and taking some phone calls that usually get transferred then this is the job for you. I personally kept it to where people at work were just work friends because working for Amazon is also like being in high school again. Then again it's customer service so everyone is trained to be nice to your face no matter what they think about you!
good,"warehouse work isnt for everyone but if you enjoy moving around and staying busy i recommend this job. the compensation and benefits that come with the job are more than enough, you are offered chances to move up or crosstrain, could use a longer lunch or if there was music played over a speaker"
good,"I love working from home and being able to work at night while my child is sleeping. Like any customer service position, it can be stressful and mentally tiring, but I like working for Amazon. My manager is laid back and awesome too. I've been through a few managers in my short time here, but they have all been good. Even though I'm working from home I still have the support I need and we do work as a team."
good,"I enjoyed working for Amazon I wish to go back again. They have a great management team, communication is excellent with them, benefits are amazing, other workers are happy to be there."

good,I've learned many things and helpful life skills and responsibilities. It is a place to me that teaches culture and has a great lunch room and prizes if you work hard enough.
good,Working at amazon is a lot of hard work which teaches us to be responsble.We all play a big role at amaazon because of our managers and other associates that work day in and day out to help our customers get their orders in a safe and timely matter.
good,"Good workplace to have expierence, always look for productivity and quality. Here i meet new interesting people. Very liked workplace, because it is only 4 miles from home."
good,"Prime now is definitely one of my favorite jobs. I have worked here about a year and I absolutely love the environment. The hours are super flexible, also management explains work process flawlessly. Training doesn't take to long so your on the floor right away. Coworkers are super friendly, and drivers are courteous."
good,"I'm a Sortation Associate, I just do is sort the packages and scan them. I also do other things like water spider, inbound, and sort slide. I learned that if you work hard, and the management will notice, and will give you respect. The management is pretty good. A lot of diverse people, and we all get along. The hardest part is lifting heavier boxes. The most enjoyable part is rewarding."
good,"nice atmosphere and ambiance to work for, people are good and friendly managers are friendly and you get nice amenities to relax yourself after work the shift timings also is flexible"
good,"overall a good place to work if you enjoy long hours and mandatory overtime. there is room for growth, my 1 month of working here i was already being cross-trained in different departments"
good,"Very productive fast paced job. There is a Productivity rate you have to hit every day. There is a very set way that amazon is ran, you get training in almost everything receiving, picking, packing, and dock."
good,"I love working at Amazon, if I can do it again I will the only reason why I quit was because I had to move and where I moved to have Amazon so I am willing to do it again. Everyone is positive , hard workers, very encouraging and it pays well with great benefits. Amazon in my opinion feels like they value your hard work. I've gotten a lot of thank you and gift cards just by working hard."
good,Good work culture. The management is fine however less chance of growth and increment. There is a good management system and easy to approach hierarchy In Amazon.
good,. I come in through security. Very active place. Everyday was different. Filling customer orders of stocking the products as a stower. I learned that supervisors would coach me in areas that needed improvement. Safety was always instilled during morning meeting. The afternoon stretch  was good. The hardest part of working there was that I was so close to rate but really did not get there.
good,Everyone complaining about the job i have worked here 3 times now. Yes there are targets that have to be met and yes sometimes they are hard but whats the point in working if it is easy. I love the challenge of the job and the fact there are targets to meet otherwise what would the point be. Everyone expects to work nights or days and sit around chatting with their friends all night/day getting £8- £9.75 a hour thats not how it works. If your not afraid of hard work then this job is perfect and the wages are good also. 4 days at normal rate then 5th is time and a half then 6th is double time. I am applying again now the 4th time to work im not afraid of hard work or walking upto 20 miles a night around the warehouse if picking. If you like to sit on your bum and get paid then this is not the job for you.
good,This is a physically challenging position but very easy mentally. Most people are respectful and good to work with.  Will go back for seasonal season in the fall.
good,The work culture at amazon was amazing. It feels like you are in a college. I learned a lot of things there. The work place environment is very fee. All the colleagues were good.
good,Excelent workplace.Lots of learning .Nice management. Very flexible  shifts. Accesible in everyway that they can help employees in a verybfriendlyenviroment.
good,Amazon is a great place to work at especially with all the benefits all though you have to meet their requirements and goals and rates in order to continue with amazon but it's worth it with all the benefits and the pay is great as welll getting a 25 cent raise every 90 days
good,This job is a great job. The hours are. Flexible and the managers are very respectful. There is much growth opportunity in Amazon so it's a great start for anyone!
good,"This is easily my favorite job that I've ever had. Typical day was answering calls within my department. Any basis for customer service, I learned from this job. Management was great about leading you to do better rather than making you feel like you've made a mistake."
good,The work culture is really good. The management and people are always helpful. The hardest part of the job was the rotational shifts.Everything else is super cool.
good,Well it was my first  warehouse job and I really liked it love working with the people I got to work with the managers were really nice and then ours was OK great benefits  but the pay was not the best  because I was out performing everyone around me!
good,"At amazon, it's really fast paced. I learned time management skills and easy to learn. The management when I was there was okay. Though they could have done a bit better. Everyone was friendly and we all got along fine. The hardest part working at amazon would be scanning. I like how easy going it was and how nice everyone was."
good,Stable environment. Very comfortable in and outside facilities. Well taken care of. They seem to value each employees Well being also input on running the facilities better.
good,Amazon been the largest growing company keeps its standards every where. Customer obsession is the base line. Just loving working with a company which really cares about employees and customer as well.
good,"I found it very fun and exciting to work for amazon."
good,"I remember going in here thinking if I would be able to perform the tasks I would be assigned. Sure enough it was not as bad as I first thought. Your leads and supervisors will help you succeed here. Just do not be hesitant to speak up to explain what it is that you need assistance. If you prefer a more clean work environment then this may be the place for you. Unlike your typical warehouse environment that can be really unclean, dusty and rather uncomfortable depending upon the weather Amazon stands out from the norm. You will appreciate the air conditioning the provide in the summer. It is rather impressive they go out the way to make your work environment a comfortable one. If you want to try something new then I would say this might be a good match for you."
good,"great work space , awesome team work involved , learned a lot by doing this job. Dealt with many packages and volumes at a minimum time , excellent work experience"
good,"Each day was tackled as if it's day one,by exceeding expectations and and going above and beyond your limitations. I've learned that teamwork improves work ethics as well as productivity, the culture at Amazon is very positive this too promotes growth with gaining experience from colleagueschool and superiors."
good,I love the atmosphere and generosity of the staff there the energy that everyone brings a very positive of my time there was great and I will always have a job there and will always recommend this position and location..
good,If your hardworking and ambitions they have alot to offer you & your future. They have many ways of advancement and are always promoting people. Plus it's like a gym working at the warehouse.
good,"Unfortunately I was laid off at Amazon due to the Tul1 facility closing down.  But I enjoyed my time with amazon. There were many departments to get trained in so it was easy to switch up work areas, so I never got too tired of doing something over and over."
good,If this is your first job as a CSA then it can be a bit nerve racking at first however you soon grow use to Amazon's procedures then it becomes a cake walk. My team lead is wonderful and always able to explain things to the best of her ability and there's never a wrong question.
good,Must be ready to do hard work for great pay. This is not for ones who are just starting if you have not work as in a fast paces paced environment but it pays well for over time.
good,It was fast paced and challenging . As with all customer service it had its good days and bad days but for the most part I loved going to work every day !
good,At Amazon you are continually on your feet and you cant just walk around slowly because you have to make a quota/rate per day.  I did like this job at first but then it became boring after a while and there really isn't much room for advancement in the company
good,"A typical day at amazon was very simple .You walk in , scan your badge ,report to the front, look for your name and go to where they rostered you after stand-up, Break, and back to work until the shift is over."
good,I enjoyed the job very much. The people who I worked with made it easy for me to understand. Amazons hours didn't work so well with my class schedule so I had to let it go.
good,"Great Atmosphere. Fast pace job, but I always got the job done. It was pretty hard because you always had to get a certain percentage of packages done by your shift, but overall it was a good place to work in."
good,Although it was not as long as my previous job it was good. Management wants you to succeed at the job. It just wasn't the right job for me. I could not connect with it.
good,"I cannot recommend Amazon.com enough as a great place to work, especially if you are in a place in life where your career is your main priority. The only reason I am wanting to look for another job is because my professional career is no longer my main priority."
good,This is a really great company to work for. They only offer part time positions for majority positions except for management. This company appreciates every employee.
good,when i worked for amazon it was very hard work. i was a picker. i would have to work super fast all the time or it would be easy to get written up. it wasn't my favorite job but it was a job.
good,Amazon is a good job. I enjoy working at amazon but I am only getting 20 hours a week and I need more. I tried transferring but they are not going to accept transfers till June. I need a full time job before June.
good,When I started at Amazon it was an amazing place to be. I was proud. I loved the warehouse environment I liked running around to do My job which kept me busy for my ten hour shift.
good,Wow working for Amazon and getting paid by integrity was an amazing experience.This job became my passion and i enjoyed watching my fellow employees play friendly matches of ping pong among each other.
good,"Amazon was an amazing experience that i will never forget for the rest of my life.A typical day at work was filled with excitement and joy.I loved every second of it because it was challenging.I learned what the distribution centers were all about,and how important it was that packages were sorted correctly.Management helped me learn to do all my work efficiently and productively.They were also very professional."
good,I earned sufficient money to fulfill my basic needs myself. It helps to increase my financial level. It is the one of the famous company in the North America. I am very happy that i worked in a a warehouse. I never expected in my life before.
good,"Well Paid."
good,Going through the process of sorting and assembling packages. Also verifying that the product that we are sending out gets to the correct person in the proper packaging.
good,All around the best job you can have. The people are awesome and you have every resource aroubd you to succeed that you could possobly want. The best place to be honestly
good,"Excellent place to work if the team around is good enough, and the work atmosphere is too good and growth is also very good as you get to learn more, have many advantages as an employee and company is very supportive and best place to work with"
good,"Great place to learn about a myriad of industries which promotes internal transfers to different teams and departments. In the heart of Seattle, one is close to lots of great culture, two mountain ranges and the ocean which all offer an endless supply of outdoor activities."
good,Amazon is a good place to work and I would recommend any friend to work here. The work culture also is very good. The best part is the fun activities on every Fridays. There are also many awards and recognition every month. The management is also very approachable.
good,"Amazon is a great place to work for. Yes your on your feet and moving alot sometimes but what job isn't like that? Management by me are very helpful and when you do a great job they praise you for it. Benefits are great. "
good,"Working with Amazon was short time but interesting. My first at home job, so the experience was well worth learning, and being able to read and learn about different steps of tthe job"
good,a typical day at work involves loading the groceries for the customers. I learned how to be fast as well as how to effectively take care of the customers. management is the bees knees. the hardest part is how cold it gets. They should really think about how they keep the things in there cold. the most enjoyable part is getting paid every week.
good,"Missions de stage très adéquates à un poste d'ingénieur amélioration continue."
good,"For me is a pleasure to work with Amazon!"
good,"Amazon is overall an excellent place to work. For me being ex-military, i found that it wasn't much different than that.  Being asked to change up and do something else at the drop of a dime was nothing.  Yes there were hardships too, but on top of that you had great people to work with to make the experience awsome"
good,friendly management and freedom to work make us feel comfortable and also it reduces work pressure ever if we had a lot of work.... an awesome place to work in India.
good,"When you got to work you started off with a department stretching, while they told you news of the work place and anything upcoming that you needed to be informed about. I learned to work hard and to be efficient in my work, i was trained in forklift safety as well as to operate one. Management was fantastic always keeping things running smoothly, always tried to make for a safe work environment, asked what we thought would help and could change to make things better for us. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable part of the job which was the fast paced environment always trying to make rate while trying not to make errors."
good,"Working at Amazon, you get many different experiences in many departments. You make sure as a picker that you get the customers order in a timely fashion while also making sure it isn't damaged. Everyone of the managers are very helpful and they show their appreciation in many ways, from giving free snacks to having activities before work begins. It's a lot of work walking over 10 miles a day but you are making history."
good,"Is a good place to work, long hours hard-work, but compensations are great. You work 10 hrs shift for four days and three days off. Is fast pace environment."
good,"In the morning, you find yourself standing in a circle with your peers in your department, your manager in the center giving you an update on the current expectations for the department as a whole. It is here that people who have gone above and beyond expectations are recognized, where call-outs for accountability are done, and where the Safety Committee representative for the department does their brief summary for the week. Then you stretch to ensure you are properly warmed up, grab your gear, get assigned your work, and head out. Throughout your shift, you are never guaranteed that you are going to be doing the same task all day. You may be called off to do something else, to train someone or be trained on a new task. At the end of shift, you turn in your gear, make sure everything is ready for the next shift and head out. "
good,"Management makes sure your taken care of, properly hydrated, motivated, and excited to be part of the Amazon team. they set a goal daily for everyone to meet, but they  add competition to it, with rewards. the hardest part of the job is the bending, lifting, and walking around a little fast paced on concrete floors."
good,have a good freedom.. all plus ponts.. good growth.. free transport.. good income..  2 days weekoff is really amazing. promotions on regular basis.. luvv u Amazon
good,"excellente expérience au sein d'un grand groupe américain, le salaire est excellent pour de l'intérim, seul certains manager de lauwin-planque son irrespectueux."
good,"In der kurzen Zeit die ich bei Amazon gearbeitet habe, habe ich viel Freude am Arbeiten gehabt und gute Freundschaften geschlossen."
good,Amazon is a fantastic company. Great culture and management. Sometimes not very flexible with scheduling but overall a great place to work. Not very surprising Amazon is growing as fast as it is.
good,"A typical day at Amazon consists of 10-12 hours of standing up/ walking, lots of movement & productivity deadlines that need to be met so I must work swiftly and efficiently. I learned how to manage my time, understand over 10 different departments in the building, how to communicate with others and most importantly how to gain confidence in myself. Management at Amazon is getting better at first we had a lot to be desired. I was at amazon for 6 months before I even knew who my manager was until the new GM came in and our managers were required to engage with associates. "
good,"It was an oher all wonderful experience,  it taught me how to deal with different people and I am grateful for the chance that I was given to work there"
good,"its very fast paced, independent, cool work place, you basically get breaks every 3 hours, lunch on 4th hour of work, very tiring, standing for 10 hours, lifting 50 pounds"
good,amazon out of everywhere i have worked is really faced paced the only down fall to this place i would say is the managers don't seem to get your questions answered fast enough to help the customer and leaves you hanging to make a choice. other than that I like the place.
good,"Good work culture, good peer , no dress code , fun to work . Good overtime wages , good night shift allowance . Managers on the floor are employee friendly."
good,"With the best technology and one of the best team its the best place to work with. I have learned a lot."
good,"Love it,work is fun.they work with you,on days off they understand family.they are willing to teach new jobs to you .dress code is great.just a cool place to work"
good,"Amazon is a workplace where an employee can work without any hassel. deadlines and targets are very certain enough to fulfill, managers and leads are very supportive,"
good,"Amazon is a great company to work for! My position there was only seasonal, I wish i could get a full time position with them! They were amazing and helpful people!"
good,Easy place to work with minimal training required to do your job. Lots of room for hours and advancement. Very fun environment when you have the right coworkers.
good,"I worked as a contract employee in Amazon UK's development centre in Edinburgh , Scotland. It was too goof to work there as i enjoyed every part of it."
good,"Work hard, Have fun, Make History... the best place to work, very friendly and the leaders are the best, the place where you'll find working at home with your family."
good,sometime busy but the good thing is when we have special occasion like prime day we worked their as a team its have too fun I really enjoyed. you have to worked as a machine but good thing is they paid good money.
good,"All in all brilliant learning experience in entire carrier,"
good,"I enjoyed the pace at Amazon. It demanded focus and consistency, but it also allowed you to have fun. You were also recognized and rewarded for going above the expected."
good,Everyday is always day 1 at amazon because there is always something new to learn everyday we come up with new challenges to work with and new scenarios. The work environment and work culture is really good there
good,Opportunities to explore beyond the call of duty.A structured career path and a clear hierarchy pattern. Employee treated as equal as customers.
good,"I really enjoyed my employment with the Amazon.com family and I only left due to a personal enhancement in my life.  Unforntunatly, i had to move and the near facility had no opening for me and elected to leave the company."
good,I would walk for miles picking orders for customers. It was like going shopping. I learned the steps and processes it takes just for a package to go out and how it gets shipped to customers. If you had any problems management would take care of it immediately. Everyone got along with everyone and if you needed help with someone coworkers were always there to ask. The hours were long because I would go to school as soon as I got off. I really enjoyed working with a company that is there for there employees.
good,Ambiente lavorativo stimolante in quanto ha tanti reparti
good,good experience fun place to work mostly in the holidays give out a lot of priezes. the hardest part is keeping up rate everyday
good,I liked the amazon is you are working 8 hours a day if you can stand the extra hours are paid after 40 hours with 12 city have been working hard what to say was well mau fired without any rasppun called me and meow said today remain at home because they no longer need me
good,"my agency were fantastic to work for "
good,"Great Place To Work, Workplace Friendly, Lots Of Hard Work, Employees Are Treated Kindly & We Make Sure That Our Customers Are Always Satisfied"
good,"was only a seasonal worker and was laid off after 4 ramp downs, the work is rewarding, you get to help alot of people on a daily basis. really good wage and the managers are great. You get continual coaching every week too so you are continually improving on your skills. Would love to work there again. There is stability and progression in the job if you manage to get hired full time."
good,it was great to meet our deadline and have good team work. you can learn alot of different things about shipments etc.i enjoyed staying very busy at all times..there are only a few jobs that are hard and tiring..but the rest is great.
good,10 hr. days ok during not so busy weeks but when they are busy little notice of overtime is given and during the holidays your mostly at work you can transfer but it is almost impossible you can put it in and if its open they will but there is no way to know what is open HR doesn't even know.
good,This was my first ever job and I had learnt a lot in it. I went through many different positions in a span of 17 months which I believe no other company can provide. I would love to work for Amazon in the future if I get a chance.
good,"1. Brainstorming in teams sitting around in a calm environment"
good,Top Management is very good. There is a network team of employees who monitors everything and updates the required information for top management. So it helps to make the work place better.
good,"I really liked it there, by myself most of the day. alot of the managers and most employees turned out to be helpful when I needed them. Management was great tending to any questions I had or explaining easier ways to get my work done. Pretty fast paced and you dont really have to see anyone except on break or when your passing someone to get your order"
good,It was a fun enviroment and i meant loads of great people. The chance to improve your skills and learn new skills is always an option to use. It's a very fast paced but fun and enjoyable workplace best part of the job is meeting new people and your always kept busy and your always learning something and the chance to advance in positions is always available.
good,"I have been with Amazon for just over a year and a half. I have had rough days at work, just like any other job, but for the most part it's not bad going to work. This is a place you don't have to dread showing up to. Management is great, and employees make the day so much more. I have met an awesome group of people here. All Amazon asks in return is for you to work hard. If you show up to work everyday wanting to grow, learn and explore more options with opportunities available to you, this is the place. Amazing benefits and higher wages."
good,"Amazon is a very nice place to work, easy to learn your daily work and there is someone always willing to help you out if you need anything. very fast paced work."
good,Amazon is an amazing place to work at. The times are fantastic and the productivity keeps you busy so you won't stand around doing nothing. Watch out for some management because they will choose favourites and watch out for gossip and try your best to avoid situations that would bring drama afterwards because it will carry over in the long run. It's a warehouse and if you worked warehouse jobs before then you know it's true.
good,"nice environment for the job its real a good experience working in amazon. Everyone is friendly there. leaders were loyal and honest "
good,I have been working here since October and I have enjoyed my experience thus far.  This job is not for the faint of heart and if you like to stay busy this is the place for you.
good,"Working for Amazon has by day been one of the best jobs I've had."
good,"I walk nearly 5 miles a day working with many people. I learned how to multicast effectively. I've helped manage people when the area manager wasn't present. A large variety of culture that is supported and cherished by all. The most difficult part of the job was long overtime overs. The most enjoyable is the people I work with,"
good,dress properly and wear some comfortable shoes it goes by fast some night better than other weekly pay and other benefits offered. great place easy to catch on not to hard
good,"I like the location. All the employee at Amazon are nice And helpful! Management go out there way to make sure everyone is comfortable with the job they are preforming,"
good,"Great work environment. Room for advancement and to learn other jobs. Its really neat to see how all of the positions work together to fulfill one role, to provide exemplary customer service around the globe."
good,Amazon is a great company to work for and it is easy to advance in the company. Amazon also has amazing benefits for there employees and there families.
good,Worked at Amazon for 4 years. Great place to learn and work with talented and smart people. Fun culture. Friendly people. Good compensation. Good work life balance.
good,"Too good work culture and lot of opportunity to learn new things for the mutual development of company and myself. Learnt ownership, team work, deep dive, troubleshooting errors, handling escalations, training process, process improvement and automation. Management is very good and coworkers are friendly and helpful."
good,"A typical day at Amazon is meeting lots of good new people.. Its tons of merchandise in one warehouse, which means different job availability's. You have lots of team leads from different departments if you had any questions or concerns about your job. Through out the day you will run across items that you will never seen before, and meet great people. The pay could be better for the work you do."
good,"I love it there, the people are great and Amazon culture is amazing. It's pretty much laid back as long as you can keep up with your rate although for a lot of the work there is a learning curve."
good,"some people just dont work , need tighter management, process to become higher management is rough . nice breakroom , also the explanation of the company is great , they sell the idea, yet when it boils down they like to hire outside ,"
good,"Every morning when we would clock in we would all huddle up with the rest of our department to stretch and talk about what's going on with our department. Then we would get our scanners and head to our designated lines. We would grab boxes or totes that would come down a large conveyer belt, scan the box or tote and the location of where it's going, and proceed to build a pallet. Management would come around every so often to check what's happening on the floor."
good,Amazon is a great company but it is hard on your body to work 10 or more hours a day.  Your body will be hurting by the end of the day.  I work hard but I have not reached my 250 rate per hour goal yet.
good,Amazon was a great experience for me. I like the fast pace work environment. Amazon really taught me alot. Work was very informational everyday.
good,"I love working for amazon awesome!"
good,"Good place to work and gain more knowledge and develop your skills"

good,"pues mi primero dia de trabajo,el chico y la chica que me enseñaste como funciona las cosas y como ubicar las mercancias con pistola radio frecuencia son perfectos,y con esto no me cuesta de aprender."
good,"I worked during the holidays so I was working 10 to 11 hour shifts every week packing boxes and sending them to the conveyor. The most enjoyable the multiple and music that would play during work. The management was great, I did't have any type of issues with them and they answered any question that I had. the hardest part was getting up at 5:30 to be there by 6:30. Some of the Co-workers that I met I instantly connected with and where the people I would sit with during lunch."
good,I will give very much time in this job .I am ready for this all type of jobs so please give me a chance .iam in better experience with this type of job
good,This was an easy job and I got paid every two weeks. If they noticed someone doing a great job they will actually give you compliments and also gifts for your hard work.
good,"A typical day at work was checking inventory issues from customer complaints on product that was wrong size, wrong color, didn't work, or expired. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning new things daily to maintain inventory integrity for the company as well as the customer.  The worst part of the job was the heat in the warehouse during the summer time before they installed air conditioners."
good,Joined as a technical support agent in Amazon. My job was to respond to customers with queries about digital products developed by Amazon. It was a great work culture and many opportunities to learn.
good,"Amazon is an American electronic commerce and cloud computing company. It is the largest Internet-based retailer in the World by total sales and capitalization and also stands at the top of 100 globally-known brands across seven major industries."
good,Busy fast paced job. You are never left with nothing to do. Managers are all attentive. Employees vary in work ethic and motivation. Dress standards are a bit low unfortunately but you don't go to work to look at people. Every day was different and I enjoyed doing different functions and working different areas daily. They are flexible with personal schedules.

good,"It's overall easy to get into the rhythm of what you do. It's enjoyable, and the co-workers are mostly positive. Management is exceptional. The hardest part of the job is to maintain a constant energetic pace at the last quarter. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new skills. I learned how to communicate well with management and co-workers. Also, how to handle challenging situations."
good,Amazon is an amazingly open and diverse company to work for. They cherish the employee by making them feel as comfortable as possible to ensure maximum output on their part. Amazon builds employees up for future positions and pushes for advancement by going over career plans and letting you lead your own path. The best company I've ever worked for.
good,"Great place to work if you are a hard worker. Stand on your feet for ten hours 4 days a week. I've enjoyed working at amazon.  My night shift manager was amazing .

good,I loved working here it was a fun place to work. Mostly you just assist customers with the problems they are having with their orders that they have placed. Wild and crazy style here you can just be you.
good,"Before every shift began, they had a team huddle, where stretches took place and had work appreciation of different types. When work began, if you are working according to pace and show quality of work, no supervisor or any manager would come to disturb because all your work is system monitored and the supervisors have the access to all your work related data. There are awards to be won every week like, a Kindle Fire tablet, or a Fitbit, or a giftcard, for anybody who shows exceptional work ethics. Lunch room has many games like, ping-pong, XBOX, Play Station, air hockey, and such. Work environment is really nice considering the type of work it is. There are many rights, facilities, and proper gear, provided to you by Amazon, so you can do your work with ease and comfort and most importantly with respect. The hardest part of the job was wearing safety shoes the whole time and walking considerable distances due to the massive scale of the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the work is the ability to work with the people you like and everything else."
good,"Very fun workplace, everyone is like family. Is a customer oriented company and wants all the employees to be customer oriented also. The management takes safety of the employees very seriously."

good,"I was a Forklift Driver and i was stowing all day for months and my rate performance was through the roof, i didn't mind it but over time i felt i wanted to do something else for amazon but wouldn't give me the chance. And soon after i was transferred to another building where there Rates were unbelievably high, so high that it was hard for anyone that wasn't used to it sorta miserably fail at this. And They Fired Because of This!"
good,"Amazon is a wonderful place to work at. Amazon made sure we under stood the work that we were doing before Amazon let us do it own our own.

good,A typical day at work would include meeting or exceeding the given rate for the specific station you were on. You could be moved at any given time based on the needs of the day. The management was always friendly and willing to work with you to help get you out of a bottleneck or if you needed more training on a specific station. The hardest part of the job was the long ten hour work days.
good,"This company makes you feel like part of a family. If you have a problem they do whatever they can to help fix it for you. when on the packing line, you always switch positions so you are not stuck working just one part all the time. You are taught new machinery for packing and if you don't already know how, they teach you to use a forklift for inventory. Management always listens to your problems and ideas. your coworkers are fun-loving but still get the job done right. The hardest part of the job was, for me, the quitting time. sometimes you have to stay late and for people with families, it can get hard but is worth it. The best part of the job is always being able to work with new people."
good,While working at amazon I learned how to work with a team to complete an overall goal. I also learned the importance of building a strong relationship with my managers to help/guide me to completing my/our company goal.

good,"my day I wake up head to the warehouse with my manager load our trucks for the days deliveries. I map out our route for the day and scheduled our lunch breaks . My supervisor is the best he encourages me to ask questions and always there to show me how to do things that I don't always get or understand he's a really great teacher. I wouldn't say that there is anything to hard , but because it is a delivery job traffic can be a problem . What I enjoy the most is the freedom of the job routing and planning my own work day . I learned to always smile and be polite and treat everyone with respect and even if you make a mistake as long as your respectful and apologize and correct the problem you have a costumer for life ."
good,"Amazon was the best work place i have experienced,as it was my first job,the work atmosphere satisfied me."

good,"So far this has been a great company to work for, knowing that I can answer any questions a customer may have and each phone call ending with the customer satisfied makes me feel happy."
good,"Amazon Fulfillment Services Ruskin (TPA1) was a great place to work for.  They will work you to the bone with many heavy lifting and manual work positions and a lot of mandatory overtime, and volume of packages often overflows the conveyor belts and docks and you can do nothing but cope with what you can and make your numbers, but you do get all the help and tools you need to do your job well and be satisfied with it. They absolutely get slammed during peak season and despite a standard, in-place system, machines and facilities do get overwhelmed, there is just no way around it, Christmas volume is Christmas volume at Amazon. If you thrive under these conditions and love to work hard, you will do well."
good,"Its a nice environment to work. typically a four to five hour work day. Here, you learn how to sort each package to its correct pallet by zip code. you will then scan that package and place it on its pallet. Most of the management team are very helpful and doesn't mind providing guidance. It is very enjoyable to work here when everyone puts in the work needed and work together as a team."

I learned a lot about lighting for product photography, which has helped me improve my photography skills. I also learned how to improve my time management skills since being efficient is one of the most important parts of the job. My coworkers were very helpful and answered any questions I had, so I learned a lot from them, as well. The hardest part of the job was the commute since I lived an hour and a half away from work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do the kind of photography that I love to do."

good,I worked 10 hours a day 4 days a week.  I learned how to use a pallet jack manually.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the 3 days off.  It was hard at first getting use to the 10 hours a day.  We had 2 fifteen minutes breaks a day when we had peak season which we had to work 11 hours a day we would have 3 breaks.  I enjoyed the work when I did Inducts.  I had several managers and they were all every nice.

good,great office space with a multi lingual mix of colleagues. awesome company to work with. good management. work never felt difficult. always allowed room for recreation.
good,It is a friendly place where you can be yourself and you will meet some really intresting people. But something i really noticed is that the people with more power and authority made it that all there buddies were with them and that they have the jobs they want and its a easy day for them which isnt really fair but hey what can i do. Other than that it was an amazing place and a great experince.
good,"Productivity pushes you to the limits everyday which makes you better great communication between managers & associates is great and getting better and helping others is the hi light of my day.

good,"A typical day here at Amazon was very fun and entertaining. The work environment was very warming from the very start. I learned a lot working with this company － I learned how to solve problems quickly and to multi-task quickly. Management was very helpful and reliable throughout my stay. Co-workers were also very reliable, more like a huge family. The hardest part of working here was, of course, working in fast pace. I caught on very quickly, but I thrived to solve every problem I encountered causing it to sometimes be a little stressful. I think the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to interact with all kinds of people around the world, different cultures and different countries. I never knew what would be next when the phone rang, every customer was different and had a different problem. I like helping people, so this job was more of a dream job for me. Sadly I had to leave on my own terms because of family/personal problems that I had going on. I recommend this job to anyone that is able to work fast pace and/or loves interacting with people."

good,Working for Amazon.com in a production role is the most fulfilling career I've had. Every week there are new ideas and goals for improving processes and personal development. A lack of cadence is actually welcome but we also stick to tried-and-true methodologies to deliver to our customers on time and exceed their expectations. Stress levels are only high due to the feeling of wanting to excel on a day-to-day basis.

In a short time period i made some training's for picking, rebin and process guide. It was a very busy place in December and a lot of people working on a temporary contract just like me so maybe that's why the management could't handle all the requests.

The job was not hard at all but getting to work was taking me more than two hours.The best thing there was the fact i had discount's for the products."

Everyone there were incredibly friendly and helpful from my co-workers to the management, honestly nothing was ever too hard because I had the help of everyone there and the most enjoyable part of this job is the people. You could be working a 5 hour shift but it would only feel like you worked two, times just fly's when working at Amazon."
good,I enjoyed working for amazon its a fun fast paced work place you meet lots of awesome people and its just a overall great place to work.
good,"I had the privilege to work at Amazon Baltimore location when it opened its doors Oct '14.  Its a typical warehouse moving several boxes, but its not a strict environment nor are they hardcore about production numbers.  If you show up to work, have a great attitude, and work hard, your managers take notice.  This job was easy and perfect 4 hour job to supplement my day job income.  During peak season (late November-end of December), you can work up to 60 hours and win great prizes like flat screens and I-pods.  The downside is there are no benefits.  But I now transferred to the fulfillment center and happy there, too."

good,The workplace is very noise. The co-workers are friendly and I've learned that I can stand and walk a lot in one day. The hardest part of the job is that you have to walk at least 15 miles every day and your feet really start to hurt if you don't have on the proper footwear.
good,"Very professional environment and friendly people. I like the motto ""work hard, have fun and make history"". I can honestly say that was the vibe."
good,Amazon is an extremely fast paced work environment where you must give your best night in and night out in order to keep up with work standards. I have nothing but positive remarks regarding the management who create a positive and fun workplace. During my time at amazon my peers mad the hours move along much faster and with a plethora of personalities and entertaining individuals this was also the best part of the job. The hardest part about the job was that the amount of work to meet quota and the amount of work available did not always line up.
good,All associates knew each other by name and all took pride in work. Made the work experience easy to get the job done and have a good time. The managers were very respectful and the PAs were easy to talk to if there was ever an issue we knew who to go to with ease.

Being a part of the Amazon family is just as the name describes...A Family. They definitely go out their way to make sure its employees are treated fairly and with respect. They even provided flu shots and a Thanksgiving meal in November. I enjoy the people. The work is simple, yet demands to be approached and handled with care."

Management was great helped me with a lot keep employees busy and days went faster. the hardest part of the job is that I worked overnight had to make sure I had plenty of energy and rest to make it through the 10 hour shifts.

good,"premesso che, da ex lavoratore autonoma è stata la mia prima esperienza da lavoratore dipendente, sono rimasta favorevolmente colpita dall'organizzazione, precisione e disponibilità (dal punto di vista umano) dell'ambiente lavorativo, sia x i superiori che i colleghi medesimi. la parte più difficile è stato apprendere la standardizzazione del lavoro richiesta, ma dopo pochi giorni non è stato un problema; la parte piacevole è stata rapportarsi con i colleghi aventi ognuno un bagaglio di esperienze diverse."

good,Working for Amazon is not for lazy people.  If you like to work and keep moving this is a good job.  The Amazoniens ( full time permanent employees )  say the benefits are above average.   Everyone is friendly and want you to be successful. Amazon provides your safety equipment at not expense to you.   There is onsite care for any minor injury you may sustain while working.  There are 2 large break areas for lunch.  And there is a smoking lounge on site for you smokers.

Along with learning the Trailer Dock and Release Safety procedure. as well obtaining exceptional people skills and gaining experience in a leadership role. Management at Amazon was quite exceptional all supervisors and managers alike was patient, kind, and explained every task with great detail. My co-workers was ideal making life long friends along with amazing colleges at work has not been a subject i am unexperienced to. the hardest part of the job would have to be the seasonal time period when productivity was at a all time high for seasons and many many orders had to be filled out. the most enjoyable part of the job was actually all day majority of the day as cliche as that sounds its true Amazon is an ideal place to work at besides the constant layoffs."

It is a good job if you want a temporary job, but they only offer a few full time positions. The hardest part of the job is standing for 10 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the rewards for doing a good job ($20 gas cards, etc..)."
good,"At Amazon I was a stower, so basically I used a scanning gun, scanned items and out them onto shelves. I had the best co-workers. The hardest part about my job was to keep up with the rate they wanted us to be at and there not being any space to store really big items."
good,"The experience at Amazon was excellent.  The operation within the company was incredibly smooth and well organized, especially considering the enormous amount of product coming in and going out of the facility all the time.  Even more impressive was how helpful and appreciative the management was and it rubbed of on the other employees.  The team work was outstanding throughout the entire facility and the communication between the various departments created an environment where everyone feels they are playing a key part of the operation."

good,The company ws very supportive and helpful. management treated their associates great.
good,"Building was big while stocking. But they expected to fast of a rate. There was too many things to stock and not enough spaces to stock. Even when I was stocking shoes in an open area, I was doing almost twice as much as everyone else and I was below average with the threat of being let go. And those people had been there for several months or even years. How could I be too slow working for the same people when they have people standing around not doind anything with jobs??"

good,I am currently a Process Assistant. I enjoy my job but looking for something more. I have been with the company for almost 8 years total time and I am looking to utilize my knowledge and experience at a higher level.
good,"Working at Amazon is a great method to learn all aspects of management.  Amazon will help you with time management at work, this is something you learn early on as an area manager at Amazon.  A typical day for an area manager is to drive a safe environment where associates feel like owners of the organization. Area managers are also in charge of the quality and productivity metrics that are met in the fulfillment center.  The management at Amazon does follow one of the core values ""insist on the highest standards"" which is clear when viewing actual vs. expected metrics.   The hardest part of the job at amazon is receiving support from support functions within the distribution center. My favorite part of the job is working on process improvement projects with finance and the process improvement teams."
good,"Amazon.com was a great place to work. I took phone calls pertaining to Kindle tech support and assisted customers with their needs. Over my time at Amazon, I learned how to be a better speaker with customers, and how to better explain myself without being face-to-face with them. The management was great, and was always helpful. The co-workers were fantastic. The hardest part of the job was explaining to somebody over the phone just how to get something accomplished on the website, especially if they didn't know a lot about computers. In a way, that was also the most enjoyable part of the job, because when you could help them, that was what it was all about."

We took pride in our work, quality control, and production. The group that I was with, we were part of the original ones in the door, we beat records, and received good write ups, we were asked to be Ambassadors which are trainers, that train the integrity staffing people to help us get the production for the peak season (christmas) out the door and into the customers hands in time. We made friends, and enjoyed working together, sad when we started to go our seperate ways to other jobs, and as for me back to my home state. The most enjoyable part of this job is my friends and I rocked numbers and we competed with each other to see what our numbers for each day would be. I miss my friends, and some of the managers that we had. I had a wonderful experience with Amazon.com, it started to go down hill when they started hiring managers right out of college that had no idea what they were getting into, this was sad, and it cost them some really good managers that were more experienced and workers that knew what they were doing."

good,A typical work day included picking/packing a variety of items for customer's orders. I learned how to work independently while being part of a great team at the same time. I became stronger through the daily observations that where performed on the warehouse associates. The hardest part of the job was balancing life and work. I worked the night shift and it drowned me. I only wanted to sleep and work because of the intense work that was done from 6pm-6am. The most enjoyable part was being part of the team.
good,"- Une journée qui débute à 5h40 du matin et qui se termine à 13h00 de l'après-midi."

good,"I enjoyed working with others, fast pace, co-workers and management were very helpful when I was in training, the hardest part of the job was being cautious while throwing the linen into the laundry bags because we had to make sure there weren't any needles in the sheets and other linen and there was blood so we didn't want to get that on us either."
good,Enjoyed the fast paced work and constant push from co workers/management. I learned to keep trying to achieve my goal no matter how big if I put my all into it I could acheive above average. Hardest paert would have been learning to work with the computer or printer when it was running slower than I was working. I enjoyed the most being able to take care of my son with every pay check and feeling like my hard work made a difference and help set records for the company.
good,"Picking Items in large carts, traveling the items to the packers to get ready for shipments, and keeping up with rate."
good,Long 10hour work shifts only 30 min lunch and 2 15min break nice place to work. You must reach the rate of 100 percent each night or you get a write up. Alot of walking and standing the whole shift 12 to 15 miles of walking each night. Very easy job
good,Amazon has a really good atmosphere to work in. It's a company that values their employees and the employees love their job.

good,"I loved my work schedule, I loved my managers they were always very involved in helping you to reach your goal on any thing you wanted to achieve. It was very fun and upbeat. You were never board. The only thing I didn't like about it was how bad my body felt after a four day run working ten hour shifts."
good,Amazon is a good company to work for.  The job is physical and there is not much down time.  Amazon is willing to help employees meet their goals. They also offer career services advancement opportunities.
good,I love working here. The management and my coworkers are amazing. I actually enjoy going to work every day! A typical day starts at 2am. I have learned what it takes behind the scenes to get our packages in 2 days. It makes me appreciate the workers and drivers a little more each day.

good,"I worked in their warehouse, receiving incoming packages, and getting them ready to be shipped out to the customers. It was an enjoyable experience, and the demands of the workplace were reasonable. If I had to pick one thing that could've been improved, it was communication. You would sometimes have different managers telling you to do different things at the same time, but getting both tasks done within a reasonable time frame was rarely an issue."
good,A typical work day we unloaded the trailer full of merchandise and sorter through it getting ready to ship it out the day of or the following days to the customers

I worked outside pushing carts containing packages and directing traffic of vehicles.   A lot of physical labor because carts are heavy and the sun giving me a tan but they provide water and sunscreen stations. But for how much an hour I got paid, it was all worth it.

Amazon gave me every chance to reapply for other positions, however, positions just didn't open up soon enough."

good,"I have been working from home with Amazon for two years now. My daughter has been by my side ever since I started. It’s save me so much money on daycare until she starts school. The benefits are great. I have health, dental, vision 401(k), life insurance and more. I work a four day shift for 10 hours. I have two 15 minute breaks that are paid and one 45 minute lunch break that is not paid. I am off Tuesday Wednesday and Saturday. We change our shifts every three months now depending on the workflow. Some holidays are mandatory, however, there is a thing called VTO that they will put out , So you can take it and it doesn’t count against you. We also get paid time off and unpaid time off and vacation that is accrued every time we get paid and every half the year. They are not counted against you  if you use it to take off. Amazon is just a great place to be at. I would never trade them for anything. I’m really glad they are building a fulfillment center down the street from me"
good,"A company that gives great job opportunities. Although there is a rate required to meet, it is a steady paced environment. The company gives you pretty good benefits."
good,The work was good and people were very friendly and helpful to all the coworker and it was a enjoyable part of the jobs and i would learn alot about picking.

Being young and new to the working life, they helped me a lot when gaining confidence. They always try and make the atmosphere fun and happy which shows that they really do want to make a tough job, enjoyable as well. The salary is very good and I always considered it as a bonus. Overall I really enjoyed it."
good,I enjoyed my time at amazon. Packing was fast paced but the time passed by quickly. I learned more than just packing. I was trained to do the packing machine and also problem solve. As long as you show good work ethic then they will train you all over the place. I enjoyed this part because I was able to see different things every day and it wasn't always the same thing.
good,"I was a seasonal trainer. The support you get from the managers is amazing. The work environment is amazing and very fast paced. If you do not mind working hard, it is a great place to work."
good,"Put a lot emphasis on quality and production, if did not meet standards, written up.  it is very fast paced and working four 10 hour days and having 3 off, was very nice."
good,"Typical day Starts with finding the associated work process given by the manager. I have learnt a lot from the process that i have worked at. Working with the big team and attending meetings daily helped me learn a lot to learn about the process implemented in Amazon, inc. The work culture was liberal and fun. The hardest part of the job was working on finding the errors in the work process itself (which can exceed more than 1000 errors). Every part of the process was enjoyable in the job."
good,"It is a wonderful place to work, sometimes things can get a bit hectic around the holiday season, but if you stick it out through that you have an amazing job and an amazing team to work with."

good,"I enjoy working at Amazon.Fast past, being able to get extra hours before others beat you to the hours, good work place culture, the hardest part of the job is not knowing if your going to be able to work your whole full shift until you get to work an they tell you your only going to work for three hours or two. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that your getting paid and the work is not hard labor."

good,"I enjoyed the company and their employees I worked with, great envionment. I would definitely return to the  company and recommend this job to anyone."
good,Amazon customer service is a great position to work! The work from home position was awesome and very flexible and great for anyone that prefer being in the comfort of their own home while working. I enjoyed being able to chose my hours using the shift bid tool. Amazon is one of the largest retail online shopping stores and is a very profitable company!
good,"Amazon has wonderful stories of employees who started at the bottom and moved all the way up! Fun casual culture that also gets results! The typical day at work consists of writing reports, ensuring employees are on task, and communicating with senior leaders regarding status updates on the shift."
good,"would love to work here again, loved coming into work knowing my routine, how to help others and make the job go swell and a lot faster for myself and others, breakrooms were well kept, bathrooms too! 5/5 great work place!"
good,This is a work from home position. I never feel like I'm alone because there are other people on my team. We communicate through chat rooms. I take customer phone calls for our Amazon Logistics dept and I deal with deliveries that didn't make to the customer or delayed. I absolutely LOVE my job!  :-)
good,"Best place to work at, no micro management. best Team Leads I have ever seen in my life. "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working in the DLA5 in Riverside between the months of August 2018 and January 2019. I was able to convert to a permanent employee after a short time. My supervisors and managers were great and the people I worked with were friendly and there was a sense of camaraderie among many of the people I worked with. Unfortunately, I had to voluntarily resign because I was not granted an extended leave of absence for personal time off. I understand the policy of the company and that I had not worked there long enough to qualify for the leave of absence. I hope to be rehired as soon as possible when there is an opening in the same facility."
good,If anyone wants to go and work there I would tell them to work there. The people make it easy to do this things.But you have to be very fast if they will let you go fast.
good,"Amazon je velice dobrý pracovní odrazový můstek, pro pracovní pozice v dalších logistických skladech, jako je  Amazon. V Amazonu jsou různé pozice kterými prochází skoro každý zaměstnanec. Je to dobře, protože být univerzální má veľké výhody. Naučit se vše co Amazon dává a nabízí. Tak proč toho nevyužít, když toto Máme všechno v našich rukách  😉. Je to zábavná práce kde navíc hraje hudba k motivaci zaměstnance Amazonu. Práce je nenáročná a snadná i s úsměvem 😊☺☺.Děkuji Všem Amazoňákům a užijte si hezké chvíle. PS : STOJÍ TO ZA VŠE CO PRO SEBE V AMAZONU DĚLÁTE A NAOPAK😉 ☺"

good,"Very considerate of associates and good place to work, Amazon take cares of there associates. Management was the best and there where no hard parts to the job."
good,"Had a blast working here. Great pay, great benefits, great advancement opportunities. Would always recommend for employment. If you can stick it out past peak, pretty smooth sailing. You have to make yourself recognized though, or you may be on the chopping block after due to being a seasonal employee."
good,It’s a good job but it’s  A lot of standing in a lot of walking and you must be out of work for 8 to 10 hours a day but the pay is really good you get paid every two weeks
good,"I ship boxes from 7am to 2;30 pm"
good,"Absolutely loved working here! The management was always open t to you ideas. If you work hard you will definitely be recognized for it, and not just by your peers, but senior management as well.

good,"Work was a creative workplace. I enjoyed my job very much."
good,I loved working for Amazon I loved the people I lived picking items the payrate was great benefits was good I love that you can receive a percentage of Amazon stock
good,"A typical work day starts off with standup where they make general announcements, give information about the volume for the day and do stretches.  I have learned the job is not too hard and you may move around to different areas in one shift.  The management can change quite a bit although quality is fairly consistent.  The culture is very relaxed and if you are in an area with other associates communication and socializing white working is possible.  The hardest part of the job is when others choose to make it harder on everyone else.  I enjoy the fact that supervisors are not breathing down your neck as long as you do your job properly."
good,Amazon is one of the most leading e-commerce company with a fun working environment and its a pleasure to work for Amazon.They management is at its best.
good,Working at Amazon is a place where individuals stay motivated by their peers. Great place to work and build relationships. Working at amazon you are always welcomed with a team meeting which allows us to know the names of other associates who may work i other departments. I learned a lot scanning.The managers are like hype men that keep pumping you up with inspiration.
good,"Equal treatment to all the employees is the key feature I like about this company."
good,"Hard working, intelligent, motivated and compassionate managers are in charge of my team!  Love the working environment, the fast pace, the integrity and level of teamwork that most of my team members provide!"

good,"Turni dalle 06.00 alle 00.00"
good,Fast paced they keep you moving.but overall there it was a good experience working with Amazon i just wished i could keeping working for them even though it was a temp job I really liked it and i wished i could have got converted over.
good,"As long as you do your job (which you are trained and the job is pretty easy) everything is smooth. It's not hard, just keep a level head, know what you came there to doe, ask questions if you need help, and enjoy the amazing people that work there. It helps the time pass"

good,I really do enjoy working at Amazon. Benefits  and the extras are great. The manager and staff are respectful and understanding. Amazon will work around your schedule with school and those who have children.
good,"work hard, have fun, make history"
good,"This facility is a little different from what I’m use to. People are always moving at a fast pace, and there are a lot of employees in the same space or going to the same spot. It’s more like, pay attention and hurry up cause you don’t have much time to get to where you’re going. The lunch room is always clean, machines are usually filled with products and the bathrooms are clean, but again you don’t spend a lot of time in either of these areas. Very fast paced"
good,i really enjoyed working for the  Amazon. I wish I did not have to relocate to Michigan to help care for my mother and father in law that had health problems.
good,"Outstanding training, and comfortable work place. Amazon treats their employees with respect and gives them everything they need that amazon can provide."
good,Amazon was a great place to work a lot of people complained about all the walking but I'm a person who love to work so the consistent cardio was a great way to work out and work at the same time. As a stower the job was not hard at all the only thing is that you have to at least maintain a rate of 100% by the end of everyday but once you raised your rate more than an 100% you will have to keep it higher than 100%. the work is so easy you would beg for overtime.
good,"Lots of (paid) training provided, though it is a lot of information to take in. As a CSA, you're dealing with all sorts of issues over the phone & you're encouraged to solve these as quickly as possible. The only thing I truly disliked about the company is you're not allowed to escalate unless the customer specifically asks to be escalated to a Manager, no matter what the issue is."
good,"Bon travail,  travail d'équipe et très bonne ambiance"
good,great place to work. great benfits and fun envirmoment. It is very physical job but the plus side is you loose weight with how much you are moving. I would go back if the hours worked better for my schedule.
good,Working there is full of fun as everyone enjoys working there and learn many things and gain good experiences.while working there i saw many new products and I learned how to scan products.our manager is very nice and tell us about many things.It got good cafeteria where i can sit and eat. They got big car parking so i can park my car easily.overall it is good place to work.
good,"I had a good experience in amazon. Very soon I have completed my bachelor's I have entered in to a corporate world, though I worked in a different stream and the time span is also very less as I had planned to continue my education in Master of information technology in Australia, I left it and came and completed my masters with a good grade."
good,We had long shifts but amazon carried a culture and an expectation that we all held ourselves to. Working for Amazon also was a great experience because I received skills that I can carry with me along the way.
good,"People very friendly , people are very friendly pay is good hours was fine , 10 hours wasnt bad at all to Me we had 3 lunch breaks the work was very easy"

good,Working at Amazon Fashion was a great experience. The workplace was very friendly and they took good care of people who they worked with. The management was really helpful and made sure that we had everything we needed.
good,"My typical day at Amazon was a great day, I loved the people they were all understanding and helpful to others. I learned how to go throught the warehouse to get oders that was being packed up to be sent to customers. I also learned how to pack big orders that were being sent off to stores foe sale. The culture at Amazon, their were all cultures there. The hardest part about the job was, well there wasnt any. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you meet new people and you all know that your station has completed your quota for the day."
good,I like what I do as a receiving clerk. Scanning inbound products. My job is easy. My work site is great. My managers are great. Overall a good experience.
good,"I love working for Amazon. It challenges you and sometimes it can feel overwhelming but at the end, you feel accomplished. It was a lot of data entry for the position that I'm in. It's all about the customer and being a customer myself that's good to know."
good,it was my first job and it was honestly very easy. people there are nice literally everyone was nice. had a blast. sometimes would get overwhelmed due to how things work there and depending on the time of year but an overall great place to work.
good,"You just need to know which locations to work at.  Sort centers are only part time and MUCH better than fulfillment centers.  You get the same pay for less strenuous work and more flexible schedules.  The environment in my location is very relaxed.  We are encouraged to have fun daily and are included in various activities and are often given snacks, drinks, etc.  Most people have great personalities and make you look forward to coming into work every day.  Also, sort centers hours ""flex"" up or down (0 mins to 1 hr) based on the volume of packages.  If we flex down for a shift or multiple shift and our hours turn out to be less than we were scheduled, if we show up for every one of our shifts we get guaranteed pay for the hours we were scheduled but didn't make due to volume."
good,"Consistent training to keep you up to par with your responsibilities.  Great group of people. Alot of positive activities,  employee appreciation,  good culture."
good,Works Amazon part time off loading trailers as well as scanning orders from trailers coming into the property for local distribution to customers. A great place  to work.
good,"I had a real good experience in the organisation. I have learnt different tasks everyday and how to handle them. The work culture was amazing. The hardest part of the job was to convince the customers but it is all part and parcel of our work, we become more skilled and tuned to it. It gave me immense patience and taught me wonderful things to grow up in the society to be a good human being."
good,"was a clean, straightforward work environment with excellent management and company goals that appreciated hard work and internal growth. Would have loved to stay, but home life took over for the time being. I would definitely recommend a job with Amazon to my friends and family if given the chance."
good,You had to work fast and safety to scan the work into the system and load stuff from off the truck so it could proceed to further actions of getting shipped
good,Amazon had excellent managers that aimed to help me better myself not only as an employee but as a person. Best work environment I have ever been a part of!
good,Plenty of chances for advancement if you work hard you will get noticed I did and after only seven weeks with the company I was asked to be a stow instructor did my training in a night and am now ready to instruct new hires
good,Productive workplace. Fast pace and you are working closely with other people. Overall it is a very good place to work at Amazon. If you are looking for part work; Amazon is the place to be.
good,People are meet their work demands (which is quite achievable) and are provided with multiple opportunities and roles without your work getting hampered.
good,I enjoyed working around a lot of people in a warehouse. fast paced but it was also very safe. the training helped me in my overall work there. my supervisors were very polite friendly and responded to any of my questions accurately. it was also a very clean work environment.
good,I absolutely loved working here and was sad when I had to leave. The work is very fast-paced and physically demanding but it helps the time go by fast.
good,"i like the competitive atmosphere helps production move faster when working next to someone "
good,"Amazon is a great place to work. The environment is great. Management and HR were amazing and work with you when you're having trouble (at work or home). I really felt like they care for me. The fast paced work environment keeps you busy and in good physical shape. The people at Amazon also have a medical clinic in the facility, so any injury or illness can be dealt with accordingly."
good,"You have to physically prepare but the job is so worth it I’m in day 3 and as for my building i advise anybody ready to work and be part of a good company that actually cares for their workers "
good,"Great managers that CAN take the stress.  The job is fun, but you have no time to goof-off.  So, if you are a team player and like winning, working, and making bonuses plus great benefits, Amazon has a great career plan for you. There is still plenty of places to go and people to serve. Advancement from within is encouraged.  It's all here for the ambitious....grab it!"
good,"I love my amazon! The management and coworkers are friends I’ll have for a lifetime! I’m very thankful I decided to work at Amazon. They are also paying for me to get my cdl license, so I’m excited!"
good,"Environnement agréable, le management est pas mal."
good,In the fast pased growth of Amazon there is a job for everyone! Super easy to get your foot in the door amd amazing opportunities for advancement and lateral moves!
good,It was very helpful work environment to improve my skills. I enjoy to do work.Everyone was very helpful. I came to know about new ways to the work in organized manner.
good,"This is a great place to work, fast paced, you can zone out and do your work, then the day is over before you know it.  The culture's great, they have group stretching and safety lessons, and come by frequently to make sure you're doing well."
good,"Nice place to work... good pay"
good,"The hourly rate is not terrible as it pays more per hour than some automotive plants do at start. Health benefits begin day 1, and that is worth the low pay in and of itself. The work is easy but will require you to stand for 9 of the 10 hours per day that you work."
good,Really enjoyed working at Amazon's Customer service center in Huntington WV. Very employee friendly environment. Solid pay and benefits backed by a very friendly management staff.
good,A good place to work with supportive managers. The company provides additional bonus for associates who uses their own commute to office. Overall best place to work.
good,"This is an Excellent company with extraordinary  working environment. Less pressure. Good Learning and its all self learning there which help us to understand the concept in our own unique way."
good,"Everything is good if you work. So many lazy people that just complain. Really it is a good place to work and people can move up and almost all leaders in all departments will help with it, all you have to do is ask and do what you ask for. Most bad reviews are from people who are unable to or willing to work. Don’t take this wrong, there are plenty of people there happy with just making rate and talking all day and complaining. So it is a job anyone that just wants to get by and never progress but it is a place that will take care of you if you want to move up and on to better positions. There is people that got a raw deal because time ran out but mostly people complaining just need reasons and blame for their own incompetence and lack of trying."
good,i enjoyed working for amazon fresh very fun place .. very good money .breaks where good enough enough hours a week .. i would go back and do it all over again
good,I love working there but I need a closer work place where I live.I work there for three an half years so It was time for me to try new things. They have benefits too.
good,It was a nice and relaxed place to work. it made you the boss. Meaning your hard work will pay off if your willing to work. A great motivating place to work.
good,"Its a very flexible company. There is a lot of opportunity for overtime and advancement. The work gets tiring, but if you save your UPT you can leave on the days that you aren't comfortable working. They pay better than most warehouse companies in the area and provide health and educational benefits."
good,amazon was a great place to work. the work day was not too long and there was always something to do. i used to unload the trucks which would take up most of the day. they also provided ample amount of overtime
good,Don't really have much to say but amazon is the best place to start a career and excel to other levels in higher areas of works. its very great to experience the culture in amazon.
good,Everyday was always a new task and new goal. Our management team made sure to push us to our fullest potential to provide great customer service and feedback.
good,"It is probably the best place to work, full benefits, free transport to and from work, and the greatest of people to work with! The higher ups communicate everything constantly and you are never left in he dark, you feel happy and secure in your job always and they are always looking to push you to be better and move up in your role at Amazon."
good,"It all matters which team and department you work in.  If you have the skills to cut it, Amazon is a great place to advance your career.  Lots of opportunity to improve the business and improve skills in your background."
good,"Hard work "
good,"Been with Amazon for over 4 years and one thing I can say that the tuition reimbursement program is great; with the company paying over 90% of your yearly tuition from 1 years worth of employment."
good,"It was a very engaging work environment. The managers made sure we were getting our work done while having fun and getting enough breaks, etc.  Management is easy to talk and somewhat flexible when things come up or you need time off. The hardest part of the job is the holidays because of the volume that you get at each warehouse."
good,"Amazon was the best employer I could ask for. I had a great team, fun job and amazing salary and benefits."
good,"The work culture of Amazon is really amazing. There is a standard hierarchy of reporting and the issues which were reported in the workplace were immediately addressed. On the whole, it was a fun environment to work."

good,Azienda molto seria e ben organizzata. Ambiente di lavoro con particolare attenzione alla sicurezza.
good,i was always happy there. everybody seemed to want to help out. with only one picker allowed in the aisle you would have to loop back around. when dropping off the cage people always seemed positive.

good,Amazon is a great company to work for. They treat you how a worker should ALWAYS be treated. I love that they have 3 giant break rooms so your not crammed in there on your break.
good,"Amazing Amazon is nice and great company to work, I use to be a full time associate and my manager was very nice and human, now i work part time since couple weeks"
good,"I was able to work from home in a virtual environment, which was really great. If you needed help with an issue, it was just a click away. Paid training and the best benefits I've ever had. The only downfall to working there is that you would be transferred to another department based on business need. They offered a buy out after peak season and after 6 plus years, I took the buyout. I wasn't happy with my current position and took buyout. It was a pretty good work culture and even though it was a virtual position, you still got to have work friends. Most managers were really good to work with Overall, it was a pretty sweet place to work!"
good,"First off the benefits they offer is great considering you get them day one and dont have to wait 90 days like many companies. There is a lot of room for advancement. So far i am liking the job, hopefully i can improve and move up."
good,I used to work at Amazon and it was the easiest job I've ever worked. The people you work with are very nice and make the day go by fast. The managers were very kind and actually cared about the employees.
good,"Management is there to answer questions and help in various situations. They are kind and supportive as is the rest of the team, and are especially patient and to newbies."
good,"Fun place to work, I was happy to work in a fast paced work environment. I have learned how to plan and manage your time."

good,"very friendly workers, teamwork, respect each other, quick paces work, load and unload from pallets and scan the invetory also very psyical work along long hour stands"
good,"Lot of new stuff going on every day hence lots of opportunities to look around."
good,"It's the perfect job for any individual who comes to work ''  TO - WORK "". I personally liked  working their because , as an Order Picker / Packer, I was responsible for my own work and if I filed up the job ,  I would bare that burden solely upon myself ."
good,"Amazon.com was one of the best jobs I have ever had. I went from being a Security Officer, to being a Safety and Security Associate, and then to being a Shift Supervisor. I built many skills, made any friends, and really enjoyed working there."
good,"Amazon is like a big family. But the salary is little bit lower in the industry. Most of the time, you don't need to work over time. But you have to be on call..."
good,Always day one at amazon.. I will miss working here and the people i met.  Safety was priority.  Being a water spider most enjoyable part of the job. Once again Safety was big and we wanted you to leave as you came.

It was a little difficult being thrown into an environment where I knew no one and was expected to provide feedback and solve personal problems.

The job was a fast pace job that I love because it keeps me busy. The management was good people and they are very understanding and will work with you. the hardest part of the job was when a lot of people quit and didn't come to work, so I will have to come in on my off days and I had to cancel all my plans."

good,"amazon is a very good place to work , even with it is a fast working place but the job is not not stressful at all and the leadership is making it easier on the associates ,"
good,"All levels of management make it a point to know associate's names and remind everyone they are available to talk anytime, anyplace, and about anything. The inbound contacts can get insanely busy and they are extremely metrics driven. You MUST be 100% every contact everyday and meet metrics 100% before being considered eligible for promotion or cross training in other areas. The least controllable metrics for associates are what are held in the highest regard by management."
good,Working at Amazon was fun and fast paced.  Unfortunately I received an injury not on the job and I was let go from my position.  However I enjoyed my employment and there was plenty of advancement opportunities.  The management was very pleasant and only wanted us to succeed.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that it was a fast paced work environment but it was also the most enjoyable part of the work.
good,"A typical day at Amazon is at the same time stressful, fun, and fast paced. But everyday you learn something new. So for all future Amazonians, Work Hard. Have Fun. Make History."
good,"I loved working at amazon, great environment to be in and great people to be around. the most enjoyable part of the day was actually just walking into the building  the managers are great to he around and very helpful with anything you may need help with."

good,"It was a great work experience. Have to be ready to work those hours, in a fast pace setting, standing and moving for 12 hours. "
good,"Working quickly and heavy lifting required. Opportunities to move around from day to day so being stuck in the same position each day is rare. Open communication link to management for any issues. Competitive environment is encouraged by measuring individual stow rates. Small learning curve, but easy to master. 15 minute paid break each day, and each shift starts with 15 minute stand-up meeting (30 minutes paid with minimal work each day). Work revolves around conveyor belt and stowing packages."
good,"Amazon was an amazing company to work for! They expressed teamwork, love for the employees and putting the customer first everyday! My work days were enthusiastic and fun… awesome team to work with."
good,In my last 5 years i learned a lot at amazon. from building up the new fulfillment center to supporting the daily Business of our internal customers. i also had the chance to work for operations.

good,"While I worked here, i had plenty of friendly and helpful co-workers and supervisors. However nobody was perfect just like any other job. However, the main selling point of this review is that if you want to make hours and therefore bigger paychecks, then apply here today. They will work you hard but those checks are gonna make you smile just like their packing boxes."
good,It was a different but good experience. I would recommend this job to anyone that is willing to work. I think that amazon is a great company that gives people the opportunity to show off their great working skills from packing to picking and sorting. One of the things that I do not mind is how amazon does not discriminate against any one from the elderly to people who have disabilities or that are pregnant I enjoyed my time while I was there
good,The workplace is fun and competitive. If you work hard you can get special items for it. The hardest part of the job is just getting a system that works for you. When you are packing.

good,"From when the shift starts at 7:30 am,until your first break at 11 am your morning could seem like it's going by really slow. Once you get your first break and get a moment to replenish,you will be in better shape for the rest of your shift than you were the beginning. By your second break at 3 pm,you get more relaxed because after your break there's only 2 and a half hours until your shift ends. I've never felt more relieved and accomplished after ending a shift at Amazon. It's a challenging environment,but if you can make it through;you will feel confident in your work ethic."
good,Amazon's work environment was one of the best i have ever been in. They treated their staff really good. Had a really good pay rate. Enjoyed their flexible hours.
good,"I liked working with Amazon. It was fast paced, made time go by and it was always a give away for pto everyday(power hour). Great lunch to fill you up and have you ready to finish the second half."

November-December is peak season and is intense, but you get +20 hours of overtime every week. When I was at my 2-3 month mark, I was already starting to train new people for peak season, and was inclined for a tier 3 promotion, but it didn't happen for personal reasons. I was apart of a new building launch, and because of this, there was mass hiring, which made things unorganized and things messed up a lot, but it was still worth it. I would definitely work here again, if I had the opportunity."

At Amazon Customer Service, we dealt with customers who contact us regarding their pre-purchase, post-purchase and during several other inquiries.

Thinking outside the box and coming up with new ideas is valued here.My favorite part about working here has been having the chance to explore area's I'm curious about, it's how I learned to create a Wiki page and became interested in computer engineering/programming.

Work place was filled with nice and kind people. If i had a question i could ask a person around me or supervisor and i would always get an answer.The hardest part of job was standing still on the concert floor because my legs would get stiff and my feet sore.

There plenty of opportunity to add more hours to your shift so that was great too.

good,"Amazon Fresh is new to the Atlanta Area and is still getting loose ends tightened but since opening day business has grown. We are an online grocery store, customers order their groceries online through the Amazon Fresh website and the associates pick and pack their groceries for delivery. That is the prime duty but when we have new freight in we do do stow or bin our freight, we also remove old and outdated items from the shelf to insure no customer receives spoiled or outdated groceries."
good,Fantastic work place with the most enthusiastic employees. Management team is constantly helping you to improve your work functions to be the most productive you can be!
good,A great place to get free PIT training. After a year of working there moving up is easy and encouraged. While moving up seems to be shoved down your throat it really is as simple as a year of work. Good management that is there to help you as well.

good,"Overall a great place to work. It was very easy to get hired on. I just filled out the application online, scheduled a time to go in when I got the invitation, and I was hired. No interview.You have to really be ready to work hard though, because it is a very physically demanding job. You constantly are lifting, squatting, walking fast, pulling packages of all sizes and weights from the conveyor belt, and then organizing and scanning them into their correct location, then running back to the belt to not miss pavkages going by. They have rate quotas for how many boxes you scan in, so you have to move at a quick pace otherwise they will ding you. The time flies by, and the job itself isn't hard (other than physically). Management is great. They often buy food for all the employees, give out gift cards, and do raffles for items like TVs, iPads, and laptops. The raffles may have just been for the holiday season, but it was a really nice gesture."
good,"Learned how to manage time efficiently."
good,"Great management and co-workers which makes a huge difference. Flexible schedule and provides a fun, fast-paced environment which makes the day fly by."

good,"benefits are great."
good,"enregistrement des factures, environnement agréable, les employées sont a l’écoute."
good,The three month internship at Amazon is one of the most demanding internships an MBA can have. The work culture is very supportive and collaborative and one works on very high value projects with network wide application.
good,This job was very fast pasted and very friendly . The work was easy and the people was nice . The benefits were great it was just the standing .
good,A typical day can be alot of walking. I've learn how to get around a warehouse and use scanner .I have never really had a experience with management its so busy there doing peak.

good,"In my time working at Amazon, I enjoyed the attitude of my co-workers and my job. I would recommend this job to anyone who would like a labor working job that pays decently well. Management was always respectful towards me and always had their act together; they were some of the best managers I have been around. I gained an abundant amount of experience working at Amazon Fulfillment. I was taught how to use an FBA scanner, fill up totes, work in a fast-pace environment, and so much more. On an average day I was expecting 10-12 hours of constant walking, bending, pushing, pulling, climbing, and lifting. I would also have to scan correct items in a tote or damage items that were broken into another bin. My overall view on the intensity of the job was the fast-pace walking and the most enjoyable was the benefits, pay, and co-workers."
good,"The virtual environment has allowed me to have a flexible schedule, be trained in numerous fields within the company, advance faster than ever, and communicate daily with people from all over the world to make the company the best it can possible be. "

good,"Amazon is one of the fastest growing companies in the world. The reason for this exponential growth is the start-up culture and the freedom that this company affords to its employees. I was able to built teams from ground up, make major changes, propose multiple process improvements in less than three months. "
good,"its hot and dirty and repetitive but it sure pays the bills they have a nice break room, and the people are very friendly unless you get Rob as a manager"
good,"Being a quality auditor for Amazon.com was a great job. Although it was sometimes repetitive warehouse work, I was always rewarded with great wages, challenging situations, and most importantly an unlimited opportunity for advancement. I was also inspired by a CEO that has a devotion for community, family, and the less fortunate. A humble man who wants to see the world improve. That simple idea provided me with motivation. This is a perfect example of a self-made man who started with a small garage operation and turned it into a huge success. The company also excels at the most important part of business, phenomenal customer service."
good,"The company will take care of its employees and it's fostered a very positive work culture, perhaps the best I've been part of."
good,"Amazon cares about the employees  "
good,The work culture at amazon is amazing. Great time in learning things and achieving heights. Good company to work especially to freshers having a greater experience.
good,The work here is fast paced but equally combined with fun and very good management.New tasks for you almost everyday and so much to learn.
good,"That was one of my best jobs . It was so refreshing to work with the staff and all the clients that attended our community. I would definitely go back if offered another position,."
good,Amazon is a fast paced warehouse.  I love work ing there because the time just flies by.  I took extra care of the products because I envisioned myself getting the packages and I would like nice and neat packages.
good,I worked night shifts and loved it. The management was a bit lacking but not a problem. It was a fun workplace filled with fun people and it was a great environment. Would love to work there again
good,Amazon is the place where you have fun at work . Also it is a place where we can see the rapid growth among the people working here. I got many opportunities to polish my skills. management is very friendly with employees.

good,"It was a good environment. The shifts can be quite long at times however, it is very good place to work at. I have learnt quite a bit while working there"
good,"Fast paced and very physical. Was hired with no experience and quickly gained a multi-faceted understanding of a loading dock, and time management. Was trained to dock and release trailers, drive powered industrial trucks, and depart drivers. "
good,"Gave away lots of electronics and lots of events for goals and accomplishments. lots of training is provided when time was availible. we woukd have holiday contest for prizes and some were just given away. kindels,ipod,gift cards, phones, tvs lots of things. They fed us a lot  of chick-fil-a,pizza hut, krispy kream, and we even had x-mas dinner party."
good,"Amazon.com has been the best place I have worked until date as the environment, the culture is very open and fresh. The support we received from our leads, mentors, managers has made me learn a lot in life and professional life."
good,"Amazon has THE BEST benefits package Ive ever been blessed with by an employer.  The HR staff goes above and beyond to help and answer any/all questions you have regarding your benefits, accrued time, payroll, etc.  This company takes care of its employees.  You DO have to work, and you ARE held accountable for your productivity, but the rewards are worth every drop of sweat you might have.  Co-workers are awesome.  Hardest part of the job is the fact you have to stand up the entire shift, and depending on your job title, you might also have to walk alot.  BUT...its a 4 day work week.  And you get PTO, UPT, and accrue vacation each paycheck.  Your benefits start on Day 1.  Attention to detail is a must, and if you're not one that likes to follow rules, this isnt the place for you.....such as no cell phones out on the floor, nothing but water at your station to drink, short breaks and 30 minute lunch which INCLUDES walking time from your station to the break room and BACK....and accountability for 'time off task'.  I hated to leave, but if they build a warehouse where I moved to, rest assured I will be back!"
good,"most enjoyable part was that everyone got along and worked hard to achieve daily goals."
good,It is fun to work with Amazon. Only Management is little issue.Overall amazing place and culture. Good Opportunity to start with your career.
good,"I would have to say that Amazon has one of the nicest warehouse's I've ever worked in, it's very spacious and neatly organized. While I was there everyone was very nice and enjoyable to work with."
good,"At amazon you work hard and have fun. Some days are harder than other but when you maintain an positive outlook it's never stressful. The managers are reasonable, and at the end of the day it's all about communication."
good,"I was in the ICQA department at an Amazon Fulfillment center. My job included maintaining constant updates of product inventory, and providing the data to my managers for them to implement and update the inventory on their end."
good,It's a good place to work. Very friendly and nice people working there.  Salary was good too. Hardest part is that you need to work really fast and make high productivity.
good,This job is the type of job that you have to be up and ready for. The pay and benefits is good. Also know that this is a big warehouse so you see many different faces or the same faces. Love to work for amazon. The hardest part about this job is that if you leave work you will have a hard time finding another parking spot.
good,"业务不接地气，不太符合中国消费者的习惯"
good,A healthy fun place with a balanced crowd with lot of young talents. Good place to work. Good place to start. good management with lot of experience to guide you.
good,"I take calls from amazon customers and assist them with their queries."
good,"I believe every day was a new adventure. We would do a different job each day. I loved learning new equipment, and learn new tasks. Our Managers where great, very reliable as well. The other team members where awesome, they would help you with any questions you may have, or help you with a new process. The hardest part of my day was trying to make sure we had all of our customer orders out in a timely manner."
good,"Jeder ist freundlich mit einander! Jeder kann sich dutzen, das fand ich am besten!"
good,"At this job the best days was when I worked in team cause I could learn new things. I also was happy about that job cause I was always busy. "
good,"Had to work in amazon German website - amazon.de"
good,"great followed protocol "
good,"its a very good place to work"
good,"I loved working for Amazon it was totally an experience working production and learning the in side and out of the company ,health insurance was a major plus but there was plenty of room to grow with the company"
good,"Best thing Amazon provides you , to be innovative and a good work environment. Proper work timings (max day shifts).And the good part no dress code."
good,"little bit hard to work if you do same job every day but amazon provides lot of new trainings so its very easy to work there."
good,"Pleasant work environment , managers always helpful and well trained, maximum safety measures for workers , free coffee breaks, low paid , but the paid transport to the location on time , work time 10:00 4 days a week"
good,"The day started with the Team Huddle where the team's performance of the week would be discussed and we were encouraged to speak about any best practices or any new learning."
good,First time working in a factory/warehouse and must admit it was a great experience. Sadly it was only temporary but would've loved a permanent job with them.
good,Nice environment to work. All managers are very co-operative and helpful with all employees as well as HR team. We are working as a team to complete any task.
good,"The Amazon Fulfillment Center in Coppell, TX is very organized and safe. I feel like the management truly cared about their employers and listened to any complaints. The management encouraged employers to vocalize their opinions and acknowledged their feedback."
good,"My typical day working at Amazon, I would have to say it was long, hard but worth the check if you really focus time flies, and the work is pretty fun."
good,respected people and easy to get on with. get paid on time. get treated equally. it can get depressing at times because of long hours but its good place to work
good,"My job assignment varies. Our warehouse is the last step before the packages are sent to the customer so we check the packages for damages or if they were sent to the wrong Amazon warehouse. After we clock in we have something called stand up. There we stretch, discuss safety tips, the volume for our shift, success stories, and any other information the manager(s) want to give the employees. The hardest part of the job is there aren't a lot of employees in our warehouse because our peak season is over. However we still receive a high amount of volume and there aren't enough people to get the volume scanned and out for shipping in a timely manner. Overall Amazon is all about having fun."
good,They are good company to work for and they have fun while you are working and have a good time they have fun with other little things to do and do power hours and you win stuff
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. They offered awesome benefits and everyone there was super friendly. i did not care for the peak season with mandatory overtime. it was just way to much time at work and not enough personal time. I enjoyed working with a wide verity of age and nationalities. I also enjoy the prizes that they had to offer.
good,"Lots of learning and challenging work, good working environment, helpful and knowledgeable co-workers."
good,"Nothing to say bad about this workplace "
good,Great opportunity to grow with hard work. Flexible  schedule and polite management. Teaches people to work as a team. Great commute for myself.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was just being there. I learned to use a rf scanner and to ship out objects. i challenged myself to get my work out before it was time for it to be out. i loved my co workers.
good,"Working for amazon was great. Everything was extremely well organised and you always knew where you were supposed to be and what you were supposed to be doing. The management here took a keen interest in every employee as an individual and did there best to cater to your personal needs to the point you could even have a fan given to you if you were too hot. I learned alot about the running of a warehouse whilst employed by amazon, aswell as health and safety. There wasn't really a hard part of this job as everything ran so smoothly. The best part of this job was working to a dead line as a team and achieving it."
good,"Since I stowed items I had to move very quickly or my ratings would drop. Amazon requires a person to be strong, fast, and motivated. A typical day at work is group in the morning where we stretch and know which station we work that day. We had three breaks throughout the 10 hour day. My co-workers were very friendly, we all encouraged others to get our work done. The hardest part of the job was making sure our rating never went too low and we didn't get off task time, which could cause us to be terminated."
good,Gives everyone a chance to get their foot in the door during peek season. The job has a nice atmosphere where everyone is friendly and hard working.

good,"Managing a team of 17 on their day-to-day production with quality control."
good,i would clock in an we would have to look on the board to see what we were doing that day usually I would be packing most of the time but some times I work sort I loved to do both so it didn't matter where they would put me after we found out what we was going to do we would do a ten minute work out stretch our bodys out before we start we would go to our station an when the bell wrong we started working our co-workers or managers that was in our section would walk around and see if there was any problems or needed help with any thing.the hardest part of the job was trying to keep my rate up all day till it was time to go but I was able to do it 95% of the time I loved being able to work in a fast environment and still get my job done with out hurting my self or any one else..an the most enjoyable part was seeing my name on the board every couple of hours cuz my rate was always high
good,"Everyone was very friendly, helping. Job environment was great.no complaints. Hour lunches , very flexible schedules. Supervisors and manger were great to work with."
good,"People always were ready to help. That was our job, to help customers figure out and solve problems. You were constantly surrounded by people that knew something you didn't and were capable of helping and teaching. You were always learning, and the meetings were interactive and fun. They asked for your opinions, because your opinions mattered. There were so many different formats to make sure that the same issue never occurred twice. My co-workers were always inviting and friendly, and there would be pot lucks and pizza parties anywhere from once to twice a month depending on work flow and percentages. The hardest part of the job, would have been maintaining the calm and collected format for the customers that were frustrated. Everyone always had a different way about handling these situations and if you were struggling there was some one there to help guide you in a better way. The most enjoyable part of the job was the way the rewarded you. Every month they would collect the percentages and reward you with different amazon exclusive prizes. The team meetings were always a blast as well, always learning about new methods to solve issues, and new amazon exclusives."
good,"Amazon is a great place to work, and there is a lot of opportunity for promotions and recognition... as long as you put in the time and the hard work. It is definitely not an environment where you can coast (granted some people get by with it), but you get what you put in.

Also taking Mayday calls for kindle support. Management and co-workers worked as a team to make sure that each customer received consistent service. The hardest part of the job was to remember key words for searching for answers in the reference guides. That skill was achieved with time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the spirit days where we would dress up like something silly and eating yummy food, for example Seahawks gear day and grilled cheese and soup day."

For the most part management  whether in operations or safety has always been responsive and supportive to the Safety Specialist Team. The work place culture for the most part is energetic, and inquisitive. All of the team members feel as though they are part of something bigger, something special, making history!

They always cover safety tips because they want people to walk out the same way they walked in. There is no food allowed in your locker which they are assigned to you by HR. You are not allowed to put your own lock on the locker and they are very small. So don't even think about putting all those gift cards in there. LOL.We are given clear bags to bring our meds or hard candies into the work area. We only drink water which they have water filters on each floor. You must leave your cell phones in your locker or the car. We are not allowed to take them on the work floor. There is security checks when you come out for lunch or to go home but you walk in freely when coming to work.
