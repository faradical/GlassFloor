rating,review
bad,Transformation of the company post Scripps Acquisition is the focus. To be succuessful here you need to be willing to take on whatever is thrown at you.
bad,"Though I enjoyed my time at Discovery, it no longer exists therefore the low rating above. I enjoyed selling telescopes and other natural phenomena.  The windschimes were exceptional"
bad,"I worked at Discovery a little over 17 years.  I received a few promotions and awards during my tenure.  The morale of the company changed drastically when it became public.  From it's content to executive management,  Discovery no longer became ' the place to work' for me. Depending on how long you were employed at the company, many of my colleagues were forced to resign.  There is no longer stability.  Discovery has become it's own shark tank!"
bad,Once a great place to work but constant reorganization that often removes high performing senior executives and creative staff has made Discovery a shadow of its former self.
bad,"Discovery was not a great place to work they did not value the people working there the supervices where word and didnt not know how to manage or keep people, over all i wasnt happy working there,"
bad,"This is the television industry so you get alot of personalities and big egos."
bad,"Discovery Channel gave me the opportunity to work both in front of the camera as talent, and behind as writer and some producer capacities. Learned many facets of how a television series is produced."
bad,I had to leave this position because the store closed. While I worked there the company was tough to work for. I was forced to cover a long term leave without a pay increase.
bad,"This company as a whole is a great company. Benefits are great and you receive a yearly 10% bonus. Management was ok for the most part, I have nothing negative to say about them. The training session is GREAT.  Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I will focus on the master control operator position at the Sterling, Va Broadcast center.  It is very hard to move up and advance due to its political bureaucracy. One would have to be working there for upwards of 6 years to be awarded any kind of advancement. Previous master control experience is not a determining factor in compensation, well at least for me it wasn't.  Since we are on compensation I will have to say that it is very poor.  This poor compensation is due to the fact they want to attract younger employees with little to no master control experience.  Very little is done to boost morale, and yes I'm going to echo a previous review and talk about the rock, paper, scissors tournament.  If that is your idea of morale boosting, then you would enjoy your job.  The policies have a high-schoolish ring to them.  No phone usage in the master control pod (yet it is ok to talk to co-workers on the intercom system for the whole 8 hour shift), and you have to ask to go to the bathroom and sometimes those bathroom requests are delayed in being granted."
bad,"It's fun place to work, It's below average company to work."
bad,"We sold specialty products in this store so it was hard to meet sales goals. Every department had similar goals, but the products varied from keychains to telescopes in the departments. I learned how to work in a retail environment and deal with customers in this job. The management was sweet, for the most part. I enjoyed the products we sold, as well."
bad,"The new culture treats employees like they are disposable.  They used to reward those that worked hard and had several years of service.  The new trend is money is more important.  I know as a business they need to make profit to continue business, however, there is a lot to say about hard work and loyalty.  It is a great place as a stepping stool but do not plan on staying."
bad,"Loved the onsite doctors office."
bad,"I found that Discovery sounds to be a great place to work as they often win awards for the work environment. However, in my office, which is not the main corporate offices, the atmosphere is drastically different. Employees are strongly discouraged from seeking additional skills that would allow them to branch out and grow as employees. Often times people that lack the needed skills are advanced due to personal relationships with management, leaving the regular employees misguided and lost."
bad,"Discovery seems to want to create shows which appeal to the worst in the human spirit: Being a conniving jerk (Fast N' Loud) or make fun of different people (all of TLC). Now they want to apply the same formula of ""drama at any cost"" to HGTV, which is ruining the brand"
bad,Big disappointment. Always wanted to work here. Found the atmosphere draining. Everyone is nervous about their job. Most jobs listed already have an in-house person for that position. Not friendly.
bad,"I worked here in college. Interns don't get much of a chance to show off their skills, they get pigeonholed into doing small tasks like posting blogs, web content management and marketing stuff. if you want to be in front of the camera this isn't the place to work. its a gigantic company and its easy to feel invisible and replaceable. I walked out on the job one day because I was so bored and no one ever found out. that's how invisible you are"
bad,Great Brand.  Leadership chases initiatives that are unimportant. Race to digital is slow still a lot of reliance on tranditional TV viewing.  Losing ground to Netflix
bad,"The company is in a state of uncertainty due to a recent merger. Identity crisis is how it would be best described the environment at the moment. Lack of leadership and the clear message of only caring about shareholder value, sends the wrong message to employees and brings morale down."
bad,"I am grateful for the opportunity that Discovery has given me these passed 2 years.  Yet the company is full of despotism, rarely seeking the right person for the job, only looking to their closest friends for an open position.  Managers in my department do not understand my job.  Employees must often seek their own answers for technical problems, or handle their own problems, often by seeking out the HR rep.  The master control department is very slow in promoting, often having to wait upwards of 10+ years for a single promotion."
bad,"Discovery is having problems finding itself in this era of cord cutting and has been shedding employees like crazy for the past three years. "
bad,"Management constantly goes through restructures, which affects team dynamics and kills morale. Coworkers are nice, benefits are good. Need to add a little more diversity to New York office and Los Angeles office."
bad,"Fine for the experience and the ability to put this on my resume, but I didn't enjoy the actual company/team/culture. I spent most of my time alone in a cubicle. Didn't learn a ton and wasn't upset when the internship ended."
bad,sort & distribute mail/packages throughout the building. Prepare outgoing mail for international & demotic shipping
good,"I would say overall the company is great. However, there is not much movement or growth. It is also somewhat political. If your boss doesn't like you, you will not do well."
good,"It's been fifteen years since I worked there, and the store closed about twelve years ago."
good,Just like any other media company.  No real understanding of what made them great either from a brand perspective or a workplace environment.  All over the map on any given day.  Constant fear of staff reduction
good,"I spent a good rewarding year at this place. I love the people I met and I have good memories. Job-wise was too intoxicating, the hours demand of the people at the bottom was crazy. Once you are at a full-time position is another deal. Perhaps is even better but I doubt is too much better. The working hours and the repetitiveness of the projects will burn you out. My advice if you ever get there do your job get the experience and leave, for good."
good,"Very chaotic environment. There are a lot of people at discovery who are inexperienced and lack key skills for their job. Managers also lack skills in their key position. You really have to break things down to the lowest level to communicate. I would advise a company to hire top talent, pay them well, and try to keep them for long."
good,"You'll have a hard time getting in. The work is fascinating but I've heard many horror stories from former and repeat employees. My experience was good, but my time there was perhaps too brief to make a complete assessment."
good,"I worked freelance for a production company for a show based out of Denver, Co. I loved the show and the people that were saving animals. The company was out of state, so I can’t say much of the goings on back at the mothership."
good,"You receive a bonus. You receive compensation for your work. You receive accolades for doing your job.These are the basic building blocks for having happy employees and a successful company. Discovery is very good at seeming like a good place to work, but underneath the surface lies insane competition, management afraid of some sort of worker uprising, and tired employees."
good,"Long hours starting at 9.30 am in the morning extending upto 8 pm or 9 pm in the evening."
good,The staff moral is really bad and no team work everyone is there to cut the next guy. The company is good but the staff that work in the GOC are not working as a team it is more of I do my work for paycheck.
good,"A very corporate organisation as you would expect form a US based global communications company. "
good,"So much happens so fast in the TV world. When you're up it's great, but when things are tough, management gets ousted, departments get slashed, and strategies go out the window. It's a hamster wheel, and employees hang on for March bonus time."
good,Now this was a crazy show. We built stuff only to destroy it. The ideas were completely insane and yet we built every single one. It was a lot of fun to work on.
good,"Days are normal, you learn a lot with little assistance, and management  is lacking the human side of an organization. The company tries to appear as if they care however they fall short due to management practices and consistent lay-offs."
good,"Discovery has been a great school for me throughout the years. It's been a great place to work but there is definitely NO room for growth in this company, that is the biggest and heaviest downfall. off you are looking to build your resume, by all means, but if you are looking to advance in your career, this isn't the place to be."
good,"I worked at Discovery Communications for 3 years. "
good,Very political. They don't really care about your career growth. Upper management is very condescending and don't want to help others grow.
good,"Great company if you are single or don't want to be home very much. Management is great, it's just a very demanding environment."
good,"Work is not rocket science, but can be challenging at times.  If your idea of employee participation is an annual Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament (NOT making that up), and have minimal to no master control experience, this could be the place for you to start out."
good,"The work-life balance at Discovery could be better.  Often times you are asked to be checking e-mails and such on weekends, and working late hours.  This is due to the fact that there are multiple offices around the world with multiple time-zones.  With the well documented acquisition of Scripps Networks, a lot of change is happening, including the main HQ's moving to New York."
good,"I thought it was different but it wasn't. It is unfortunate, but it is a great company as a whole, which stands for great things. Just a large company so politics do come into play etc."
good,"I started working at Discovery fresh out of college.  This company has shaped me into the professional I am today.  I admire the leadership and their desire to grow and expand the brand.  As much as I enjoy working with this company, it's time for me to move on and embark on a new journey that will be strengthen my professional skills and challenge my knowledge."
good,"Standard corporate job. Good benefits, but management does not care much about the folks under them. The company goes through a lot of changes, but they do not relay these important messages to the rest of the company."
good,Recent changes in the C level management has shifted the direction of the company yet again before the last round of changes were really able to bear any fruit.  
good,Company is for those of strongly focused business mindset and many employees lack a team oriented mentality. Employees are continually strategic and searching for opportunities to set themselves apart and gain promotion.  Telecommunication industry is in the midst of fundamental change  and layoffs are possible at all major companies. Still this a company with great brands and some core channels especially with the Scripps Acquisition.
good,"Company is in transition due to recent merger with Scripps and changes in the media industry, such as the rise of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other OTT/SVOD services.."
good,My time spent at Discovery was made more enjoyable because of the people that I worked with more than the job itself. It started to get very stale at the end.
good,"Lack of support,  lots of autonomy, no sales training program, great onboarding for product knowledge, competitive. mission driven but also bottom line."
good,"due to a recent merger, and being part of the merged in people, i'm unable to make serious judgments on the work culture at discovery being i've not been there long enough."
good,"The people and work environment are great, but the company has dealt poorly with changes in the media landscape and is struggling to keep up, making aspects of the job frustrating."
good,Great Place to work. Building is cool. But there are a little opportunities for advancement. There are only certain kind of people who get promoted. Management is not help accountable for their actions
good,I worked with some wonderful people here. It is a shame that the company closed down.
good,"great people, nice location, easy going employees, study leave possible"
good,The New York office houses many different departments. One thing that is evident across the board is the pride employees have in the Discovery brand.
good,I worked as a freelancer. I was a writer who submitted material for internet spots and TV. I would write and then submit to the producer who then would take the credit for my work. It almost seemed like he made up pay rates based on the budget they were allowing him. Who knows -- it was a job.
good,"it was alright place, had seasonal work got to play with cool toys."
good,I rather not say anything about the company. My experience Is  different from everyone else's experience. I have experienced a lot of ups and downs in my small time here at discovery
good,"Vertical department structures that prevent growth within career in a timely manner. "
good,This was once a great and fun company to work for. Times in the Miami office were wonderful and relatively smooth. Management had its faults but was overall great to work with. Coworkers felt like family. But once CEO ZAZLAV came around. The company went in to the toilet. While he gave himself huge raises every year. The company brand took a dive. Final straw was the move of broadcast operations to Sterling VA on June 2015. Worst mistake of my life to move up there for a year. Management in Virginia were and still are in over there heads. Wish they left our Miami office alone. We had a good thing going here.
good,"Discovery offers fantastic benefits and a plethora of helpful perks, including telecommunting in the Digital division. However, the constant change and lack of communication from the top hinder career progression and constant reorgs make it difficult for even top performers to make the level of impact that they want to."
good,"Great place to work, but don't plan on retiring there. I had just recieved my bachelor's degree and had started training with the IT department at discovery and three weeks in they had a massive layoff and the people I was being trained by were laid off permanently."
good,"Great company with great benefits and some good co workers and some of the learning tools was very good, they offered a day out of the year to give back t the community"
good,"Management was always changing so it is hard to give an accurate description of Management. However, everyone was super nice and super helpful. I would still work there if it wasn't for the fact that they lay off every year."
good,"A typical day at Discovery involves drafting contracts from forms, preparing contracts to be processed, upload fully-executed contracts to the system, and returning an electronic, fully-executed copy to the producer.  "
good,Leadership is clueless of the morale across the offices and workforce. The culture here has changed drastically from the early years within the education division. Many people are just sticking around for the flexibility and the benefits.
good,"While in my current position at Discovery Communications, I am learning a lot about myself and the company."
good,"1. Able to implement artistic directions and solutions"
good,"Not much time there, left after being acquired."
good,They even have a free doctors office inside. This was the best place to work.
good,"It's a good place to work and explore your knowledge in media company."
good,"Enjoyed working in this environment, great colleagues, dynamic fun activities around, plenty of restaurants, eat houses and shops within easy reach, transport aplenty."
good,"process accounts payable , great compensation and benefits , terrible management"
good,"I learned a lot while at Discovery, along with meeting GREAT people. Don't have anything nice to say about upper management / high level executives (CEO, HR President, etc.)."
good,"Discovery does not pay well.  It's CEO got a 47 million dollar bonus last year but if you are the ones doing the work, don't expect to get paid for it or get a good raise.  The cleaning staff has to do 8 hours of work in 5 hours so they don't get paid as full time employees.  This is not a company who cares about it's employees and every so often purges the higher paying professionals to bring in interns and inexperienced people who they can pay almost nothing."
good,I started as part-time cashier and would demonstrate new toys in front of the store for customers. I was offered a full-time position after the holidays was over and became the all around guy. I could do it all in the store just name it. I liked my manager and had a fun time working there
good,The turmoil in the entertainment industry has put great strain on the company. It continues to go through layoffs and restructuring. Hopefully this will pass as it is a great place to work.
good,"I worked at Discovery for 3 years and watched at least three rounds of layoffs. The co-workers, benefits, work environment, and pay are great. However it is clear that the greed of higher ups has effected the way they do business and the corporate culture. Management is back stabbing and looking out for themselves, as they have to be when no ones job is secure."
good,"Seek out and develop new sales proposals."
good,"I very much enjoyed my tenure at Discovery. I worked on one of the biggest channels, Discovery Espanol. Had a great trainer. I was able to close 2 to 3 logs daily with minimal errors."
good,I had to move on from Discovery channel before they moved to NYC. Good place to work overall and flexible remote as needed is great. They were always looking forward in training for new technologies and solutions . very liberal with training hours and going to events to get more information.
good,Pretty awesome company I love freelance working in the film industry I only hope to acquire more connections. I have the flexibility and I feel my work efforts are justly compensated.
good,Media based company.  Fun people to work with.  Company changes constantly with new media platforms.  Great opportunities for individuals looking to be part of the media industry.
good,"Discovery Communications was a great place to work. Although I was a contractor, I still was able to benefit many opportunities which were offered to full time staff. Great people and culture."
good,Discovery Communcations is a great place to work and provides employee's with great tools for growth. Very accomodating with work life balance and employee amazing people.
good,"Great work environment for all.  Support all communities and great benefits for you and your family.  wellness center, training, time off for volunteering and overall great support."
good,The environment at Discovery Communications is warm and welcoming. I felt like part of the team within my first few days of employment and the training I received enabled me to perform my tasks efficiently.
good,"They run a professional operation there.  It's obvious you're working for an industry leader with a high standard of excellence. (Although, standards have dropped a little and a dropping.) "
good,"Discovery is a great company overall with the benefits, and work-life balance (per manager's discretion). But it seems to grow within the company is very slow."
good,"It was nice to work in Discovery Communications."
good,"I've learned and developed my self with Discovery, a lot of support from the senior team which helped me move into management and looking after the IT Infrastructure at Discovery Education."
good,"I am not a salaried employee of Discovery Channel and so cannot write about the work atmosphere there. I am a freelancer for the channel and work from home. "
good,Discovery has a lot of great television networks and is constantly growing and changing.  It is a fast paced company and offers many unique challenges.
good,Discovery was a great place to learn many new and exciting things. They treat the interns with respect and there is always something fun going on in the office. It was a great experience.
good,"Working at Discovery was a good experience overall. Top TV networks, Oxygen, TLC, OWN, Discovery channel, Animal Planet, the pay was very low, and it is hard to move up in the business."
good,My account executive allowed for each advertising sales intern to participate in a week-long sales training. This training made me appreciate my contribution to the teams goals each day.
good,"I have been very fortunate to be a part of Discovery for a little over 9 years now. I have learned how to communicate, build and maintain great relationships with various groups. My co-workers are a true joy and some have become great friends. A typical day for me would consist of ensuring all commercial matters are resolved prior to air. The hardest part is obtaining resolutions with little to late notice of air time, however it always gets done!"
good,Discovery channel store was a great place to work. Many of the things on the tv channel you got to see many interesting gadgets. Telescopes big habitats
good,Some great people who have strong industry knowledge. A place that is shifting its culture and work flow. Some strong global brands that are strong contenders in the pay tv space.
good,"I interned at Discovery Communications, and the intern program was very well. It brought together students from all over the country and set them up to work hand in hand with leader on real projects. It fostered great camaraderie, and interns enjoyed the many perks of the office."
good,My manager hated me. She lost a coworker and friend in layoffs at the company. I was the replacement that was forced upon here by her boss (who's my friend). She didn't like that too much. Oh well.
good,"There's always something new to learn at The Discovery Channel Store. enjoyed working with peers and customers. Products range from jewelry to telescopes to children's toys, so you are never bored."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Discovery but mainly because of my team. It's a good company with good values and they try hard to make their employees happy. But like many large corporations, they slow down and take fewer risks and become cumbersome. They answer to shareholders more than the call to innovate and create. So the work was not as exciting as one might think it would be at a company called Discovery. "
good,"It was a very gratifying experience working for a great company like this. This place has good energy and people are very friendly. In addition to this, most of the people are very professional."
good,Eu era capaz de mostrar os meus melhores esforços com sucesso como o único estagiário do departamento publicitário em Nova Iorque no momento. O meu chefe me deu a liberdade de ser criativo e pensar independentemente.
good,"Discovery has recently undergone massive changes. There has been a lot of things that happened that were less than agreeable but also quite common with reforming a company's structure."
good,"Great benefits such as 401k plan. They have their own medical doctor on site, and you are able to pick up meds right then and there. Good people to work with."
good,Discovery Communications is home to some of network television's major channels. Having the opportunity to start my career in advertising has been exceptional. I have gained the skills and knowledge to further my career.
good,"Typical days are about 9 hours.  In my current role, I've been exposed to a large portion of the operational environment, and IT security processes.  Management works with their people, and overall the company takes care of its employees.  The hardest part of the job is maneuvering the corporate environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture...people are genuinely happy"
good,I've worked for Discovery on and off for a decade on various projects. They've always given me a creative license to produce content they need while allowing for creativity and flexibility.
good,"I was sooooooo excited to finally get a chance to work for Discovery. It was a dream come true after applying years way before getting hired.  It was great and all my co-workers were great.  I thought I had found the job of my dreams till a new manager came in to mess it all up. It's crazy to see how one person can just ruin a good thing. Oh well, I am grateful to Discovery for the opportunity and learning so much!  I met some amazing people that I'm still in contact with them."
good,"Discovery has been a good place to work. It offers good work-life balance and good benefits including on-site day care, doctor/nurse offices, and parental leave."
good,Great place to  work. Value is found in share price as is executive compensation. Recent layoffs do not help the majority of the company.
good,"Domestically, Discovery Communications is in transition, moving from a strictly cable media company. For example, a stronger focus has been but on digital media."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Interesting product and very enjoyable experience when interacting with the Field teams.
good,This was a great store to work at always a fun and positive atmosphere. The holidays were always crazy but fun with large amounts of people looking to keep up with the TV shows merchandise that we carried. Always a great place to find the new and cutting edge products.
good,I like working in different department keep it interesting for me. I like to help coworkers and solve problems when i have  any down time at work.  The hardest part i would say about my job would be making sure i remember all the important procedure from each department. One mistake from me could cost the company big $$$.  The most enjoyable part for me  is i feel like i have 3 jobs because i work in 3 different department weekly and i work all shifts so i like my job and i make it fun
good,Great people! Managers support advancing your career. A young workforce. And overall great energy.
good,I was able to work with the editorial department as well as the digital media department. Being open to versatile opportunities and experiences makes you experience that much more worthwhile.
good,"Is assisting the Asia/India region with Content accounting.  The local staff is willing and wanting to be the best at thei jobs even with my location Silver Spring being 13,000 miles away.   We have grown in keeping the Discovery content accounting process accurate and running smoothly."
good,"In my 8 years at Discovery I learned professionalism, and had many opportunities and ideas were allowed to grow, and encouraged.  There was a lot of stress free travel, and i was allowed to work with a team or alone."
good,"Discovery Communications provided excellent work environment and work-life balance. Hours are flexible, and the atmosphere is relaxed, given the intensity of the work."
good,"A typical day would consist of opening or closing shift, stocking the store and sales. Management was the coolest and coworkers were like family. The hardest part of the job was it was a small transit store so it was tight space for stock room, no bathroom or break area you had to use the parent facilities. The enjoyable part was the cool new products we sold and the variety of tourists as customers."
good,"Lots of great smart people work here. Unfortunately, not much of a work/life balance. Lots of fun opportunities depending on your position. There is no typical work day."
good,"This job has provided me with the opportunity to glimpse at how shows are developed and produced from the perspective of the company's front desk."
good,Fun workplace with great people and a very balanced work / life atmosphere.  A great place to start your career and grow.  Lots of movement with a clear career path.
good,"I have no major complaint about the Discovery Channel Store, from my personal experience I will stay that the company did not advertise enough to draw a following, nor did they create a retail brand that was recognized across the country. What I did enjoy was the product assortment and the culture of the company."
good,Work life balance is wonderful. Solid work experience gained throughout the years.  I would recommend working at this company for anyone interested in growing within an ad-sales division.
good,"Hard working, collaborative staff working for Discovery Communications networks. Great company benefits, good work/life balance. Great ratings = great success!"
good,Lead sales manager. great job when in school. learned leadership and people skills.
good,My first job for a big company after grad school. Great opportunity to learn how a billion dollar media company functions. Sometimes workload can be demanding but it's part of the business. Free food some days and laughter even when things are stressful.
good,"This company often has department with an exciting, entrepreneurial spirit. I learned a lot. Great people to work with."
good,"- Most of the time my typical days are very busy."
good,"I enjoyed working there.  Most of the people were nice, and the culture was pretty fun with a lot of opportunities to learn and grow.  The management was supportive without micromanaging."
good,"typically daily job is full of fun and laugh, great and fair leadership. work and life balance, at the same time, learn skills and technologies as trained well."
good,"Great place to become battle tested. Like most organizations today, very financially driven at every level. Lots of smart and hard-working people even in the face of a massive transformation in advertising."
good,Great place to work for! Good management with nice benefits and incentives. Always looking out for their employees. Despite been a bit busy you will enjoy working here.
good,"Overall experience was a positive one. When I was there, the people wer easy to work with and support. There was however a lack of leadership from my manager at the time."
good,Discovery was a great place to begin my career and allowed for a ton of learning opportunities and growth. You learn from the best in the industry and there is a ton of support.
good,"It was a fun place to work, some management listened to staff but hours were way too long. There needs to be a better balance of work and private life."
good,"People are great, received many courses to grow and stay current. Company benefits were great. In house wellness center for employees. Current situation in company with regionalization to Latin America and layoffs has made it a difficult work environment and has lowered employee morale."
good,"Company Commitment to advanced broadcast systems meant constant challenges to keep up with more sophisticated workplace."
good,Banyan Productions had very high quality workplace culture.  It encouraged creativity and resourcefulness at it's fundamental core.  It was a truly unique and exciting professional experience.
good,Innovative ideas and groundbreaking work in all areas of Media and Communication.
good,Good learning experience.  Experiencing work in all kinds of platforms.
good,"Discovery, the home of Honey Boo Boo, Mythbusters, Deadliest Catch and so on, is an enormously fun place to work.  You will learn a great deal about the reality TV market and watch as this company just grows!"
good,I really enjoyed working for Discovery. Overall I left because I wanted to move and my job isn't currently set up to do remotely. I would go back immediately if they would invest in the platform to allow for remote video editing. The technology is out there and it'd beyond me why they haven't taken advantage of it yet.
good,"Excellent company to work for. Fun workplace, great team, and awesome perks, like the ability to WFH as needed. Always looked forward to going to work."
good,"I was a previous Scripps employee, Discovery acquired Scripps and changes have been.  It has been a adjustment period.  Which I enjoy change.. Thank you the opportunity."
good,Always enjoy the workplace. Positively challenging to help users solve various issues ranging for a poor response time from the network to a bad throughput from edge devices
good,"I love to work there however,  I need to more stable income and also They have moved to different location which is far away from my home."
good,Great company to work for. Great culture and benefits. I recommend anyone to work at this company. I would definitely work here again if I could. I liked the management.
good,The culture at Discovery is awesome. It's very collaborative and the benefits and perks are great. It's too bad they're shutting down the HQ in Maryland.
good,Technology driven.  Very collaborative between departments but a bit unstable as of recent changes.  Great benefits and accommodating work life balance.
good,Discovery Communications rewarded and acknowledged team for good performance.   They had a good company culture that others should embrace.  For the most part they treated their employee well.
good,Discovery is a forward thinking leader in the media space.  They care about their employees and try to provide work life balance.  Its's a good company to start or continue your career.
good,"Very employee-focused with great benefits.  It's a shame they went public as the previous culture was even better.  Significant focus on the bottom line, creating a challenging environment of cost-cutting."
good,"Overall Discovery is a great company, fast pace environment, good team work, and great co-workers. the company has a clear map of the goals its wants to accomplish in the period and provides all resources necessaries to accomplish this. At times it can become stressful."
good,"This is a great company to observe the different departments with in operations. "
good,"Its very good to work at Discovery."
good,A very friendly environment with a very diverse workforce and management. The benefits are very good. You are given every opportunity to move upward in your career and to learn various department positions.
good,"Discovery Comm has a lot of great people with tons of experience. It's very buttoned-up in a lot of ways, but it's not the most glamorous job. It can tend to have that ""office space"" feel sometimes. But if you have the drive to network and learn, you can go far. Discovery has the best employees and they all have great personalities."
good,Busy days but every day is different. I've grown a lot careerwise since being here. Would recommend to others.
good,"This was a great place and hopefully the new company will be just as good, however they have reduced their presence in Maryland and there's no place for me here any longer."
good,"This is a great place to work, very good for parents. Culture is very relaxed and depending on department is very flexible to work with your needs and any last minute crisis that happens in life. Provides excellent benefits and discounts and ALOT of perks that are available. You need to be willing to do a lot of work outside of you job description and outside of normal business hours. Also is a lot of room for ambitious and 'go getter' people, those who push to grow yourself and your position."
good,The work culture is shifting to the demands of the millenial generation which can be great to keep the vision innovative and creative for the overall mission of Discovery's mission.

good,"Fun place to work with great co-worker who are committed to help in order to make my job easier."
good,"Great company and culture for young people. So many different departments where one can move to, or at least talk with. Room to grow and learn in a company with so many assets"
good,"Discovery has so many diverse business interests it would be impossible to become bored there. The work environment is mostly very positive, with great employee support programs in place. The only downside is the constant re-aligning of goals and the re-organizations, but that is the case with any large media company today."
good,No two days the same with highly-motivated employees to accomplish the same goals. I have learned how to manage multiple projects while taking in walk-ins for troubleshooting errors or problems on their mobile devices and laptops. The environment is very welcoming and family-oriented with a sense of wanting to help one another in any way they can. It's a fun place to be and great company to work for when working within the corporate structure.

The company started to change their product and felt that the company was not doing so well and decided to leave. Within two years Discovery Channels Stores closed down."

good,I had a tremendous amount of fun at Discovery Communincations and i would absolutely recommend this workplace to anyone if they had the chance. Management was very kind and informative. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the pay and benefits. You were suffuciently taken care of with pay.

good,"due to the lawsuit against Microsoft by its contractors, Discovery began limiting their contractors (90% of its workforce), to terms of no more than one year.  Makes it hard to settle in and get work done with revolving door of personnel."
good,"Designing has been my lifestyle and working with this wonderful company made my love for graphic design grow. Days with discovery channel was lovely, the CEO is a team player and carry all his employees along"
good,I was mostly self paced in my position with some oversight from my direct supervisor. As long as I kept my output at or above expectancy then there were never any issues. There was tons of opportunities for advancement and was a competitive but also laid back work environment.

good,"My experience at Discovery Communications was a positive one overall. There were times when the work was a little monotonous, but the internship was fast-paced and exciting for the most part."
good,Great Place to work.  Exciting place and the Ad Sales Team is the best.  The people are a family and everyone works together.  Very talented and skillful employees.

good,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome Place to work with, the best tv content in the world."
good,The hardest part of the job was working with the graphics team due to the fact I am not a graphics designer however I learnt a lot. I worked in all departments ranging from design and HR to office work and tech work.
good,"I was already good at greeting customers,but I learned to demonstate toys for the customer and assisst with purchases. The co-workers were all helpful. The most enjoyable part was demostating the toys"

good,"A great company, that is interested in making you a useful intern.  All of management was extremely helpful and I was able to work on a very rewarding project throughout the entirety of the internship."
good,If I was working the morning shift since I was an assistant manager I would unlock the store and turn off the alarm. I would check updated from my boss on our computer to see if there were special requests asked of me and my employees to do that day. Then would fill out a work chart so employees would know everything that needed to get completed. I would open the registers and count the money in the drawers to make sure they all added up to $200 including change. My employees would come in about this time and we would open for business. I have learned what it takes to be a good manager and an excellent team leader and team player. I also learned how by providing excellent customer service how great the customers satisfaction can really be. I enjoyed working with my boss and we worked well together as a team to assist our employees with any concerns or problems they might incur. My co-workers were a great bunch of people that were dedicated to learning and doing their job in a correct and timely manner. To me there was nothing I could say about this being a hard job. Yes it was difficult sometimes but my co-workers and I always figured out a way to make things work out in the end. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing we all worked great as a team and also knowing if anyone had a problem I was the one they would come to for an answer or solution.
good,Sales oriented. Upper management was very cutthroat if sales goal wasn't met (at the time). Closed now.
good,"My day consisted of hosting events, making sales and guiding other members of my team as a lead. I learned a lot about different cultures in my time at this job. The management treated my co-workers and I as if we were equals and we all worked amazingly well together. The hardest part of this job was having to relocate and leave it. The most enjoyable part of this job was that it was located in the middle of San Francisco."
good,- Fun and innovative environment.
good,"Good company to work for over all."
good,"This company was a great first step into the corporate world. I interned for the HR dept in Lifeworks and Diversity division. I was the general intern for the team of 5 employees. Each employee helped me in different ways, having me do various tasks to teach me new things. I was not treated like a basic intern, they really wanted me to help with key research and data analysis instead of just getting coffee and filing papers. I was also giving a great opportunity while working there to meet with any employee in any field as I wanted. This gave me a look into the workings of the company and each department. I was encouraged to reach out and learn as much as I could, which is what I did. The only negative was it was an unpaid internship, that I had to be earning college credit for so I had to basically pay to be an intern, but this was worth it in the end."
good,"It was difficult to get a raise, I loved the people I worked with but really needed the opportunity to get more more. the next job I took I was able to do that."
good,"Discovery was short but a great company to work for. It's a very professional environment conducive to learning, growing and developing a career. Times are hard at Cable Networks, but providing they see the opportunities in the digital space and the ever changing audience, Discovery will continue to be strong."

The dynamic nature of the television and digital industries make Discovery an exciting and challenging place to work. As the industry is in constant evolution, everyday we were faced with new challenges and opportunities expand our knowledge and be better professionals."
good,"Technology changes constantly and so do daily processes. Aside from learning a new workflow every once in a while, the job is pretty constant. Overnight workers are quiet and laid back and will laugh at about anything. Management does their best to communicate needs and expectations from top to bottom and vice versa. The hardest part of the job is some of the content you have to watch."
good,"Discovery Communications is an absolutely awesome place to work. The people are amazing, the vibe is super fun, and the atmosphere is enviable. The company is part of so many fantastic initiatives and has such a great variety of shows on its channels that you cannot help but feel a sense of pride working there. There are many activations in the office, especially for Shark Week and the Puppy Bowl, and there always seems to be free food."
good,"As a working mother, I struggle with being a good mom and being good at what I do.  I can honestly say Discovery has been an amazing place to really enforce work life balance.  With on-site day care, wellness, fitness and options to telework, I've been able to juggle my career and shuttle kids to girl scouts, sports, doctors, and talent shows.  Although my salary could be improved, I think Discovery makes up  for it with other benefits."

good,Good palce to work with lots of enthusiastic people. Great place to gain a range of experiene and skills. Good mentality on training and improving staff.

good,"I worked in the Consumer Insights/Corporate Research department and loved the challenges that I faced every day. I was a research strategist for a couple of different networks during my time at the company. I provided ratings analysis for the daily/weekly programs  and provided insights to the programming/scheduling department to create opportunities to gain traction and keep viewers engaged and coming back. Also, I worked with the consumer insights team to track how our target audiences were consuming their media choices. We tried to keep their engagement and stay up-to-date while continuing in the standard cable environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay relevant while countering the cord-cutting preferences emerging from the millennial generation and spreading to general public. I most enjoyed the culture and camaraderie of working these challenges next to such creative and supportive staff."
good,"Discovery cares about you and your lifestyle. You are not overworked, so can maintain a work life balance. The offices are quiet, however, the teams care about one another and work well together to be sure everything gets completed."
good,Discovery Networks latin America was like a dream come true.  It was my first job and the longest in the United States. We were always motivated and bennefits were incredibly good
good,"The relationship between management and staff is very lose. There is constant communication both formal and informal. A typical workday is the open discussions held to discuss how to better serve the clients. Management is open minded and spend a lot of time on the floor among the workers. Co-workers got along very well and shared mutual respect. They were also supportive of each other and very team oriented."
