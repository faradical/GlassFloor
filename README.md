## Background
GlassFloor is a website dedicated to the use of machine learning algorithms to track sentiment towards companies, most notably on social media, with the aim of revolutionizing the way companies engage with their customers. It was designed as a final project for the Georgia Tech Data Science and Analysis bootcamp. It's current incarnation can be accessed at [this link](https://www.norstal.com/glassfloor/index.html).

## How it works
Taken from the website:

### Step 1) Data Collection
Our model was trained using a logistic regression machine learning algorithm based on over 2.1 million company reviews collected from across the web. Data for analysis can be collected from any where you can find discussions on your company in a digital format.


### Step 2) Machine Learning
Bag-of-Words approach was used to tokenize words. New review text data was fed in to predict whether a review is positive/negative. It's all very technical sciency dark magic.


### Step 3) Applications
Our model allows companies the revolutionary abilities to predict sentiment of future reviews based off of internal employee feedback, determine and analyze social media engagement, or even to collect public commentary over a longer time period to look for potential correlation between sentiment and company sales/performance or stock prices.
